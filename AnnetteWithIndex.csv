I did not do my surgery for pain relief, but for loss of function. That was restored immediately. You should have two surgical opinions from different surgeons who do not practice in the same group. Ask them both a lot of questions, and write down the answers to compare. How are you making arrangements for after your surgery, if you did not ask all these questions of your surgeon?

I personally do not believe in trying any surgical procedure until after one has tried ALL the non-surgical methods of controlling pain and failed in attaining adequate relief. Before deciding on a surgical procedure, I would get two opinions from independent surgeons who implant this sort of device. Not two from the same practice, but two from different practices. See if you are a good candidate for this procedure. Tell them up front you are just collecting information, and have not made a decision yet. Be sure and ask them what their infection rate is, as well as the rate of any other complications. Any doctor who tells you that his patients never get infected should scare you. One told my husband that when we were looking for a surgeon to replace his hip. We never saw him again. It sounds like you have already found one surgeon to interview, now you need to find another. I would also see a pain management specialist who manages pain with meds including opiates, and also uses other forms of pain management. I strongly feel that if I use several different treatment techniques and get a small amount of relief from each of them, the total amount of relief I can get can be substantial. Charles posted a link recently to research regarding injections and procedures and how well they work. I would find that and read it thoroughly. I would not consent to any invasive procedure unless I had evidence based medicine showing that it was of considerable benefit. I would also need to know how the doctor decided I would make a good candidate for the procedure. Choosing the right candidates is key. Only after doing all of this do I feel you can make an informed decision. Keep in touch. Take care, Annette"178,pharmaceutical therapy,"You only mentioned one long acting opiate, fentanyl patches. There are also a number of long acting opiates in oral form. There are also a number of other anti-nausea meds besides phenergan that you could try if nausea becomes a problem. Usually, nausea will go away with time on opiates. There are also other meds that can be used for pain management in the antidepressant family. They mediate the neurotransmitters that control the perception of pain in the brain. By waiting until your pain is out of control to take your pain meds, you doom them to not working as well as they could. They should be taken early on in the pain escalation process. Medical studies done back in the 60s showed that people who took their opiates early on took less opiates than the people who waited until their pain was severe and then took their meds. They also got better relief. Most people with chronic pain who use opiates take a long acting opiate on a set schedule to maintain their blood levels so they don<APO>t have big up and down swings of pain relief. It is thought that this also slows the buildup of tolerance. Usually they also take a short acting opiate like Norco or Percocet for any breakthrough pain they have due to increased activity (or for no reason at all). They may take this 1-4 times a day depending on their doctor<APO>s instructions. Some people also take an anti-inflammatory for added relief depending on their condition and their previous medical history. You list RA, OA, and FMS, so it would be important that you control all your sources of pain. Your pcp<APO>s concern that if you get cancer you would have no pain meds available just isn<APO>t true. You can always take more pain meds if you need them, as long as you can tolerate any side effects, and are well supervised. There is no upper limit that one cannot go beyond with opiates while supervised by their doctor. Besides, you may never get cancer, you have pain NOW.

Then afterwards, it will relax the muscles, that should help with pain. FMS depends on the tender point examination to diagnose, this is completely different from trigger points. A tender point hurts right where the doctor pushes with his finger. A trigger point causes pain distal to the spot where the doctor pushes.

Take care, Annette"115,communication and learning about pain,"I believe that this is a drug that needs to be carefully prescribed by a doctor with experience. I worked in a heroin treatment facility in the 1970s that used methadone as one treatment method for heroin addiction. We didn<APO>t have any deaths in our client base in the years that I worked there. I am aware that in higher doses it can cause electrical irregularities in the heart that can cause death. It should NEVER be mixed with alcohol or benzos in my opinion. Those mix badly and can cause severe respiratory depression and death. But, this is something I learned nearly 40 years ago. I find people on these boards and others who routinely mix methadone and benzos with their doctor<APO>s blessing. I feel the doctors are to blame, not the drug itself. This is why I believe that it should be prescribed by doctors experienced in its use. Doctor<APO>s education is important here. I am a nurse, and a recent pain management class that I attended said one should not prescribe any opiates and benzos at the same time due to the risks involved in the interaction of these drugs. I think this is particularly important with methadone. One must start the methadone dose very low and increase it very slowly. Once you get to a dose that works, one can often decrease the dose somewhat and still get good pain relief. This is due to the extremely long half-life of the drug. Patients must absolutely stick to the dose the doctor gives them. NO EXTRA PILLS, ever. Methadone works differently than oxycodone or morphine, you can<APO>t double up on them when you feel like you need a bit of extra pain relief, or back down one day because you feel better, then increase them again the next day. You can die that way. I think this is a very useful drug in the right hands, prescribed by the right doctors."108,communication and learning about pain,"Only your doctor can make a medical diagnosis.

The FMS diagnosis is based on at least three months of pain above and below the waist, and on both sides of the mid-line of the body, a positive tender point test, and a lack of any other illness that would explain the symptoms. Most doctors do a variety of blood tests to rule out any other cause of the pain and fatigue. Everyone with FMS has a different experience, everyone with it has pain, fatigue is the second complaint.

The research I have read in nursing journals says that up to 5% of people who take opiates as directed for pain will become addicted to the meds. It is a psychological condition, but it is also based on neurological changes that happen in the brain when one takes these kinds of drugs. "100,pharmaceutical adverse effects,"There may also be a genetic predisposition in some people. Folks with their own medical history of drug abuse or a family history of drug abuse are often more likely to develop addiction themselves. That said, even folk with NO history of addiction can become addicts. Can recovering addicts be treated for pain with opiates successfully? Yes, with careful monitoring by both a pain management professional and an addictions specialist, some can use opiates successfully. I worked with opiate addicted people for my first job in nursing back in the 1970s. I am so glad I did. I NEVER take a pain pill without asking myself first if I really need it for physical pain, or am I taking it for a bit of an escape from life. I only take them for pain. Very few people with addictions are treated successfully, it is a horrible disease with far-reaching ramifications that reach through the friends and family of the addict in addition to the direct affect on the addict. Even if only 1% of opiate users became addicted, it would still be something we should all be aware of due to the seriousness of addiction. I never push the use of opiates on anyone, if they feel they are using their pain meds inappropriately, I believe them. The best person one can speak to regarding pain management vs. addiction is a trusted health care professional who is familiar with that person and their medical history. Thank you Gail, for bringing this topic to our attention and starting a discussion about it."99,pharmaceutical therapy,"I am an RN also, although I am disabled and not currently working. Everyone has their own opinion about using opiates for chronic pain. I feel it is fine and as long as I function better with them than without them, I will continue to use them. I don<APO>t find it necessary to tell everyone in my life about what kinds of meds I take. No one treats me like an addict. There are pain management clinics that aim to eliminate the use of opiates in all their patients. There are other pain management clinics that do not. I certainly recommend the latter. I think you should do anything you can to lower your pain levels, including using opiates. If you truly feel that you want to be off all the opiates, then work with your doctor on a tapering program. My husband had his hip replaced, and had less pain so he wanted to taper off of the methadone he had been on. We discussed it with his doctor and he tapered off with no withdrawal symptoms at all. He had stopped taking morphine years ago when he had cancer and he says he had no withdrawal symptoms then that was worse than a case of the flu, and it only lasted a few days. Everyone is different of course. Your doctor should be able to guide you through this. You can go one step lower on the patch, then switch over to an oral opiate for the end of the taper. If you feel that your pain becomes unmanagable at any point, you can always change your mind about stopping the opiates. Good luck."97,pharmaceutical therapy,"I totally agree with you about the small percentage of people who may develop addiction after using opiates, and that education is necessary for both the general population and our doctors so that people are given this option if they have pain. That said, it is not only folks who have a personal or family history of addiction that become addicts. Some people who have no history of addiction in themselves or their families become addicts. It may be that they were in a very vulnerable place in their life when they were introduced to opiates for their physical pain, and they ended up using them for the wrong reasons. "97,pharmaceutical adverse effects,"Because I have worked with addicts, and know how very serious addiction can be I believe that this should be one of the possible side effects that patients should be educated about. Not to scare them, but to inform them. Just like surgeons should always warn patients that infection is a risk of any incision through the skin. The surgeon that did my husband<APO>s hip replacement has a less than 4% infection rate, but he still told us about that possible risk.

Either pay for it yourself, or put it on your regular health insurance. Get an opinion from someone who has no financial interest in what you may or may not do next.

Do you have a copy of the form you filled out for the doctor who said you ""have no pain""? If that is what you actually said, then he is correct in his thinking you should go back to work. If you were careful in your documentation of your pain on this form, it should back you up. I would also suggest you hire a lawyer in the state where the w/c case has been filed. Many doctors insist that their medical assistants or nurses make ALL patients undress and put on a gown, regardless of what is wrong with them. This makes things move faster (for the doctor) if he decides you need further examination. Although I am a nurse, I have never heard of a nurse getting w/c for DDD of the spine because unless you had a specific injury, it is difficult to prove it is due to work.

Sometimes it means making more frequent appts. while adjusting meds or trying new treatments, but I feel that is worthwhile. For a doctor to speak to you on the phone, he must be told you have called, then he tells someone to pull your wife<APO>s records, he reads them briefly to refresh his memory (he probably has several hundred patients), then he finds the time between other patients<APO> appts. to call you. He feels rushed and pressured to keep his patient schedule going so he does not hold up the patients in the waiting room. The result is your wife does not get the same quality care as she would sitting across the room from him with the door closed, and her chart on the desk in front of him. Just my opinion. I take a note pad with me to my appts. and write down any changes in medication dosages, treatments, referals, etc. that she suggests. It is far too easy to forget exactly what was said a few days later.

I wish ALL doctors would do that, it would eliminate a whole lot of confusion and med errors. There is never any excuse for a member of the doctor<APO>s office staff to be rude to a patient or her family.

The only comment I have is that the way you describe taking your pain meds is not the way that is backed up by medical research. Even back when I was in nursing school, the late 60s, we were taught that one should take their meds before the pain gets ""so bad I can<APO>t stand it anymore"". By that time the meds just will not work as well. It is far better to take the meds when your base level of pain starts to go up. By doing this you will get better control of the pain with less narcotic medication. I read medical research way back then that showed people would end up using less narcotic pain meds and get better relief if they took the meds when the pain first started escalating, rather than waiting until it got really bad. I understand why people do that, I used to do it back when I was still able to work. I would drive home after a shift in the ER in tears because my legs hurt so bad, then take a hot bath and my pain meds. When I finally stopped working, one of my nurse buddies commented that now she hoped now I would take my meds properly and get my pain under decent control. She was right. I might have been able to continue to work had I done that sooner. The pain med patches that contain fentanyl should only be used by folks who are already taking opiates on a daily basis. There are specific doses of narcotic meds that pass that requirement. Speak to your doctor, he can let you know if the fentanyl patches are appropriate for you.

Of course, he should discuss that with you, along with the MRI results. A radiologist reads the films first, they are very conservative. I would trust my doctor to take a look at them and discuss them with me. Did you ask him about the initial MRI when it was first done? Maybe he thinks you are not a person who prefers to discuss things at all, but rather prefers the doctor to make the appropriate choice for you."4778,privacy,"Talk to the doctor about all of this, then if you wish to get your records, do so by simply asking for them in writing, it is best to include your birthday as verification of your identity.

Once you find out more information you can discuss treatment options with your doctor or a neurologist. Take care, Annette"3627,pharmaceutical therapy,"Neuropathy simply means a nerve or more than one nerve is not working properly. It is more of a symptom than a diagnosis. Many different things can cause neuropathy, from injury, to diabetes, to a stroke. Neuropathy may only affect sensory nerves causing pain, burning, tingling, etc., or it could cause motor problems making it difficult to move, or it could cause both. It can be permanent or temporary. I have had both, the motor nerve problem was fixed with surgery, but I still have pain from neuropathy of sensory nerves. It is great that you are having such a good result from neurontin after only 4 days, it could improve much more. I have used neurontin for nearly ten years now and once I found the dose that was best for me, I left it alone. I have no side effects at all. It took several months to find that dose. I went up to 1800 mg. a day, and then back down to 800 mg. a day.

The request will be forwarded to him or to wherever he stored your records. Doctors are required to store medical records for a certain length of time even if they give up their practice. Your parents should have insurance records that would include the name of the orthopedic doctor. It is likely your doctor spoke to him after he saw you and they decided you would benefit from seeing the ortho. You can also write him requesting all your old records from him. Take all the old records to the new ortho of your choice. You mention ""all my other pills"", what all are you on? There are many kinds of pill interactions, perhaps that has something to do with the reluctance of doctors to prescribe more opiates."615,primary care provider interactions," An ortho should be able to do tests now that show how well your leg healed, often hamstring tears do heal after a long time, even if you don<APO>t stay off of it like the doctor told you to do.

See an ortho, have whatever diagnostic imaging he feels is necessary, stick with whatever treatment he recommends for as long as he recommends, and see what happens. If after doing everything he recommends you still end up with chronic pain, then you can ask him for a referral to a pain management doc for oral meds to help control the pain. There are other meds besides opiates that are good for pain, try them all.

My husband needed a hip replacement, we already knew that when we saw the xray that showed the femoral head totally collapsed from AVN. I am an RN. The problem was that he also had a chronic Staph infection in a wound on his opposite leg, the wound was open and dressed with gauze of course. The surgeon said he would schedule surgery for two weeks from then, no comment when I asked him about the Staph infection, he never looked at it, never laid a hand on my husband except to shake his hand. Did no examination of any kind. When he sent his report to the primary doc, he claimed to have done all kinds of measurements, etc. We were charged for a complete first time exam, several hundred dollars. If the insurance company had not paid for it, we would have complained. My husband just wanted out of there. We never went back. "3108,surgical,"We went to another orthopedic surgeon who agreed to do the surgery only when the wound was completely healed for three months, a second surgeon said the same thing. He had successful hip replacement surgery three years ago, several months after the wound finally healed. He had to have vascular surgery before it finally healed. Thank God, no infections of any kind since. The orthopedic surgeon that my husband first saw was just in it for the money. However, with decent screening there are lots of fine doctors out there to choose from. I have had the same doctor for over 15 years now, you just must screen them carefully. But, use your own head too. Take care, Annette"3279,primary care provider interactions,"It is too bad that Charles made some wrong assumptions about your surgery. I am sorry that he did.

Take care, Annette"1312,surgical,"I would get 2-3 surgical opinions from different neurosurgeons in different practices. Then sit down with your husband (hopefully he went to your appts. with you) and talk about the various things that were said. I doubt you will ever have whatever it is you think a normal life is. Back injuries change lives forever. First you need to accept that, then go on with whatever kind of treatment/surgery you and your husband decide is right for you. It is ultimately your decision of course, but he will have to live with it too, so talk about it together. The benefit/risk ratio for back surgery is poor at best. A GOOD surgeon will tell you just what the chances are that you will have increased movement or decreased pain in your case. He will also be honest and tell you exactly what percentage of his patients with similar conditions actually do better after surgery, and what the risk of infections are in his patients. Ask him what he defines as success. Many studies define success as a 50% reduction in pain in 50% of the patients. That is not my idea of success. I would only have surgery for a functional improvement, not a decrease in pain. Write down your concerns and questions and write down the answers at your meeting, or have your husband do it for you. Do not schedule any surgery at the same appt. Go home and discuss things and think about things, perhaps have another appt. with the doctor you like the best if you have more questions. Then decide what to do. Remember that the hospital where you have the surgery is nearly as important as the surgeon you choose. Research their surgical infection rate and nurse/patient ratio. The fewer patients a nurse must care for, the lower the rate of surgical complications. Of course, you must also deal with your insurance company and which doctors and hospitals they cover. Surgery would be an absolute last choice for me. Take care, Annette"4239,primary care provider interactions,MRIs are really good at showing us structurally what is going on. What they do not say is why we have pain.4239,communication and learning about pain," A study done some time ago showed that some people have great MRIs and have lots of back pain, and others have terrible MRIs and no back pain at all. This study was one that had well over 700 participants and was quoted in multiple articles in professional magazines. I saw it quoted in a nursing magazine for RNs, and on Medscape for Internal Medicine Doctors, and in ""Arthritis Today"", a publication by the Arthritis Foundation. When the doctors in research come up with a test that shows why and where we have pain it will be VERY useful. This is why many people you discuss surgery with may have varying opinions about it. Even respected doctors may have different opinions about doing back surgery on the same patient.

"415,primary care provider interactions,"I have read here that some doctors want to see their new patients in maximum pain, so they ask them to not take their meds for one appt. I have never had a doctor like that. But I do know they have to document what they see. If you go to apply for disability later you want that pain noted in your medical records, and they cannot document what they have never actually seen. If he is planning on giving you injections, he would surely need to see you in pain to make a proper assessment, and know where to inject the drugs. I do know that often doctors want to make their own judgements on a patient, and purposely do not speak to other doctors on the case until after they see the patient and make their own diagnosis. Then they speak to the other doctors if they have any questions about the records or the patient. It seems he would want to verify your diagnosis, before he injects you with cortisone. Take care, Annette"894,pharmaceutical therapy,"Both only used it for acute pain, not for chronic pain, so that is a major difference both in how well it may work and with the possible adverse effects. Nausea and vomiting usually go away as side effects of opiates within a few weeks of regular use. Taking the right opiate orally before your pain gets bad enough to go to the ER for an injection is also important and usually possible once you figure it all out. Demerol is an old drug that is rarely used anymore because its metabolites may cause serious side effects, even seizures. Morphine is used in injection form in the ER and can also be taken by mouth at home if the Darvocet doesn<APO>t work, as can oxycodone. You won<APO>t know until you try them if they will cause side effects or not. I am kind of surprised that your first RX of darvocet was for 120 pills since you have so much difficulty with side effects. That is a lot of pills if you find after several doses that you cannot take it or it does not work. "894,communication and learning about pain,"I have read a couple of medical studies that used double blind randomised trials and showed that darvocet was no more effective than plain tylenol. My personal experience many years ago was the same, no more relief than I got from Tylenol. However, a good nurse friend of mine swears by darvocet and used it post op with good effect. She says it is better for her than vicodin. Another friend relates the same thing, she has used it for other kinds of pain in addition to post op pain.  My personal opinion really doesn<APO>t matter much. I would not use it again because it doesn<APO>t work for me, nor is it prescribed for the severity of pain I now have. I am glad that you are having a good experience with it so far. Take care, Annette"2530,communication and learning about pain,"I totally agree with you about labels. I am a person first, and I happen to have a few medical conditions also. I am also on SSDI, the SSA labeled me as disabled. I found that going through their process, they do not use a diagnosis to justify disability, they want to know how your diagnosis alters your ability to work for a living. I worked for years with DDD in my cervical spine as a nurse, that is not why I became disabled. Not even related. I was not self labeled with DDD, my doctors gave me that diagnosis. I did not even have pain from my neck, I had functional deficits in my hands, and later on some numbness. I don<APO>t think of myself as disabled other than that I cannot work for a living anymore, or at tax time, when they ask that dreaded question. I think a diagnosis is a ""label"" given by a MD to a patient. I think you and I agree on the real issue, perhaps not the words, I am not sure.

I have multiple other bulging discs in my neck, osteophytes, impingement on my spinal cord from the herniated disc. All that was from my last MRI over 15 years ago. I did have an MRI of my lumbar spine about 10 years ago, it is normal. As far as I know, there is no medical treatment that will prevent a bulging disc from herniating at a later date. "2826,exploring non pharmaceutical techniques for pain,"Hi, Laura Read all you can, but pay attention to who sponsors the sites where you read. My favorite site for good medical info about FMS is http://www.myalgia.com . It is not an interactive site like this one, but the articles are very good and reliable in my opinion. Dr. Robert Bennett, MD is a rheumatologist who works at the university medical center where I live. He has done a lot of research on FMS with his group. I have tried many things in the 15 years that I have had FMS. What works for me may not work for you as far as meds go. But I feel that exercise is absolutely necessary to keep your muscles in good condition. I use my very tiny hot tub EVERY day, it is the one thing I can count on to make my pain go away, at least for a little while. Vitamins and supplements are up to you, I wouldn<APO>t get carried away. Try one thing at a time so you can see if it is actually helping or not. Continue with what actually helps you. Then on to the next thing. This is also a good idea with meds, as you will know what side effects are from what medicine. I think it is important to find the meds that help you sleep, and control your pain the best so you can exercise properly. Your doctor should help you with that. Go slow with the meds, you have to give some of them several weeks to see if they help or not. Also for the side effects to go away, they often do if you wait it out for several weeks. You didn<APO>t mention how old you are, but that is important also. Keep in touch. Take care, Annette"2157,pharmaceutical therapy,"I have been taking methadone for about a year now, and have not had any of the side effects you mentioned. I am at a far lower dose though, that may make a difference. You have to start with a very low dose and work upwards very slowly to the best dose for you, often the doctor must finally decrease the dose at the very end of the titration process, as it builds up in your system due to the long half life. It is also very important to get a baseline EKG, and then get one yearly to monitor your heart. It can cause cardiac abnormalities in a very few people, but if you catch it, you just change drugs and it will go back to normal. I discussed it with a pain management specialist, even though my pcp manages my pain meds, just to be sure we had covered all our bases. I agree that no one should take any benzos (Xanax, ativan, valium, klonopin, etc.) along with any opiates. I believe it is a bad mix. I took a pain management class for healthcare professionals a year or two ago and the instructor said that the latest research said mixing opiates and benzos is a bad idea, and she said not to do it. She believed that soon doctors simply will not prescribe the two at the same time. I worked at a methadone clinic for addicts 40 years ago and we saw problems back then and asked our clients not to use benzos while they were on our methadone program. We also screened for them on the urine screens, just to be sure. All drugs have the potential to do harm, so you are absolutely correct in telling people to do their research, and be very careful. I do that for all drugs I take, not just pain meds. I am so glad you have resolved your problems and moved on to a different drug with a better side effect profile for you.

Take care, Annette"697,pharmaceutical therapy,"I<APO>m sorry but a total of 90 mg. a day is not that high a dose of morphine, at least not as far as I am concerned. When I switched over to my new drug I was taking 60 mg. of long acting morphine twice a day, plus BT meds. I would ask him about rotating to a different opiate if he feels that would be better than increasing the morphine. Perhaps that would help you. It sure did me, and I only changed for financial reasons, lol. I got better relief, and better function, too. There are no studies that I know of that have shown that any one narcotic is better than another as far as relief goes, or side effects. That said, I have known patients who just did better on one opiate than another for whatever reason. Usually I think it is due to the dosing, but it is also due to partial cross tolerance. I generally tolerate scores of 5-7 all the time and spikes of 8-10 occasionally, as long as I have access to treatments like my hot tub, TENS, Lidoderm patches, and BT meds in addition to my regular long acting opioid. Someone else may not be able to tolerate scores that high and still function, others can tolerate more pain than I can. Use this snowstorm while you are stuck inside anyway, and write down exactly what your goals are in the pain management area, and what your scores and activities have been like lately. I really believe in approaching doctors for more aggressive treatment of their pain by telling the doctor what they are, and are not, able to do at this point due to their pain interfering in their life. By approaching him with goals and function discussions rather than saying ""I am in terrible pain all the time"" I hope you will get better treatment from him. I would see him as soon as possible, call and make an extra appt. if possible. That lets a doctor know that the patient is really bothered by what is going on. If he is just an interventionist who was willing to give you meds for awhile to suck you into his practice, and he really wants to do this SCS surgery, and you don<APO>t have the money for it, you two may just be butting heads together and there may not be a real solution with this doctor.

I think you have been pretty good about doing all that already, but ask him if there is anything else you can do. If he says there is nothing more he can do for you, ask him to refer you to another PM doc who uses meds more than injections and procedures. Your appt. sheets that state your pain levels and levels of function should clearly show him that you are not progressing and need a treatment adjustment.

But, he WAS. He had little to no pain while in the hospital. They used two patient controlled pain med pumps, one had IV opiates in it, and the other went through a catheter into his hip, it contained a local anesthetic and numbed the nerves involved.

It is fine to use the internet to research a condition once you have been diagnosed, but it is very unwise to try and diagnose yourself based on what you read, or get someone else to diagnose you on line. After you get information online take it to your doctor and discuss it with him/her. Not all info you find on line is accurate or appropriate for your illness. I would suggest one use reliable medical sites for information, not sites that are trying to sell you stuff. I use evidence based medical research when it is available. Sites like Medscape have articles from peer reviewed medical journals. Take care, Annette"2615,exploring non pharmaceutical techniques for pain,"With your back and leg pain, you might not be the right person to be doing those things for your dad, even though you want to. Your own injuries may preclude you from being his caregiver. To find out, I would ask the doctor to send a home health care Occupational Therapist to your dad<APO>s home to see how you can do things easier. I was an RN in home health care for awhile and the OTs were great. They could break things down and teach folks to do them in such a way as to not cause further harm. Or ask your dad<APO>s doctor to get home health more involved in his care and the housekeeping. For instance, you said you are ""unable to stand to clean the wound"", why stand up? Nurses do things like that sitting when possible. This is just one thing you might learn how to do differently so as to cause you less pain.     "2615,pharmaceutical adverse effects,"There is only a partial cross tolerance, so if you switch over to too high a dose, you could die of an overdose, then where would your dad be? When I changed my drug dose or switched to a new medicine, I expected to see my doctor in person more often, once it was adjusted properly, I went back to less frequent appts."2615,pharmaceutical therapy,"That aside, and back to your pain meds. The starting out dose of a new pain med, when switching over from a different one, should be started very low, then adjusted upwards to cover the pain appropriately. My doctor and I went by my total daily dose of MS Contin (generic) per 24 hours. Sometimes I took it every 8 hours, sometimes I took it every 12 hours. She was happy to just double the total daily dose, but I wanted to increase it only by 50%. I wanted to then adjust the number of hours apart the doses were. She let me do it my way, after I explained it to her. Eight hours, twelve hours, both worked fine for me. Talk to your new doctor, but please do not compare him to his face with your old doctor. That is like comparing the new wife to the dead one, no one is ever happy with that comparison. Take care, Annette"780,primary care provider interactions,"Lots of discussions get off track from the initial post. Different people post different things and someone may decide to discuss something in a new post under an old thread. I don<APO>t have a problem with that. I feel in this case the ""books and dosage scales"" ARE important. People mentioned that they thought the dose was off and that she may be overdosing, that this was not even the correct drug to be using for chronic pain, etc. I took the time to look up the proper dosing for chronic pain and the percentage of people with specific side effects in a proper reference book. I feel that knowing the doctor was prescribing in the normal range of use for that medical problem would be reassuring. It does not mean that is the correct dose for that patient, that is up to the husband and the wife and the doctor to discuss personally and make whatever adjustment is necessary. The doctor can SEE the patient, and has access to much more information than we do. He also has the medical license. You say we need to ""always look at the patient"", of course this is true. However, we cannot see the patient, nor is she our patient. We are not even communicating with the patient, we are in communication with the husband of the patient. I feel when dealing with message boards, we need to have a bit more confidence in the patient and her husband communicating with HER doctor. Perhaps helping her to do that more effectively is the best thing we can do without ever even meeting her. We all share our own experiences, you made a point of saying you are an ICU nurse, that may make some folks think you are in some way more authoritative than someone else."780,social support for pain," I do not know if that is your intent or not. Is that not a part of your life experiences? WebMD has a specific place on their site where people do share their experiences with all kinds of different drugs, so apparently they do feel that kind of sharing is appropriate. Go to the different exchanges here, many posts are made up of folks telling each other how they reacted to specific drugs, good and bad. If you don<APO>t wish to share your own experiences with drugs and side effects, that is your choice. You and I do not get to decide when to ""have her checked out"" by a medical professional. That is properly up to the patient. I have every confidence that Cabriel<APO>s wife can make the appropriate decisions in her case.

My doctor<APO>s asst. called me back this am, and told me they billed the correct insurance company for the drug screen. She said they plan on doing the random screens about twice a year. I have been seeing the same doctor for about 12 years, and never, ever asked for early refills, lost drugs, etc. She always tells me if all her pain patients were like me, life would be so much easier.

My cousin and his sister<APO>s husband both died within three weeks of each other. I don<APO>t know how she manages, I would be a mess if I lost both my husband and one of my brothers in such a short time. We knew my cousin was going to die, he had been ill for quite awhile, but her husband died all of a sudden after being well and healthy for most of his life. Makes me realize how important it is for all of us to keep in touch with relatives and not put off until next year what we can do today.  I got held up while working in the ER once, a guy told me he had a gun and wanted the liquid cocaine in the eye cabinet. I talked him down and pushed the panic button that called the local police. I had him undressed, in a gown, and laying on a guerney, behind a curtain, by the time they arrived, guns drawn. They arrested him, but he had a hand laceration that our doctor needed to suture up first. My buddy had evacuated the ER of the rest of the patients while I had him behind a curtain. Great team work. The hospital had an incident debriefing meeting on the one day that month when I was working the night before and the night after the meeting, both 12 hour shifts. "61,pharmaceutical adverse effects,"It is correct medical practice to use about 50% of the equianalgesic dose when switching to a new opiate as the starting dose. This is because there is only a partial cross tolerance between opiates. If the patient has increased pain or what seem like withdrawal symptoms, she should be given breakthrough meds by the doctor to use as he adjusts the dose of the patch upwards slowly until she is doing well. There are also guidelines for patients to use when starting on the fentanyl patch when they are only on short acting opiates and have never used long acting opiates of any kind. I am sorry you have had such a terrible experience with doctors in regard to your pain meds. I have been very fortunate in having had great doctors. I ran into one ER doctor about 25 years ago when I went in with a migraine while visiting someone out of town. He was really rude, his ER nurse apologized for his behavior. He did give me an injection that worked just fine though. I wasn<APO>t on any opiates at that time. I marked it up to he was having a bad night.

Don<APO>t break any rules, or you could get booted out of his practice. "287,pharmaceutical therapy,"That said, Teresa mentioned several of the anti-depressants used for chronic pain management. The oldest one, amitriptyline, is often taken in the evening or at bedtime, and has a side effect of causing sleep. Something like that might be a good place to start, in that it may help your pain levels and help you sleep. The others she mentioned aren<APO>t as likely to help you sleep. Take care, Annette"3,pharmaceutical adverse effects,"I would discuss this with your pharmacist and doctor. Most people who are allergic to ""sulfa"" drugs, mistakenly say sulfur. There is no reason that I know of why someone who is allergic to sulfa drugs would not be able to be treated with the opiates. I looked up morphine and methadone and neither mention any cross sensitivity for folks with allergies to sulfa drugs. Nor does it mention sulfur allergy as a problem. I looked them up in a nursing drug handbook. Sulfur is a naturally occurring mineral, sulfa drugs are entirely synthetic. Take care, Annette"6,communication and learning about pain,"Ask your pharmacist to be sure if you are concerned. I have seem them prescribed together before. The flexeril may be causing the dry mouth, that is a common side effect. Tramadol can also cause a dry mouth, but not as often. Sugar free hard candies can help with the dry mouth.

I did have numbness along my neck for several years after the surgery, not total numbness, but partial with a definite change in feeling when I stroked my neck with my finger. It still feels a little different, I had my surgery in 1992. I had had difficulty with my right hand, and the herniation was pressing inward on my spinal cord, osteophytes were noted on my MRI. My hand function was normal immediately after the surgery. Unfortunately, six months after the surgery, I was rear-ended and herniated the disc above with the same outcome, pressure on the spinal cord. I have developed new osteophytes. This time I had no trouble with my hands so I opted to not have any further surgery. Take care, Annette"11,communication and learning about pain,"Ditto what Swank said. I am also concerned that she fell twice, once into a wall with her shoulder, and once 4 feet onto her hip.

She needs to see a doctor. Take care, Annette"12,exploring non pharmaceutical techniques for pain,"I<APO>ve had neither. I had one injection into a very painful spot that did work, but hurt really bad, nothing minor about that pain. It was worth it to me. The original pain has not come back at the original severity. That one shot also cost me $200 above what my insurance company paid. My question would be why increase pain, minor or not, if the injection is not likely going to work at all? The evidence of many injections and radio frequency ablation is pretty poor for relief. Your history of 20 injections and RFA that did not work, would point me away from these treatments if I were considering them. Good luck with your own quest for relief. Take care, Annette"14,primary care provider interactions,"Please go back and see your doctor again. If you have had this pain all along, tell him that. If the initial pain went away, came back, and this feels the same to you, tell him that. If this feels completely different, tell him that.

It can also happen in the daytime, not just at night. I started taking Ambien about ten years ago, and it helped me sleep better. When I started taking neurontin for FMS pain, that seemed to really help the RLS also. My husband said I wasn<APO>t moving around in bed as much, and I stopped wearing holes in the bottom sheets from kicking my feet. Some anti-Parkinson<APO>s drugs are also used for RLS. Sinemet comes to mind, but there are others also. Tell the rheumy again that it is keeping you from sleeping and ask if there is there anything he can do? If he feels like he doesn<APO>t know what to do, ask him for a referral to another doctor for help. Don<APO>t take nothing for an answer. Or you could ask your pcp if you feel he would be more helpful, but I would start with the rheumy myself. Take care, Annette"64,headache,"I would discuss this with a pharmacist who is well informed about these things. Opiates are not the best drugs for migraines anyway, can you take any of the migraine rescue drugs? I had terrible migraines four to five times a week at the worst. I stopped using opiates completely, and relied on other types of meds and found they really worked better. Opiates can cause rebound headaches if you take them more than 2-3 days per week. I was always glad I didn<APO>t develop those. Take care, Annette"89,pharmaceutical therapy,"I live in a state where there are laws on the books to protect medical marijuana users. They have to get a doctor to fill out a form and they pay a yearly fee, they then get a card from the state. As long as they do that, the state and local police will leave them alone. Of course, nothing protects them from the feds. I tried it years ago when we first moved here, both of my doctors at that time said it was okay in moderation if it worked. For me, it did not work at all, so I never bothered to apply for the card. I feel the same way about marijuana that I do about other pain management drugs. I feel it you are more functional on it than you are off of it, it is okay to use it in moderation. If all one did was lay around stoned all the time, I would not consider that more functional. You also have to consider your own body<APO>s toleration of smoking daily. As I see it, you have several options: keep it on the down low and live in fear of getting caught, work towards getting it legalized, or move elsewhere where there are at least local laws to protect you. You also need to decide whether or not to discuss this with your doctors as marijuana can interact with other drugs. You can feel them out first and see what their views are before actually telling them you are already using it. The last suggestion I have is to ask your doctors about prescribing Marinol for you. It is a pill that contains THC, the main ingredient of marijuana. If this works for you, it eliminates the illegal aspects of smoking pot, and the possible harm to your lungs of smoking it. Take care, Annette"153,primary care provider interactions,"From that reading of the MRI, it sounds like they are talking about the bone of the T12 vertebrae, since they said ""no bone edema to suggest acute injury"". That probably has nothing to do with any pain you are having now. See a neurologist or your own doctor to ask how any of this might relate to your present pain. It may well be none of it is relevant. Take care, Annette"184,policy and pharmaceuticals,"The DEA did not tell your doctor what he could and could not prescribe, your doctor decided not to deal with pain meds at all. That is his right, but don<APO>t blame it on the government. How can he manage his patients properly without ever using narcotics? I wouldn<APO>t go to him. Some illnesses require pain management, if only for a short time. The DEA does not make treatment decisions, individual doctors do. You say, ""They are removing the physician<APO>s right to choose the medication that would best treat their patient<APO>s pain."" I will ask you again, what drugs have the DEA said that doctors may not prescribe to their patients during this recent crackdown? Where can I find this information on the DEA website? I have read nothing about this in my nursing journals or on medical websites. The FDA is the agency that determines the safety of medication, they are the ones that pull unsafe drugs from the maket. The DEA deals with enforcement regarding mostly drug dealing and over-prescribing. My doctor has altered her practice somewhat so that she documents more completely those things she and the state feels are important to document for pain patients. I have been seeing her for about 12 years, now and she has updated her policies 3-4 times over the years as new information comes out. A few months ago, she asked all her chronic pain patients to sign updated pain medicine consent forms and pain contracts. She asked everyone on pain meds to get a ""recent"" consult with a pain management doctor to evaluate how our treatment was working for us. I hadn<APO>t had one in about 12 years, I don<APO>t think that was too much to ask of me. I went and saw a PM specialist and after one hour of talking about my history and treatment, he complimented me and my doctor, he said I was ""one of the best managed chronic pain patients he had ever seen."" So, now his report is in my file. The state of Oregon where I live, has specific chronic pain management guidelines, as long as the doctors practice within those guidelines and document their care, they do not get hassled by anyone. The DEA is a federal agency, and if they are ""cracking down"", it seems like they would do it where they find abuses. If your doctor was prescribing and documenting properly, he would have no trouble with them at all. If he is doing 2 minute, monthly appts. and handing out huge amounts of drugs without proper diagnosis and evaluation, then he deserves to be appraised by the DEA. I am a nurse, I am a pain management patient, and I just do not see a big DEA crackdown on doctors who manage pain appropriately. I do see some doctors using that as an excuse to not treat chronic pain. But, it is more likely that they just do not want to deal with figuring out who is a drug abuser after drugs to get high on, and who isn<APO>t. That takes an incredible amount of time out of your day, and drains your energy. I understand that, but I feel it is still a part of my doctor<APO>s job to treat my pain and help make me functional. Take care, Annette"1362,surgical,"I Googled it and it seems to be a minimally invasive surgery to remove disc material and decompress the spine. I think similar surgery is available in many places. they may use a different brand of endoscope. It seems the Accurascope is a brand name of the equipment used. I would not bother with this, surgery is surgery, and has a poor record of actually relieving spinal pain. I saw lots of testimonials but not research material that showed it actually worked, nor did I find lists of complication rates, infection rates, etc. To be honest, I did not spend a lot of time researching this, I just visited a few sites.

I found I will be exhausted no matter what, and I do feel better doing them. NO ONE gets to watch, lol. They are fun, and that is what matters to me. I cannot just ""exercise"", too boring. This actually distracts me from my pain and I have found they do not cause that much more pain than I already have. Last night I thought I would fall asleep while doing them, but I didn<APO>t, lol.

I have been through that part you mentioned about dreaming you were in horrible pain only to wake up and realize the pain was still there. It is terrifying. I was not working when I got that bad, but it did make me decide to try long acting pain meds, just during the night at first.. Does your nursing school allow students to use opiates while on the job at the hospital providing patient care? Some states allow nurses to use pain management drugs and others do not. I used short acting meds in the evening after work while I was still working because the state I lived in then did not allow nurses to use opiates on the job. Find out by calling your state nursing board, I have used mine for questions for years and they have always been wonderful. Your doctor may be assuming that if you are a nursing student, you cannot take long acting opiates, and he might be wrong. I am not defending him, because I suspect he isn<APO>t thinking that way, it is just a thought. I had one doctor that asked my nursing director right in front of me after emergency midline abdominal surgery how long she could spare me. I was barely awake from anesthesia. She said three weeks, and he released me to drive and work full time in three weeks. I wasn<APO>t allowed to move patients, and was told to ask other nurses to carry that part of my load until I could. He wasn<APO>t thinking of me, lol. I take neurontin too, but because I am also afraid of sedation, I take my entire daily dose all at once in the evening a few hours before bed. I consider it a wonder drug for me, it has helped me in many ways. My doctor suggested I take it that way and said she had other pain management patients who used it that way and they still had good pain contol during the day. I won<APO>t go to a doctor who is only interested in doing procedures and injections, because that is not what I want. You may have to find another doctor that fits in with your philosophy of how to manage your pain. Take care, Annette"127,policy and pharmaceuticals,"Call the company that makes your actiq and ask to speak to their consumer assistance program.

Take care, Annette"123,pharmaceutical adverse effects,"I would personally recommend an increase in the long acting med, Oxycontin, rather than the break through med. The literature I have read says one should only be using BT meds a couple of times a day, and if you need it more often than that, you should increase your long acting med. My personal experience is that over ten years I have only increased my breakthrough meds by 1/2 a Norco per dose. I started out taking one, now I take 1 1/2 per dose. As long as my long acting med dose is correct, the BT med gets my blood levels of opiates high enough to work when I need it. All doctors have their own way of prescribing opiates, and there is no ""one"" way to do it. I would just work within his comfort zone and be trustworthy. As long as you maintain a good relationship with your doctor, you should be able to experiment with your meds (with his permission of course) until you get the doses right."117,pharmaceutical therapy,"Any time I can help I am happy to, Charlie. Methadone was invented by the Germans during WWII because they could not get enough morphine for their troops. It was used for pain only until the 1960s or so, then it was utilized for heroin addiction. I was in nursing school in 1968 and was familiar with it mixed in a cocktail they gave cancer patients for pain. After I graduated in 1970, I worked in a heroin addiction clinic where we used it for treatment for those who wanted to try it. It was still considered experimental for that use at that time. I feel so comfortable with methadone that when my husband needed pain management for a bad hip, I had no trouble with his doctor putting him on methadone. He was on it for a couple of years until his other medical problem was healed and he could have the hip replacement surgery he needed. He was maintained on the methadone until after the surgery, then his doctor told us he could taper off whenever he wanted to. I fill his weekly medicine box with his meds, and my husband left it up to me to taper him off. He told me he didn<APO>t want to know about it. I told him fine, but he was to tell me if he felt sick at all. I tapered him off, he says he had no withdrawals at all. When I went on long acting meds my doctor and I were new to each other so I opted to go on long acting morphine because that was what she felt comfortable with. If we ever lose our private insurance, I will end up on Medicare and will switch to methadone. I hope it is working well for you"116,communication and learning about pain,"Benzos are drugs in the benzodiazepine family, things like valium, xanax, ativan, klonopin, restoril, etc. We were told way back then not to ever mix them with methadone when I worked in heroin addiction treatment in the 1970s. It seems like now they are finally telling the pain management world that it is still a bad idea. They mentioned it at a pain management class I took a year or so ago, and when I mentioned that here a lot of people got angry with me and thought I was wrong. Apparently they were taking opiates and benzos and didn<APO>t like me suggesting it wasn<APO>t a good idea"114,pharmaceutical therapy,"Substituting one opiate for another often reduces or eliminates withdrawal. If you develop any withdrawal symptoms, call your doctor and he can adjust the fentanyl or let you take percocet for breakthrough while you adjust to the patch."109,pharmaceutical therapy,"Teresa said many useful things. I want to really impress upon you the comment she made about ""chasing your tail"" with taking the pain meds after work and then waiting for them to get your pain levels down to something you can deal with. It has been shown in medical studies that people who take opiates when their pain level starts to go up, rather than waiting until the pain is terrible to take their pills, end up taking less medicine in the long run. Opiates work better when taken early on in the pain cycle. You should discuss with your doctor trying a long acting opiate, whether you try the fentanyl patch or one of the long acting pills doesn<APO>t really matter to me. By doing that you end up with a steadier level of medicine in your blood stream, and a steadier amount of pain relief. Many people also take a short acting med like your percocet for any breakthrough pain caused by increased activity, etc. Addiction happens in less than 5% of those who use opiates for pain. Be aware of this, but it is no reason to avoid opiates if you have no history of addiction problems in the past"107,pharmaceutical adverse effects ,Just the fact of using opiates does not mean one WILL become addicted. Less than 5% of people who use opiates as directed for chronic pain become addicts104,pharmaceutical therapy,"I wish there were a simple answer but there isn<APO>t. I would stick with one doctor who specializes in headache management, probably a neurologist. Then you just have to go through all the different meds, first one at a time, then in pairs. It can take 2-3 years to do this as you need to stay on a steady dose of each for 3-4 weeks at least to see if they will work. Narcotics are a poor choice for migraines or other types of headaches, as they can cause rebound headaches, which can lead to chronic daily headaches. Include the day your period starts and ends in your headache journal. It took me a really long time to learn to manage my migraines, but it was worth it when I finally came up with a treatment program that worked fairly well."98,pharmaceutical therapy,"Gail and I totally agree that using opiates for chronic pain is appropriate in most cases.

What kind of meds or other treatments a doctor offers is entirely up to him. I don<APO>t know what treatments would be best for you, that is between you and your doctor. I would suggest you choose one doctor and stick with him. Try whatever he offers, and if it doesn<APO>t work, tell him so. Then try the next thing he offers. As you build up a relationship with him he may learn to trust you enough to offer opiates if he feels they are warranted. "94,primary care provider interactions,"I just want everyone to know there is hope out there, there are good doctors around. My pcp manages my pain, and between the two of us we have done pretty well for the last 11 years or so. I had seen a PM doc just before I moved here so it had been awhile since I had been to one. She was updating her files and decided that all her pain patients should sign up to date opiate consents and pain med contracts. Part of that was that we needed to see a board certified pain specialist for a consultation if we had not seen one recently. My state medical board has guidelines for doctors who manage chronic pain with opiates, and they include a consultation with another doctor, and his agreement that opiates are the right way to go. As long as the doctors practice within these guidelines they are fine with the authorities. I asked my doctor for a referral to a PM doctor and she gave me one in my town. I checked out his website and he practices interventional pain management. I was very concerned that he would have an immediate bias towards doing injections and procedures and against using oral pain meds. I was so wrong to worry. He did a very thorough history, both the written one I filled out, and the one he did in our interview. We went through all the treatments and meds I had tried over the years, and I had tried more than he was used to. I have FMS, migraines, and DDD. I have had one discectomy in 1992. We spent about 50 minutes talking (he was even on time for my appt.). After our talk he told me I was possibly the best managed chronic pain patient he had ever seen, he congratulated me and my pcp. The only suggestion he made was that I do my stretches twice a day rather than once a day. Otherwise, I should just keep on with the treatment plan I had in place. He did not even suggest I have any invasive procedures. He commented on leaving that in his experience folks with FMS ended up in acute pain after the tender point exam and it was best done only to make a diagnosis. He felt there was no need to repeat it after that unless there was some kind of change in the patient<APO>s condition. He said since he would not be there to treat that pain, he would rather not instigate it. Hooray!! A caring doctor who understands FMS pain and does not want to make it worse. Seeing him was a really nice experience. So, they are out there. Keep looking if you have not found one yet."90,headache,"I assume the CT was of his head? If so that was the appropriate thing to do based on what I have learned over the years as an ER nurse. Two weeks is not long enough for him to give up yet. Many of the headache meds designed to prevent headaches take up to 4-6 weeks to work. Your hubby also need rescue meds to take when the headaches hit. I had a bump on the head in an auto accident once and had chronic daily headaches for about 8 weeks, then they went away. My doc called it post-concussive syndrome. It was miserable while I had it, and I was happy to see the end of it"88,communication and learning about pain,"I never had any trouble with w/c doctors until my husband fell off a truck onto concrete and developed a non-healing wound and AVN of the hip he landed on. They treated the wound until it finally healed after two years of wound care and two surgeries. But they claimed the hip problem was re-existing and refused to cover the hip replacement he required. All of his own doctors said the hip injury from the fall caused the AVN, but the w/c doctors all said it was pre-existing. He had NEVER had pain or any problems with that hip prior to the accident. The definition of pre-existing in our state says you must have medical documentation that it had been diagnosed and treated in the past. They opted to ignore that. It is the job of ""independent"" doctors who work for w/c to reject as many claims as they can. We gave up and used his employers insurance and paid out nearly $5,000 for our share of the cost, not counting time off work, etc. He had his hip replaced and is doing great. It is been one year post op now. This is one more reason I am for a single payer system of universal health care. We would eliminate w/c because all people would go through their own doctors for care and they would be paid out of one system. It has made me politically more radical than I was before"275,communication and learning about pain,"Chronic pain is different than migraines.

My level has dipped down this winter slightly below normal, and it has never been low before. I started taking supplements per my doctor, but have not noticed any difference with my pain. It was just as bad back when my Vit. D level was normal. Barometric changes can affect migraines and other kinds of chronic pain also.

If you don<APO>t feel any pain, how can the ""physical pain"" exhaust you and thereby cause you deep depression? Wouldn<APO>t any pain reliever cause depression using this logic? I understand how overdoing it can cause exhaustion, but I would just consider that you were much more active than usual and therefore more tired. I would use the amount of tiredness I feel to control the amount of activity I do, like regular, pain free people do. The neurontin was just doing what it was supposed to do, relieve the pain. Neurontin only causes depression in about 2% of the people who use it according to my drug handbook. That is a very small percentage.

They do not know anything about you or your medical history. I also have FMS and it very much complicates any medical history of chronic pain. Surgery could help, or could actually make your pain worse. Your BF (and you) should have thought about the stresses of a toddler before you had a baby together. I have not heard of any kind of help with normal toddlers while their mom has surgery. Check with your county (phone 211) about respite care if your child is not entirely healthy. From my point of view, your pain med doses ARE fairly high, certainly are not considered low. But it is an individual thing. We are all different. I take methadone 10 mg. three times a day, and oxycodone 20 mg. as needed for breakthrough pain, (usually twice a day). That is all the opioid-type medicine I take, and I have been taking opioids of some sort daily since 1995 or so. Is your Opana a long acting drug that you take on a schedule, or do you only take it as needed for break-though pain? Trust me, I have been in your shoes with a husband and a toddler, I discovered when we split up that I was taking care of two kids, not one. Money was a little tighter, but life was a lot better after he moved out. It was fairly easy except for the childcare.

How long does it take to ""wake up"" your hand in the AM when you get up? I have known people with carpal tunnel syndrome that never had any surgery at all, and others that did. It is not an emergency, talk to more MDs and get all your questions answered. I had weakness in my dominant hand that got worse and worse, I had a surgery in my cervical spine that fixed it, but six months later, I herniated the disc below that one.

There is a rapid detox done under general anesthesia that can be done as a day procedure, but it costs a lot and is usually not covered by insurance. I am not aware of any other kind of detox that would not entail going through withdrawal. Of course, the withdrawal symptoms can be treated with other medications so they are managable.

He hurt his back and ended up with chronic back pain. He finally had surgery with success as far as pain relief went. After all of this was done and over, he and I were talking one night, he said he had lost all compassion for chronic pain patients as he had been one and if he managed to cover his work shifts, so should they. He felt they were a bunch of whiners. Fortunately, this was not conveyed to patients, he continued to treat them well. It is all in the personal attitude and how you behave and act throughout your life. Take care, Annette"1077,pharmaceutical therapy,"Did she ever get regular bowel movements? If not, being constipated really hurts, you get abdominal pain from being all backed up with fecal matter. It can also cause vomiting and nausea. I totally understand the comment the doctor made about an antibiotic not working on people in your area. It is NOT a racist comment. This has to do with antibiotic resistance. When people in a certain community have infections and are all treated with the same antibiotic, the bacteria become resistant to that antibiotic, and often a different antibiotic becomes necessary. I worked in a free clinic and the doctors had access to information about antibiotic resistance in different communities. Because we did not have access to a lab to do cultures like the folks with insurance do, the doctors would often rely on that kind of information to decide what antibiotic to use for different kinds of infections. It is far better to have a culture and sensitivity done on all patients that present with a UTI (or any other type infection) based on a urine dip stick test that just shows the presence of blood cells and proteins and such. With a culture and sensitivity the doctor knows within 24 hours if the patient was given the correct antibiotic, and if not they call you on the phone and tell you so you can go get the best RX for that infection. It is very important that she take every pill until they are all gone, do not stop them unless a doctor tell you to. Did any of the places she went to do a culture and sensitivity to determine which antibiotic is best for that infection? You do have to fight for her care, that is unfortunate, but true. So far, based on what the doctors found, she is very constipated and had/has a bladder infection. So the main things so far are, has she had reasonably decent bowel movements daily or every other day? And has the bladder infection resolved? The best way to tell that is to have a urinalysis about a week after she finished her antibiotics. It should show clear by then. I know it is hard to get her in to a regular PCP but keep trying, it will be worth it in the end. Someone who knows her and has her medical records at hand will be the best person to care for her. Take care, Annette"4637,pharmaceutical adverse effects,"I had no problems switching from MS Contin, generic of course, to methadone. The doctor does the calculations with the help of an online tool for just that. Then he should start you low and you very slowly titrate the dose upwards until it works for you. Methadone is a bit tricky, it works differently than other opioids. Don<APO>t mess with the dose on your own. I think I started at 5 mgs. twice a day and ended up on 10 mg. three times a day. I would start having pain again hours before the next methadone dose war due, so she changed it to every 8 hours instead of every 12 hours. The main thing is start low and work your way very slowly until you have good pain control. I still take 20 mg. of oxycodone for breakthrough pain.

And that inspectors found at least one sealed vial contaminated with fungus. They are still doing tests of course. They feel that up to 13,000 people got steroid injections in their spine or other joints. The sad news is that they were not only used on spines which could cause spinal meningitis, but also they were used on joints like knees and shoulders.

Take care, Annette"5060,primary care provider interactions,"A PCP is your primary care physician, so a specialist is not usually a PCP. I would find either a family practice doctor or an internist. He can refer you to a pain management specialist if necessary. Occasionally a GYN acts as the PCP for some women. If your pain is related partly to pelvic adhesions, have you asked a GYN for her opinion? I would never ask if the PCP prescribes opiates for chronic pain when I schedule the first appt. They always say no so that the drug abusers don<APO>t come flocking to their doors. I wait until I go for the initial appt, then I explain what meds I take and why and all that. I always tell them that I am prepared to wait until they get to know me and feel comfortable with me before they choose to prescribe opiates. Every doctor I have ever been to has offered by about the third appt. to write for my pain meds. Trust goes both ways, they have to be able to trust that you will take your meds properly and not sell them like your acquaintance does. They also need to make their own decision about what meds are necessary. Since you have already been off of them for two weeks, you have been through 99% of any withdrawal you are going to have, and your tolerance level has reset to that of someone who never took opiates at all. Because of this, you may require far less than you did when you stopped taking them. That is the silver lining of this dark cloud for you. Good luck in your quest.

The side effects for me were a drunk feeling the first few hours after I took it. I take my total daily dose a few hours before bedtime all at once, instead of divided doses. That side effect went away after a few weeks at a steady dose. I tried Lyrica when it first came out, it was much more expensive, although my insurance covers it. I did have to pay a higher co-pay because it was not available in generic, and did not do any better than the neurontin, so back I went. I truly believe that the chemical difference is so slight that it really is not worthwhile to take the more expensive newer drug in this case, but that is just my opinion. I looked in my drug book for nurses and the side effect of twitching and a change in muscle coordination happens in only 1-2% of users. My nocturnal myoclonus actually was much decreased when I started taking this med for pain management. I used to kick holes in my bottom sheet at night, but not anymore.

My husband had a hip replaced several years ago, his gait also changed, and he got used to walking kind of hunched over before the surgery. The hip surgery is generally easier to get over than knee surgery. Your husband may always have some kind of pain in his knee, but the best thing, I feel, is to see a good doctor or two or three before any new surgery. He may have already done this.

He had told me that he withdrew from opiates when he had cancer before I knew him, and had no withdrawals. I really did not believe him, but this time I was there and he had NO withdrawals either time. I tapered him down and off myself. He had surgery and his pain was relieved one time, and he just wanted off of opiates the other time. I cut my methadone dose in half after I had breast reduction surgery and had no withdrawals at all. No increase in pain either. I had terrible withdrawal symptoms from benzos about 13 years ago.

The only blood test I have had for opioids was to check to see if the amount in my blood stream correlated with the amount I was taking. It is my understanding that the therapeutic amount of opioids is the amount that relieves your pain without causing side effects that would preclude you from taking it. Because of tolerance that amount may change from person to person and from one time to another for the same person. 180 mg. of methadone a day is high enough to be concerned about cardiac arrythmias, these can happen any time during treatment, so I would can understand your PM doc being concerned and would discuss with him how often to get the EKGs done. Were you getting good pain relief from the 180 mg. per day of methadone?

Look on the label if it has APAP on it with oxycodone, then discuss this with your husband and his doctor. It should not take the doctor a year to wean him off of any meds he is still on. He may not choose to take him off of all the meds, that would depend on your husband and the recommendation of the addictions specialists too.

Take care, Annette"4434,policy and pharmaceuticals,"I tried to look these two drugs up in my drug books and on line and found a different spelling for Hycosamine, but it was the same drug I thought it was, an antispasmodic. I used to take it for urinary tract spasms. Dicyclomine is also known as Bentyl, an antismasmodic that is usually used for GI problems. It works on the involuntary muscles of the GI system, not the skeletal muscles. Hyoscyamine (closest spelling I could find) is otherwise known as Levbid, is also an antispasmodic commonly used for GI and urinary tract muscle spasms, both involuntary muscles, not skeletal muscles. I didn<APO>t find anything under the spelling you gave me, so I am not certain this is the same drug you mentioned. Antispasmodics are generally for the involuntary muscles of the GI and urinary tract.The doctor may have told you they relax the muscles of the GI system, different words for the same things. Muscle RELAXANTS generally refer to things like flexeril, Zanaflex, etc., they are for the skeletal muscles and do not affect the GI or urinary tract or the muscles that help make them work. This is the way I have learned about them in nursing school and since in general use in nursing. These two drugs are useful for the kind of GI problem that you mentioned. The muscles relaxants like flexeril and Zanaflex are the muscle relaxants usually used for skeletal muscles spasms like you would find in back pain, but would not be useful for GI pain and muscle spasms. Antispasmodics and muscle relaxants are two different kinds of drugs. I may have misunderstood what you were saying, because I think of these two drugs as antispasmodics, not muscle relaxants, which are a different class of drugs entirely, according to what I have learned. In different geographic areas, doctors use different terms to describe various medical things, including medical equipment and drugs.

My internal medicine doctor said to take prenatal vitamins for hair thinning, she had read some medical studies about it working, and had a few patients that felt positively about it.

Some people can manage their pain with no drugs at all, some use non-opiate drugs, some use whatever works. What is really the moral difference between using a non-opiate and an opiate drug? Chronic pain is often part of a non-curable condition, what right do I have to judge what another person chooses to do for the rest of their life? I have chosen not to use opiates at one certain stage in my life, now I opt to use them, that may change again before I finally die, I am only 60 years old.

Some pain management doctors have associates that manage addiction in patients who need it, and it sounds like that might be helpful for you. I don<APO>t know if your new pain management doctor does that or not, you will have to see when you talk to him. You may need to detox off of the heroin just to find out what your pain levels are now that you got your clavicle fixed. Then you and your doctor can assess the pain you do have and decide how best to handle it. Opiates may not be the answer for you at this time. There may be other treatments that work better for you.

(You also changed to the new clinic.) His new group practice may have specific rules about prescribing scheduled drugs for non-cancer chronic pain. My doctor originally was with a clinic down the street from where I live. She was the only doctor in that group who would prescribe opiates to chronic pain patients, she asked us all to please not request refills or RXs from the other doctors in her group. Their philosophy was so different that eventually she left and went into private practice. I followed her to her new place. She just joined another group this year, and I followed her again. She has been my pcp for over 15 years now. I really like her a lot. We fit well together. So far so good. I have only been to the new place once so far. I know that group practices (clinics) often have internal rules about some things. Perhaps pain meds is one at your doctor<APO>s new clinic.

For various reasons we found a dearth of good head to head studies of pain meds. We used a data base of evidence based studies done in English, and found very few good ones. We did the best we could, and commented in our report that much more study was needed. I totally agree that medicine is an art as well as a science. I have discovered while working as a nurse, that geography seemed to have a fair amount of effect on clinical practice. Some drugs were not used at all in one state, others were used instead.

If you have been taking the vicodin daily for at least a week, your doctor might try you on a low dose fentanyl patch and see if that is better at controlling this pain.

My husband has tapered off of methadone twice in the last twenty years in a matter of weeks with no withdrawals at all. NONE. He also tapered off of morphine and also oxycodone without any trouble. He has the right biology for opioids, I guess, lol. I am currently on methadone and have been for nearly two years. I reduced it by half over three weeks last January (after surgery which reduced my pain) with no withdrawals at all. I expect if I went off of it altogether, I would have increased pain as my untreated pain came back full force. I expect I will have to gradually increase it over time as I develop tolerance to it. I have been on opioids for fifteen years now so I know how my body responds to them.

Take care, Annette"849,pharmaceutical therapy,"I have found that the way to measure your pain med needs is to add up everything you take in a 24 hour period, that would be your total daily dose. I think your doctor<APO>s suggestion of trying half a pill every two hours rather than one at a time over a longer time span might help you. I had a patient once who did her pain meds that way and it worked much better for her. She actually started taking her meds broken in quarters every hour instead of one whole pill every four hours. All you can do is try it and see how it works for you. Meds like BT meds that are written to be taken every four hours ""as needed for pain"", are not meant to be taken that way 24/7, the doctor expects you to have times on your long acting meds where you do not need to take the BT meds. If you still have pain 24 hours a day, your long acting meds probably need an increase in dose. Discuss this with your doctor. I agree with your doctor about seeing a shrink for the emotional problem related to your chronic pain, or any other reason also. They are specialists in their field, and are familiar with the required meds and therpies used for anxiety and depression. If you had a brain tumor you would see a neurologist, why not a shrink for anxiety and depression? Take care, Annette"5280,pharmaceutical therapy,"I am sure Charles will also respond, but here is my experience. I find the long acting opiates do work for 12 hours for me, but some people prefer to take them every 8 hours. I don<APO>t think you should ""feel them"" start to work. If you are on the correct dose, you should just feel better and use the breakthrough meds less. I think 2-3 days on a new dose is long enough to know if the dose is working well for you. If it isn<APO>t, just go see the doctor and explain to him just how you are taking them and what your pain levels are. It may help to keep a journal for awhile. I approach my doctor with whatever decrease in function I may have in response to the pain, rather than just saying I have more pain than I want to have. Most references I have read suggest one should only need 1-2 breakthrough doses per day, but that depends on how you and your doctor wish to do it. I would expect to have more frequent appts with the doctor while sorting this out. If he prefers you deal with him over the phone about meds, you can do that. I just personally think it is a lousy way to handle med increases.

I think it is always wise to use many different things for pain relief. Take care, Annette"964,primary care provider interactions,"Lisa, Let us know how the EMG goes on Thursday. I had one that didn<APO>t hurt at all, and one that did hurt some. The results were the same though. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette"459,pharmaceutical therapy,"Where can I find medical research that shows any kind of opioid withdrawal that lasts for many years afterward? What site do you use on line that has the drug precautions highlighted in red? I use a drug handbook for advanced practice nursing. I like it because it breaks down side effects on many of the drugs into the percentage of user who has them.

Take care, Annette"618,pharmaceutical adverse effects ,"If any person is using any opioid in any other way than the doctor prescribed it, it is abnormal. Doctors do not normally prescribe methadone to be taken IV at home. If this person has oral tablets and is crushing them and dissolving them to shoot up in their veins, they are drug abusers. If they are taking drugs not prescribed to them, they are drug abusers. If they have IV vials of methadone and it is prescribed to them, and they are using it according to the RX, then they are doing what their doctors said to do. If you have any concerns, call their doctor and explain to him what you have seen and let him deal with it. Call 911 if you have any concerns about the safety of the person you are talking about. Take care, Annette"2935,headache,"If taking the birth control Pill decreases your migraines, except during the week that you take the dummy pills, the doctor can prescribe them for you to take the active pills every day and only stop to let yourself bleed once every three months, or whatever length of time the two of you agree on. This can prevent a lot of migraines over the course of a year. Take care, Annette"4884,primary care provider interactions,"I would opt for a pain management specialist that does more than just interventions or considers himself an interventionist. Be sure you have a specialist who uses daily drugs as well as procedures, injections, etc. I have found cognitive behavioral therapy to be very useful, in addition to my medications. Just remember we all different and what works for me may not work well for you. Take care, Annette"2073,exploring non pharmaceutical techniques for pain,"I am aware of this drug. I am glad you are having positive results with it. I wait at least five years after a drug has been approved by the FDA, that is when you see what kinds of side effects it actually causes when used long term. The long term safety studies are only one year long for most drugs, and we may be taking them for a lifetime. I think Savella is related to antidepressants and works on the serotonin and norepinepherine neurotransmitters (If I remember correctly). I have tried many of these types of drugs and they did not work out well for me. I will wait and see what the results are of lots of people taking this drug. Take care, Annette"4685,pharmaceutical therapy,"I think it is a geographic thing, but I know that it was rarely, if ever, given at the last ER I worked in in Nevada. I worked there for nine years as an RN and can easily count on one hand the number of times I gave it. I am so glad you did not need to go anywhere and could treat it at home. Take care, Annette"4685,pharmaceutical adverse effects,"Demerol should not be used much anymore. It can cause toxicity and seizures, even a single dose. "5107,pharmaceutical therapy,"This is a question that he needs to ask his doctor or pharmacist. I was on coumadin for six months and managing pain became the most difficult part of using this drug. I had depended on NSAIDs for years for pain and could no longer use them. I also could not use quite a number of herbals and supplements. Take care, Annette"5215,primary care provider interactions,"Laminae are bony arches on the vertebrae of the spine. A laminectomy removes this bony arch to relieve pressure on the spinal cord. The pressure may be caused by trauma, or by degeneration of the adjoining disk. If several laminae are removed the vertebrae must be stabilized with a fusion of some sort. Scar tissue is generally referred to as fibrosis, as Crazytexan mentioned. Scar tissue can grow and also apply pressure to the spinal nerves or spinal cord, so you have to be very careful about what kind of surgery you plan. Take care, Annette"2421,primary care provider interactions,"I assume you saw your pcp or some kind of MD when you were injured the first time, and again this time???I would make an appt. and go back and see him/her again. They have found recently that multiple concussions in young people can cause serious problems as life goes on. Please do not self-diagnose or self-treat. A sports trainer or coach does not substitute for an MD. Take care, Annette"3054,primary care provider interactions,"I am sorry, I can only guess what you mean in your posts as you have not made it into sentences or use punctuation. I assume you have had a number of spinal surgeries, and are now using Opana for pain and it is not working. You also have bipolar disorder, and feel very depressed. If you are on a lot of mental health meds, still depressed, and also in pain and the Opana is not working for you, I am not sure you are even capable of giving informed consent for surgery at this time. If I were you, or if you were my friend/family, I would suggest you see your psychiatrist first and get your bipolar disorder under better control, then see the PM doctor and get your pain under better control. Once you are past this crisis you can decide about more spinal surgery. I think it is more a matter of what dose you use for the Opana than using a ""stronger"" pain med. The PM doctor may be reluctant to give you more because you are taking Ativan or other mental health meds. I don<APO>t know, ask him directly why he feels it is not the time to increase your dose or change the type of pain meds you take. Take a deep breath, and try and settle yourself a bit. Take care, Annette"2266,exploring non pharmaceutical techniques for pain,"I think that doctors call them ""growing pains"" when they don<APO>t have any other diagnosis. Often the kids out grow them, sometimes the doctors do find other diagnoses. All four of my siblings and I had them, my son and my nephew both had them, we all grew out of them without ever being diagnosed with anything else. They just gradually went away. My nephew was the most seriously affected, he would wake up screaming, like you describe. If there is nothing to do to prevent Osgood-Schlatter, if your grandchild does show signs, then I would rub her legs, give her a warm bath and whatever else your family usually does. I am unaware of any treatments to do to prevent any problems from occurring. Take care, Annette"3696,communication and learning about pain,"Forget the old saying about ""no pain, no gain"", just find your new normal. Acute pain is usually a warning of something wrong in your body. Chronic pain is something else altogether, do not let it come to that. Talk to your surgeon, do what he says to do. My old PM doctor, a former neurosurgeon, and currently a pain management specialist said to always exercise, but in small increments, working slowly up to the best you can do. He said when pain went up, to go back on exercise, but keep it up. Take care, Annette"4743,exploring non pharmaceutical techniques for pain,"Sorry, I wasn<APO>t clear I meant ""My"" as in mine. Lidoderm Patches work for me for some kinds of chronic pain that is way beneath the surface, but when I take the patch off, my skin is not numb. Ask the doctor for a sample if he thinks it is worth trying. They are very pricey, but I cut them up in pieces, like the doctor told me to do. I do not use them for injections as I do not have shots often enough. I guess I would ask as a nurse/mom which is worse, the injections or the allergies, then go from there. Take care, Annette"

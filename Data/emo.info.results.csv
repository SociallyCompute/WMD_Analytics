fibromyalgia_exchange,17149_0,"Good Morning MiMi, Sounds to me like yesterday was not only a busy day but a very happy one. I hope you don<APO>t have a <APO>pay back<APO> day today. I really do <APO>over due<APO> on the good days, but even when I have to rest the next day, I wouldn<APO>t trade the chance to <APO>over due<APO> the chance i get. So keep on doing.

It<APO>s the cold of Fall and Winter that I just hate so much. :-D So after the football game I have projects to get done and the nice warmth of the day will just cheer me on. :) MiMi, while I have your ear I<APO>d like to ask a question about Vit D. I had my yearly Vit D refilled last week ( it got here by mail yesterday.) by Medco, GM<APO>s retirement Pharmacy, :-p and was surprised to see they sent me, not the small powdered pills I usually get, but these little blue pills that were liquid. I have been getting my Vit D 50,000 pills in powder form directly from the Dr.<APO> office since day one, but with the new Rheumy from Vanderbilt, sent the script away for the Vit. D. I didn<APO>t think there<APO>s be any difference in the Vit D but now I get this liquid form in 50,000 :- So it<APO>s got me thinking if what I got was as good as or not as good as what I have been using the past year. :-, I have heard liquid Vit D is beyond better than powder so am thinking Medco, is doing me a favor. Not believing it though, they haven<APO>t so far, but you just never know. So, You being the Board<APO>s resident expert on all things Vit D I thought I<APO>d ask you if you think it<APO>s better than, the same as, as not as good as the powder D. Knowing Medco, I<APO>m guessing I<APO>m getting less for more.:( Thanks for any input and keeping have busy and productive days. Soft hugs going out to you, :) Linda R.",3.6,2.6,C

I sorta understand their thinking, in that we use distraction as a tool to decrease our pain then come here and talk about it (according to them, not me). But I beleive we share a whole lot more than ""I feel terrible, life is terrible and everything is wrong"". We share a journey of learning, accepting and living our lives the best we can with FM.

I say that because I ended up with one on my left wrist....and it had to be removed....the surgeon ended up and had to graft some bone to fill the space which was left....I had carpal tunnel surgery and he fixed the cyst too....it ended up being a lot more complex than he had expected it to be. I ended up being in a full cast for over 9 weeks....and I had pins holding my wrist together....it was NOT a fun time. I do agree....we, FMers, always deal with one thing or yet something else. It seems like it is a vicious cycle. Talking about ear infections....the doctor told my GD that she could go swimming even though she had the ear infection and was on medicine. The doctor said though that she did not need to get overly tired....REALLY? Now I raised 3 children and I do not remember being told that it was ok for them to swim when they were sick. I guess times have really changed....in more ways than one. Cory, I do hope you can try to pace at work....as I wonder just sometimes how you do all that you do. Dealing with FM is quite stressful just by itself....so I have no idea just how you continue to work and then come home and continue to do other things as well. I hope things get better for you. But you should also remember that it is left up to you to take care of yourself. Take care and I hope the weather will soon be nice.

I was trying to break up a dog fight while I was walking a dog. I did go to the emergency walk in clinic, they cleaned it etc. the next morning I went back to the clinic, as the bandage had come off and it was a hard one to rebandage. they did some more tests, and told me to get to the hospital immediately, they were going to call ahead and tell them. I had to stay in the hospital for 3 days had some nerve damage that I had to to a specialis so I could get surgery for, along with therapy. This really wasn<APO>t that big deal of a bite.

fibromyalgia_exchange,23546_6,"Hello Rachg and welcome....MiMi in NC....So sorry that you are dealing with so much right now....you were asking about Vitamins....I am one of the FMers here who has learned how to *control my FM pain* by taking vitamins and supplements and doing other things as well...only after trying different medicines but not finding anything which really helped me cope better without getting other side effects. You will have to do your own trial and error process...since what works for one person may or may not work for you...we are all different and only you can decide what works for you. It took me a long time to figure out what exactly I needed....I did a lot of research myself...and then tried different things...I take the following: Fibro Response (found at a vitamin store) or Magnesium Malate (vitamin store)...Omegas, multi vitamin with extra D...(I take Source One 50 found at walmart)...Calcium and Super B Complex...these are the ones which help my FM pain the most...I also take others as well since I do have other issues to deal with. You should try to take them around the same time each and every day....I have found that keeping a schedule is good for me...I also drink plenty of water..(actually this is all I do drink)...watch what I eat...I do gentle stretches and/or exercises...(Gentle being the key word here)..if you are having problems with sleeping...you should also try taking a hot shower right before bedtime using lavender bath salts which help the body to relax so that you can rest better...Getting enough sleep is so very important to me... I also use a heating pad as needed and Stopain Spray as needed (found at walmart). You should also be sure and pace, pace and pace even more...with anything and everything you do....allow yourself to do things as you can...and allow your body to rest...we, FMers, can not push ourselves to the limit, like most of us were use to doing...if you learn not to *cross the line*...you will feel so much better. Sometimes we have to pick and choose what to do..and learn to say NO...we can not do that right now. Physical therapy might be ok....as long as you let them know you have FM...again....start out slow in whatever you do. You should allow at least 6-8 weeks of whatever you decide to try before making a decision as to whether what you are doing is really helping you, unless, of course, it is making you worse. A lot of us FMers have multiple health issues...and I will tell you that IF you have other health issues that any and all of them will have to be addressed before you will begin to feel better...(I learned this from my own personal experience). A lot of doctors do not understand FM and how to treat it...some doctors do not even believe that FM is a real illness....shame on them for not keeping up with what is going on with people these days. I am sure that FM is real....I tried in the beginning to ignor it...thinking that if I did, it would just disappear....it didn<APO>t....some doctors think it is all in our head....well, part of this is correct...it has a lot to do with our brain and the nerves as well. I do hope that you have gotten your Vitamin D level checked....if not....please ASK your doctor to do this...low Vitamin D can cause additional pain for some people and it can also affect other illnesses as well....you can do your own research on this....you might be quite surprised at just how much the medical researchers have discovered about Vitamin D and just how important it is to everyone. OK...I know this is long...I hope I have helped you in some way here. Hang in here with us....post often, ask questions...make comments and/or suggestions. We understand how you feel...we have been there and done that. Things will get better....with time....trust me...there is something out there that will help you cope better. Take care and good luck.

All sorts of strange and weird thoughts about what *it* might be....and I was not getting any help from the doctor.....I tried several different medicines for a while with no relief. So I finally decided that IF I just *forgot* about the illness that perhaps it would *go away* (I was hoping beyond hope)....but I did think that perhaps this would happen. Nothing was working to help it so perhaps it was truly nothing for me to even worry about. That did not work though. And years have passed and I am still trying to cope better with it.

Nana B said that you have to figure out a way to *dance with the dragon, instead of draggin the dragon*.....and OMG....how very true.

I have no choice but to get out of bed or off the chair/couch to stand up and snap my feet back into place. I get those in the back of my upper thigh as well. They hurt. I have had them in my forearm after i over exert them from sweeping or mopping floors. I actually get a bulge in the muscle just in front of my wrist and it will last for a couple of days.

fibromyalgia_exchange,872_11,"Just an FYI since there has been some discussion on this, in Ohio, fibro is not considered a disabling condition. However, I was approved on depression related to a physical illness. What made me laugh was I sent in STACKS of paperwork on the fibro, blood clotting disorders, glaucoma and history of DVT-PE<APO>s but they handpicked out of there the depression, which was at that time considered mild, and approved me. So, who knows... all the states are somewhat different, but I was just happy in the end to have some relief. I<APO>d MUCH rather be working, but the reality is I can<APO>t. So I<APO>m grateful everyday for this! Good luck to everyone working on the disability right now, I know how tough it can be! Aimee",3.3,3.6,F

fibromyalgia_exchange,6167_4,"Hello CrystalRiver........MiMi in NC.....so good to ""see"" you again.......I had wondered how you were doing.....sorry you are not feeling ok.....Can you not find you another doctor.....perhaps call around and see if you can find one how actually believes in FM? I am so sorry that you are having issues..... Did you have a MRI done or why did they think you had neck problems? A lot of us have multiple health issues and I think that is sometimes the reason doctors have such a problem trying to figure out what is going on with us.....we have too much going on....I say this because my doctor pointed depression to me for everything.....and then I did my own research....and figured out I had parathyroid problems....so we started with this.....I had 14 out of 18 symptoms of it...and my doctor still believed it was depression....so needless to say, I had to get ugly.....but I did succeed to get myself some help... In fact, I was seriously thinking about going to Tampa if my doctor was not willing to do the scan on me......I gave him no choice....I told him that I wanted him to PROVE to me that I did not have parathyroid problems....so he gave in and ordered the scan for me.....and then he had the nurse to call me to tell me he was making me an appointment with a surgeon.....the scan pointed to problems...now this started yet another problem....the surgeon reviewed my medical records and thought I did not need surgery.....that all of my issues were due to low Vitamin D.....I was pleased with this at all, although I did learn a lot from this surgeon....when he told me that I did not need surgery....I told him that I needed help and if he could just point me in some direction to get the help I needed.....so then he told me that ""sometimes"" even the scan does not tell doctors what they need to know....he decided to do an ultrasound on me right there in the office.... This ultrasound showed him what he needed to see....and I did have problems...which required having surgery....and according to the surgeon....it was worse than it was shown in any of the test... so I share this with you....to let you know....that doctors do not always know what is going on with us....and if you have not gotten any relief......it is time to find another doctor.... I also ended up having cervical (neck) surgery too.....my right arm go to where I was in so much pain that I could not use it at all.....could not wash my hair or brush my teeth without extreme pain... So I will say this.....if you are having ""neck"" issues.....I would definitely get another opinion.... And when I went to see my doctor about this problem....he did not waste any time telling me that I was depressed again.....and he has since decided that I know my body better than he does....and he sent me right away for tests.... I do not quite understand why doctors think that women are just ""depressed"" and I think they do not take our complaints seriously.....and this is not right.... I can not even imagine why doctors think that we just imagine we have pain.....I say that if you are having pain and can not get any relief......there is something wrong.... At one time.....I truly thought that I was going to die before any doctor was going to find out what was wrong with me and get me some relief.....but I still did not give up......so I also think you need to keep on keeping on until you find someone who will listen to you.... I do not know what you have tried.....but I have tried a lot of different medicines but did not find anything that would help me without a lot of other side effects....and I did not need anything else to deal with.....so I now take vitamins and supplements and I have learned how to ""control"" my pain....I take a magnesium and malate combination supplement, Omegas, and Vitamin D and Calcium.... plus others....but these are the ones that I think help me the most... Good luck and take care.. MiMi",4.5,5.2,F

fibromyalgia_exchange,25723_2,"Oh perseverance,(great name) that is a key with this mess. 2 steps forward and one step back....you will get to the end in time! I came here in 2003, but this started way before I just didn<APO>t know. In 2003 I met my champion MD (neurology) and she knew everything I said, and understood all my issues...I cried. I bought her medical book she pointed to each time she explained something to me. I also got my first trigger point injection session. OMG. Not for the faint in heart. BUT it showed my huband (DH) dear husband, where my issues were...everywhere* and it was REAL to him for the first time. He then became my champion with my son<APO>s and the family who just didn<APO>t understand me. Life got better. I was told I couldn<APO>t do this moving forward without a support group and I stumbled here. Oh man, what a gang of people I found. Those that were here then are now gone to other sites and are still together. Having a shared problem and it being pain, it brings people to a tight place. To have someone get* you is just so validating. I started the Members Toolbox then, as I saw newbies would come and we all post over and over again the same tools we used to help. It is hard at times to post when the hands are involved or the headache is present. So to the left under resources is the link. WE all faught to have that remain on this site. It is helpful, it also shows we do different things and you need to learn what tools are for you. I have done just about everything to be better and spent alot of money to get back to a bit of me. I was in a recliner, not working and in pain to even bring a pot of water to the stove. I am now at 10 years able to say, I have a wellness window of 8-10 hours and work full time, really move at the office. All of this happened in small steps. Pushing...having my boxing gloves on and saying you are not getting another inch of me, I have work to do. Yes I fell back, yes he (our dragon) bit me hard at times and I crawled under a rock to rest and cry a bit....the years of me getting to acceptance seems like it took forever. The doc said this is forever and I said, yeah...I will figure it out and get out of this. I changed everything I do, how I do it, the things I use in the house like Correlle dishes (can<APO>t break them and they are so light!) this was a big trigger. Doing a journal to see your triggers and what you did to be better helps to form your toolbox. I needed to sit on my hands in the recliner to straighten the neck muscles and drop the shoulders to get the pain to be better. I still do that when i am in a headache or laying down is bothering me. I go to the recliner and posture for sleeping. Crazy mess we are in. Please read all that is available to you including the important posts in discussions up to the right. Put in Dr Pellegrino and see what he said while he was here. P R I C E L E S S. So many changes to this site. I left for a short bit as well, but I have to say helping another with a small trick or a hug gives back to the poster so much more. I returned. I just need to lean in here. I am only here on the weekends as I am beat when I am working. I am now a Clinical Supervisor and I really can<APO>t leave until it quiets down so the day is 9-10 hours long. It is the med of distraction that keeps me moving, I feel it on the way home though. So I am in rest and hot pak land when I get home.

fibromyalgia_exchange,23292_1,"Hello and welcome.....MiMi in NC...I am sorry that you are both having issues with the wrath of the dragon, aka FM....I did want to say this...I am one of the FMers here who tried several different medicines, with gabapentin being one. I did not find any of them to really help me without causing side effects and I did not need anything else to deal with....I evnetually did my own research and found help with *vitamins and supplements and doing other things as well*....it was not an easy task to do though...as with most anything and everything with the wrath of the dragon, aka FM....it takes a trial and error process... I do know that anything and everything takes at least 6-8 weeks of whatever you decide to go with. I would encourage each of you to be sure and speak to your doctor about checking your Vitamin D level....which is important to a lot of people these days....low Vitamin D can cause some of us to have addtional pain and it can also affect other illnesses as well. It is a simple blood test....BUT you must ASK the doctor to check it... I also want to say that I think *weakness* is one of the things that many of us deal with...Dr. P did a discussion and one of the *tools* he shared was trying to keep the arms *at home* as much as possible...(close to your body)...this has helped me... I hope you will check out the info under *tips* and *resources* that you will find to the right of this page...I am sure you will find some good *tools* that perhaps you have not thought of trying... Some of the other things I do to cope better are....learning how to pace, pace and pace even more...getting enough sleep...(A HUGE THING FOR ME)....drinking plenty of water and watching what I eat...do gentle stretches or exercises, (gentle being the key word)...heating pad as needed, Stopain Spray when nothing else will help (good stuff found at walmart for just under $....I also sleep in a recliner but not by choice...I have less aches and pains to deal with...being in a prone position is important for me...and I also sleep on pillows...(limits the stress on my body)... OK....just a few things for you to try...also when I am in pain right before sleep....I can take a hot shower using lavender bath salts in a stopped up drain...this helps to relax the body so that I can sleep better...and IF I am too tired....I at least soak my feet...as this also works well.

fibromyalgia_exchange,16350_14,"Ah...feel like I should tell you my story first. I have three kids. We were good parents...but reading my story you probably might not think so...but bad stuff happens these days. The oldest was always into cars and fixing up cars. He did a couple of stupid things as a kid, and we had some problems...but he did not get into drugs. He just graduated college and has a good job. The middle child...where should I start?? Started smoking cigarettes...and probably weed in about 8th grade. Got kicked out of high school, 9th grade. Back in 10th grade..got into more heavier drugs. Was sent to rehab...clean for awhile...barely made it through high school...went to community college...but another rehab right at the beginning...back to school...back to rehab...and finally was arrested. He was lucky....he didn<APO>t die and he was sentence to drug court...which meant if he stayed clean and sober, he could avoid jail and get his record cleaned up. He has been clean and sober now for about seven -eight years...(I forget how long)... He just graduated from college and is applying to graduate schools...(and put himself through college- paying all of it, except for a little amount his grandparents had put away.) My DD was always the ""good girl""...We didn<APO>t think anything would go wrong...how wrong we were...She went to college away, started partying...dropped out...went to community college...got arrested...got house arrest...and finally moved home. She is back in community college and doing fairly well, but still hasn<APO>t really given up partying...She says she is moving out in Feb. and I see that as her next downfall...she is moving in with a loser boyfriend that smokes weed and works for fast food..woo hoo... SO (!!!)...my advice is this...Take this VERY seriously. Back your husband...You will be testing your son periodically..and ANY sign he is off track...and the car is gone....you will not allow him to injure or kill others because he was partying or high. Ask your ex to join you and your son in some counseling sessions if you can..You need to get a handle on WHY he is doing this. Hopefully, it is just to ""fit in""...and it can be stopped..hopefully he is not addicted...but pot CAN be addictive these days...and it can do some bad things...I have seen it, believe me... Also, let your son know that he has LOST your trust...This is something HE will have to regain and EARN back. And tell him, he is lucky, because if he had been caught at 18, he might have a felony conviction for the rest of his life...and that would keep him from getting jobs he wants..(just ask my daughter). And yes...I grew up in the 60<APO>s-70<APO>s and pot was everywhere. However...today<APO>s pot is not like the pot of back then...It is a much more powerful drug. Tell, your son...that he is expected to get good grades this year...and he is expected to be involved in something that will expand his interests...It might be the auto club (those are hard to find these days...)..or sports or WHATEVER will keep him busy and too tired to smoke pot. He needs to be up early every day accomplishing things...including chores and helping around the house....Let him know that you and your ex will be working together on this.

And I do think stress and other health problems can cause this....I know exactly when FM hit me....I was trying to recoup from carpal tunnel surgery.....and I thought I was getting the flu....never fully recovered from this....I also have other medical problems which have definitely not helped the FM...so I also think other illness can make the FM seem much worse than it should be... I will also tell you this much......I had a very bad childhood.....mental abuse....and perhaps this too could have made a difference it all of this.....I think it is like a time bomb....waiting for just the right time to explode.....and when it does....it hits us hard..... My husband is a cancer survivor....and before he had cancer.....he was hardly ever sick....but when he got sick....he really got sick....and was treated for the cancer....so it is not where the doctor can ""see"" it now....but it had found a spot to hide somewhere until it decides to attack yet again.... That<APO>s my story and I<APO>m sticking to it on this Saturday in November...... MiMi",2.6,3.5,P

fibromyalgia_exchange,25297_0,"Hello angie and welcome. MiMi in NC. Sorry that you are dealing with so much right now. I am sure you will find lots of good info here under *tips* and *resources* and be sure and read the *member toolbox* as well. There are also many discussions which Dr P had when he was with us. Just look for Dr. P. He not only treats FM but he also suffers from it as well....so he knew first hand what life is like in dealing with the wrath of the dragon, aka FM. I am one of the FMers here who has learned how to deal with FM by taking vitamins and supplements and using other *tools* as well....but I do not take any medicines prescribed by the doctor. I, too, tried several but did not find any which worked without causing side effects. I finally did my own research and did a *trial and error process* to figure out what helped me the most....with a bit of tweaking along the way I still have good luck with this. This does take time....one must allow at least 6-9 weeks of whatever they decide to try before making a decision as to whether or not it is really helping them. We have to give our bodies time to get the full effects of what we are trying. We are all different and a lot of us have multiple health issues as well. I think this is perhaps the reason doctors have problems with trying to get something to work for us. I also have chronic fatigue and I am still trying to find something that will help my energy level. Have you gotten your doctor to check your Vitamin D level yet? If not, then I do encourage you to speak to him/her about getting this done. Low Vitamin D seems to be a *common issue* for a lot of people and it can also cause some people to have additional pain and might also affect other illnesses too. SO VERY IMPORTANT. Have you tried using a heating pad? Lots of us use one. I know this sure helps me. Drinking plenty of water each day also helps me. Water is 98% of what I drink. Doing gentle exercises and/or stretches is also a good thing to do. We, FMers, must move, no matter how we feel....not doing this enough just causes the body to get stiffer and increases our pain. Eating right and having a schedule of sorts might also help you as well. If you have problems trying to figure out why you are feeling the way you do, keeping a daily journal might also help you to pin point some of your issues. (This can also help your doctor as well) Just keep tabs on your activities, what you each and your pain levels. Getting enough sleep is also important. Lack of sleep only increases our pain level. Keeping your stress level is also important as well. (I still struggle with this though as it is sometimes very hard to do). I am glad you have found this *support group*. I am sure you will find lots of info here and people who truly understand what you are dealing with. Take care. MiMi IN GOD WE TRUST....MAY GOD BLESS AND GUIDE AMERICA....",5.5,6.0,P

But I sometimes get a spurt of energy also and if used rationally I can take that short stroll... I am in a wheelchair but use a walker and crutches when strong enough to get a stroll in... just not a long one but anything helps...

If you can<APO>t get helped from your Dr maybe it is time to look around for one that will treat FM... Perhaps your Dr doesn<APO>t know much about FM...

It sounds like you are not getting the deep restorative sleep our bodies need to heal.

It is up to me. Time management is a factor and it is a challenge when working full time to manage things perfect. You have to do the best you can. One of my Dr.s a long time ago always said to try to eat the same lunches everyday when working full time and develop a pattern for what the blood sugar will be during the heart of the work day. That helped for sure. I have had the best support about my diabetes the whole 35 years I have been a type 1. krhudson,1.7,5.4,C

These effects, (especially if you have diabetes), may increase your risk for developing heart disease. Discuss the risks and benefits of treatment with your doctor.

Just have a talk with your doctor if your A1c rises above 7%; or consider changing physicians if he/she says there is nothing you can do. If your post-prandial (do you check 2-hours after a meal?) is within the parameters (140 or under,) you should work on your a.m. fasting. You don<APO>t want your A1c to be greater than 7. There are physicians who believe that if your A1c keeps rising because of a high a.m. fasting number, basal insulin usage would be best to bring that down. This is taken at bedtime.

diabetes_exchange,8565_0,"Welcome, ZoeTre. Well... Diabetes is a disease of carbohydrate metabolism. Did you get any information from your doctor? If you have weight to lose, this helps immensely. Proper diet would be to watch the carbohydrates you ingest on a daily basis. COUNT them. They are a diabetic<APO>s nemesis. Not just sugar or sweets. Surf the web and see what you can find. Your post is a bit vague. Did your doctor take your A1C? That is an average of blood sugars over the past three months. The higher your A1C, the more damage is being done to your body. Your internal organs, eyes, circulation, nervous system, etc. Everything in your body is affected by uncontrolled diabetes. Weight loss, exercise and proper diet are the key in managing your diabetes. Exercise will help with weight loss along with helping your body utilize any extra glucose running around in your blood stream. We are all different in how we manage our diabetes. No two people are alike. Invest in a carb counter such as ""The Calorie King."" Paperback and online counter. Look at nutrition labels on all packaged food. Boxes, cans, etc. The important line to look at is TOTAL CARBOHYDRATE line. My dietician recommended for me 35-45 grams of carbs per meal. Many can eat more than that. My diabetes was out of control and any carb I eat sends my blood sugar soaring. Stay away from simple carbs such as your ""white"" foods. Breads, potatoes, pasta, rice are bad for us. Add more fiber to your diet. Stick to lean proteins, lots and lots of veggies, some fruits. There is a glycemic index which you can look at. The higher on this list, the more carbs and sugars these foods contain. Stick to those foods lower on that index. Do as your doctors suggests. Lose weight and figure out a proper diet. You can consult with a dietician if need be. Many diabetics manage with diet alone. AND exercise. That is very important. Most times diet alone will not suffice. Good luck to you and again, welcome, Zoe",2.1,5.1,F
diabetes_exchange,7314_1,"Dear Jadarq, Thank you for your question about how to control your type 2 diabetes in the setting of Crohns disease. Sounds to me like you need a very precise understanding of what vegetables, and in what quantity, your body will tolerate. Keeping a careful journal of your food intake and your degree of symptoms is a crucial tool for success here. If your doctors are not opposed, you may want to take a systematic approach by eating a standard diet based primarily on lean protein and other healthy foods you know you can tolerate, then add in (one at a time) foods that you are unsure about to see how each addition affects you. The Dukan diet (which is much like the Atkins diet) is on my mind right now because I just reviewed it. Looks pretty good for what you are trying to do. Protein power also a good strategy for someone who does not do well with too much vegetable matter. Lastly, I<APO>ll let you know that there is compelling preliminary research indicating that Crohns disease responds very well to ""immunotherapy"" with live pig roundworm, which helps normalize the intestinal inflammatory response.

diabetes_exchange,6822_35,"Allie: The short answer is that your doctor may have you try other or additional medications to stabilize your blood glucose levels. Or he/she may make changes to the dosages of medications you are currently taking. If oral medications don<APO>t do the trick, insulin therapy may be suggested. Don<APO>t freak out when I mention insulin!!! It is an effective therapy for some people. And the insulin injections are nearly painless. Second, it is not unusual to feel fatigued when your blood glucose levels are unstable. That happens to a lot of people. Try to be patient as the doctor attempts to find the best medication protocol to help you achieve better glucose control. It sometimes just takes some time to find the correct combination. Hang in there. This will get better in time. In the meantime, continue to eat properly, get some exercise, and by all means test and record your home glucose testing results and a description of the foods you eat. That will be a big help to the doctor. David Watch what people are cynical about, and one can often discover what they lack. - General George Patton Jr",4.3,6.0,F

When you are overweight and/or are eating too many carbs or food in general for your body and your exercise program, your pancreas beta cells will begin chugging out as much insulin as is necessary to deal with the amount of sugar in your blood stream. At first, your pancreas can keep up and this is why your insulin level is high and your blood sugars normal. Actually, a raised blood sugar level may be the LAST thing to occur in diabetes. Even complications such as nerve damage, stomach digestive disorders, heart damage and others may occur before your blood sugar numbers go up. I have read that by the time a person is diagnosed with diabetes, he has already lost 80% of his beta cells due to overwork and burn out! When your pancreas gets worn out, it can<APO>t keep producing the amount of insulin necessary to keep up with the sugars, and then your numbers start going up and you have full-fledged diabetes, not just pre-diabetes.

multiple_sclerosis_exchange,2620_1,"Hello Cathy, I agree with what Kim posted! If you are concerned that you may have MS then follow these steps: 1. Talk to your primary care physician (PCP) first 2. Get a referral to a neurologist, one who specializes in treating patients with MS. 3. Follow through with all the tests he/she recommends 4. If, after following step 3, you are still unsatisfied with the diagnosis, get a second opinion. If you do not have a PCP, then find a neuro on your own. You will need to do some homework to find the best one in your area. If there are none in your area, then find the closest one and make an appointment. Often times neurologists won?t take on a patient unless they are referred to them by another doctor, thus the reason behind step 1. Hopefully you will have some health insurance to help you with the costs. Remember that all neurologists are not created equal and thus the need for step 2. Keep in mind that you are paying the doctors, not the other way around. If you do not like the first doc, then find a second, third, fourth and so on until you find a doc you have confidence in. Some times it can take quite a while to finally get a diagnosis (dx). Start keeping a journal of your symptoms, when they occur, what body part is affected, how the symptom makes your feel, when the symptom occurs (time and date) and how long it lasts. Then when you go to see the doc have a brief synopsis of the contents of the journal. Several good resources to learn more about MS to help guide people are the National MS Society www.nmss.org, National MS Foundation, www.msfacts.org and Multiple Sclerosis Assoc of America www.msaa.com. If you are in Canada your might try www.mssociety.ca To find a doctor in your area that is recommend by other MS patients Clams www.clams.org good doc<APO>s list. Your local MS Society can give you a list also but they typically give a list of all neuros, not just MS specialists, so they need to do more research.

All I can suggest is a complete review and possible retesting by a Specialist or MS care center as that will at least rule out MS alltogether if not diagnose it and then you can look for other causes.

multiple_sclerosis_exchange,91_1,Hi !! I was just DX in the middle of my first episode this last April 08. I at first wasnt sure about taking any of the meds / MS shots . ( I hate all the side effects and discloseures that seem to come along with meds these days ) but after ALOT of research I found that the MS patients that were not able to take treatment in the earlier years ( because the meds were not available ) progressed in the disease and within 15 or 20 years seemed to have a lot of issues and problems and some were incapacitated. 2 of these were people I knew ( friends of my family ) I cant help but wonder if they were able to take some form of treatment if maybe they would have had a more normal quality of life and not had these issues or at least until they were older instead of 45/ 50. totally incapacitated ( these 2 were DX in their late 20<APO>s and did not receive treatment. ) to each his own but I decided I would rather take the shots and hope that they help slow the progression of the disease. ( I dont love the shots but they arent so bad either. I take Betaseron and have had NO troubles. ) Good luck in your decision ( I have heard you can be getting lesions and not know it until it is too late and then you have the symptoms that sometimes stay. If you are on meds they may prevent those lesions) Debi,2.55,4.2,P

multiple_sclerosis_exchange,4908_0,"Dear Ladyheather, Despite what some doctors tell us, there is no such thing as a typical case of MS, we each present with the initial symptoms in our own unique ways. Our disabilities are a consequence of the location of the damage and to what extent our bodies can repair it. An MS diagnosis is hard to make and involves a process of elimination. Many conditions share common symptoms with MS. It<APO>s always a good idea to get a second opinion from an MS specialist. Fatigue and heat intolerance are very common symptoms, I have them and they were part of my earliest disease symptoms. The first five years after my initial attack were virtually symptom-free (some foot drop, fatigue and heat intolerance) and I had no relapses. After that, I<APO>ve flared once every five years with worsened disabilities each time. The third flare required me to retire on SSDI. But lots of people can continue to work for many years, we<APO>re all different. Starting a disease-modifying therapy early in the disease can go a long way to slow the progress of your MS. There is no connection between flu shots and developing MS, in fact, we are encouraged to get a yearly flu shot. Viral infections can trigger an MS attack, however. We have overactive immune systems that can go rogue fighting off an infection and then start attacking our own myelin. Hope this helps. Kim",2.6,6.1,P

multiple_sclerosis_exchange,5289_0,"Hello, Demyelinating lesions can be caused by vascular accidents such as stroke, as well as by MS, Lyme disease, and migraines can also cause lesions as a result of poor blood flow. The number of possible differentials is one reason why diagnosing MS involves an array of different tests, which include brain MRIs with and without contrast; a spine MRI; evoked potentials tests; a lumbar puncture; a neurologic exam that tests your balance, strength, coordination, and senses; and a symptom history. Migraines and tension headaches can be a presenting symptom of MS (see http://networkedblogs.com/OAZWP ) and can occur very early in life. Personally, I had such headaches starting at age 10 without any other MS symptoms. As far as migraine lesions vs MS lesions, there can be differences regarding location, shape and size, but it<APO>s complicated--again, this is why MS diagnostics involve a variety of different tests that are done and repeated over time.

multiple_sclerosis_exchange,4522_0,"Nana, It<APO>s good that you had the EMG and MRIs, please let us know the results. Though they might not bring a definitive diagnosis, at least you are establishing some baselines for future testing. Since MS is so hard to diagnose, it can take a while to rule out other causes that share the same symptoms. If you have MS, it can sometimes take a while to reveal itself on a scan or a lumbar puncture. Low vit D and B12 despite medication is one indication that your body isn<APO>t properly absorbing those vitamins, which is one problem people with MS experience. To complicate matters further, these deficiencies can also cause MS-like symptoms by themselves. If you have a skin condition like the gal you mentioned, that is not MS-related. Her symptom was a result of leukemia--but skin rashes can also be caused by medication side effects as well as other causes. Finally, it is not unusual to develop another autoimmune disease along with MS. I hope you give us an update on your test results.

I've had it since 1999, I was able to work for ten more years after that, and 14 years later I only need a cane to walk. Your girlfriend's doctors are only at the beginning of testing, there will be more to come. Normal test results are valuable, they can rule out some of the possibilities and/or serve as a baseline for tests that might be repeated in the future. In my case, I didn't get the diagnosis until six years after my first attack. It took that long for me to test positive on enough of the tests--repeat brain and spine MRIs, LPs, evoked potentials, etc.--along with having another attack.

multiple_sclerosis_exchange,3657_2,"Hello Lefty, If you are concerned that you may have MS then follow these steps: Talk to your primary care physician (PCP) first Get a referral to a neurologist, one who specializes in treating patients with MS. Follow through with all the tests he/she recommends If, after following step 3, you are still unsatisfied with the diagnosis, get a second opinion. If you do not have a PCP, then find a neuro on your own. You will need to do some homework to find the best one in your area. If there are none in your area, then find the closest one and make an appointment. Often times neurologists won't take on a patient unless they are referred to them by another doctor, thus the reason behind step 1. Hopefully you will have some health insurance to help you with the costs. Remember that all neurologists are not created equal and thus the need for step 2. Keep in mind that you are paying the doctors, not the other way around. If you do not like the first doc, then find a second, third, fourth and so on until you find a doc you have confidence in. Some times it can take quite a while to finally get a diagnosis (dx). Start keeping a journal of your symptoms, when they occur, what body part is affected, how the symptom makes your feel, when the symptom occurs (time and date) and how long it lasts. Then when you go to see the doc have a brief synopsis of the contents of the journal. Several good resources to learn more about MS to help guide people are the National MS Society www.nmss.org, National MS Foundation, www.msfacts.org and Multiple Sclerosis Assoc of America www.msaa.com. If you are in Canada your might try www.mssociety.ca To find a doctor in your area that is recommend by other MS patients Clams www.clams.org good doc's list. Your local MS Society can give you a list also but they typically give a list of all neuros, not just MS specialists, so they need to do more research. Neuro ratings can sometimes be helpful as well. http://www.msneuroratings.com/ Don't quit! Keep up your search to find out what is wrong with you. Sometimes it will turn out you do have MS but often you will find you have something completely different. Your search for a dx can be tortuous sometimes, that is why I say don't quit. Keep coming back here and read what other people have been experiencing, what their treatment regime is and how they (we) cope with having this disease. Thank you to those other MS'ers who helped me improve this post! Good luck, Dave",2.4,5.8,F

multiple_sclerosis_exchange,4506_0,"Hi, Anon, All great questions. It's possible that Gilenya was tested against Avonex only because Avonex is considered the \gold standard\"" among therapies; it is the oldest one and therefore has been studied the longest. People certainly do switch from Tysabri back to one of the injectable therapies. However, while there are studies of patients who switched from those therapies to Tysabri, it is hard to find studies on those who switch from Tysabri to Rebif, Avonex, Copaxone, etc. Plasmapheresis is used for MS mostly to treat acute attacks if steroids have not been effective. I don't think it is used on a long-term basis like the DMDs. That said, there are some specialists who do monthly infusions of ACTH (a form of steroid) to treat severe and/or numerous flares. I'm looking into this for myself right now since I stopped Tysabri several months ago and currently on no DMDs. I don't know if I could use this treatment for chronic symptoms that are not associated with a flare, but I will find out once I get an appt. Have you had the JCV test? If not, your infusion clinic might be part of that trial and provide you with the blood test. If you are JCV positive, that might be a factor in your decision whether to remain on Tysabri. If your MRIs and flare patterns have improved on Tysabri, you might decide that the benefits outweigh the risks. It's a personal decision with no right or wrong answers. I wish you well with those decisions, it does get a bit complicated. I'm on the fence myself--and content to stay there for a while. Kim""",1.5,4.9,P

multiple_sclerosis_exchange,4796_0,"Chloe, Sounds like it might be disc problems or an arthritic spine, or even MS-related muscle spasticity. I did have increased pain in those areas starting a few months ago. Since I already know I have a herniated cervical disc and an arthritic lumbar spine, as well as bulging and dessicated discs all the way down the spine, I could attribute the neck and lower back pain to those spine problems, so the pain wasn't new, just worse. All my old tricks for relieving this pain over the years stopped working. And sitting at the computer for long periods of time just worsened my neck and shoulder pain. I have muscle spasticity in other areas which also worsened and I increased my baclofen dosage. I started taking Lyrica for neuropathic pain as well. Unfortunately, the neck and lumbar pain haven't responded to these drugs so I'll need to pursue another avenue. Physical therapy or just being more active is what's recommended for this--but PT didn't help me and I'm unable to do activity that would target these areas. So a cortisone shot might be on the agenda. Complicated, huh? If you haven't already, you should mention your spine pain to your doc. If you have no history of spine problems, your doc might want to order an MRI to check for bad discs.

What he brings in is your money just as much. Your money I'm sure was just as much his money to use as well. You can't help having MS, anymore than he's would be able to help having a disease. Would you expect him to feel guilty if he was unable to work? Didn't think so. It's hard not to be able to work, you feel like you've lost so much. But, you have to take each step in life and deal with it. Don't look back, see what you can do and build on it. Maybe volunteer, MS society, local hospital, schools, countless places that can use some extra help. Since you're not working, you should be able to work around a schedule that works for you.

multiple_sclerosis_exchange,2724_0,"ElMike, Welcome to the board and happy holidays! After several years on Copaxone, I switched to Rebif in August. It's a shallow, easy injection with a very short, thin needle. I've had more side effects on Rebif, but three shots a week is far fewer than the daily Copaxone injections I took for over four years. Try not to think of it as a forever thing, this choice isn't written in stone. There comes a time when we're armed with enough info, experience, and confidence to tell our neuros what therapy we wish to try. There are other options, like monthly infusion therapies. Some new drug trials will give us more choices soon, too, oral drugs among them. Nobody can predict how you'll tolerate Rebif, give it some time and track your symptoms. If you don't like it, you can ask your neuro for another alternative. Having MS really blows, so it BEHOOVES us and our doctors to find a therapy that is as easy as possible and doesn't make our day blow even more. Kim",2.3,5.1,P

The are not used as a Disease Modifying Therapy which are the class of meds used to reduce and slow down(not prevent) future symptoms. I am going to add a post I have saved that will hopefully let you know where you are in terms of a diagnosis. 1 Find a neuro who specializes in MS or an MS care center, try www.msneuroratings.com for patient reviews on a state by state basis. 2 Be prepared to undergo all testing the require which may include, A MRI's of the brain and cervical spine with and without contrast to look for active and inactive liaisons. B Possibly a lumber puncture/ spinal tap to look for proteins and O-bands in the fluid around your brain and spine. C Evoked potential testing to check the speed of your nerve responses, any delay can indicate inflammation. D A complete neuro workup and a review of your medical history, try to keep a journal of your symptoms and how long the last and any triggers you can think have. After all this which can take some time, you can hope that a specialist has enough info to make a diagnosis or at least rule out MS altogether, all though there are no guarantees as we often see false negatives or inconclusive results For now find a specialist and follow his/her advice , let us know how you are doing and know that most of us have been where you are and indeed some on here still are there.

I would keep a journal of your problems when they start with dates, how long they last with dates and severity. Keeping a journal can help the doctor in diagnosis of any problem. Your symptoms don't jump out MS to me but we here are not doctors. You might go to the National MS Society www.nmss.org and see the symptoms of MS to see if there are or are not similarities. Do press on with the doctors to find out what IS the cause. Also don't forget that even if there isn't a diagnosis symptoms of pain can be controlled by meds. Don't let them brush you off.

If indeed it turns out you have MS and this is a flair (excaberation) then your new symptoms could meet this . It is time for a call to your neuro, to see if there is any further testing that the can do or repeat. Some neuros will diagnose a condition called Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) if there is some evidence of MS but not enough for a full diagnosis. The diagnosis does not mean that full MS will develop but it enables them to start the patient on treatment which will hopefully delay the onset of MS.

multiple_sclerosis_exchange,5096_0,"Dear May, Being JCV positive means that her risk of developing PML, a fatal brain infection, is higher than for a patient who is JCV negative. Some Tysabri users who are JCV positive do stay on the drug because it is keeping their MS in check and they are willing to take the risk. Those at highest risk for PML are those who have these three risk factors: 1. They are JCV positive, 2. Have weakened immune systems from taking certain immunosuppressant drugs prior to starting Tysabri, and 3. Have taken Tysabri for more than two years. Your sister should take these risk factors into account when making her decision to continue with the drug. Being JCV positive doesn't mean she'll get sick, the JC virus itself is not symptomatic. Exposure to it makes her susceptible to more serious infections, and so she should be careful taking medications that weaken the immune system. Hope this helps. Kim",2.2,5.6,P

You can't make him seek out therapy, but you can talk to him about it and express your concerns. He might not be aware that his behavior is affecting the family. Does he drink to self-medicate? Did the depression precede the alcoholism--or is the disease the source of his sadness? A therapist would sort this out and recommend a treatment plan.

multiple_sclerosis_exchange,5220_0,"Dear anon, Seek a therapist on your own first. You and your counselor will discuss what steps you might take. Once a man focuses his resentment on you and your disease and resists intimacy, it's unlikely he will want to try to save the marriage. I just went through a similar situation, sought out a therapist first, and my husband and I are now separated. I love my husband, too, and he begged me to come back two months after I left him--but my common sense tells me that the cycle of resentment will come around again. I won't go back. I feel better about myself now. You will find love again. Your self-esteem might be in the toilet right now, but once you remove yourself from that relationship, you will begin to repair. I don't quite understand why a bladder implant would prevent an MRI unless it is made of a ferrous metal. As far as other tests are concerned, did you have a normal lumbar puncture, normal evoked potentials, normal clinical exams that tested reflexes, coordination, strength and balance?

breast_cancer_exchange,2772_0,"Jane, Welcome to this website where the ladies are compassionate and have many varied experiences with the myriad of treatment options for breast cancer. I am sorry that you have also had to deal with breast cancer. From my research it seems that for Tamoxifen, the hot flashes are signs that it is working. Tamoxifen has been used for over 30 years and has been studied very well and has 30 years of statistics behind the drug. I do not take Tamoxifen, I take Fareston, but I'm sure the ladies here who take Tamoxifen will give you more informatiion. Joint pain might be a side effect of Tamoxifen, although joint pains are a common side effect from taking the Aromatase Inhibitors - Aromasin, Aeimidex and Femera. Also you might want to see if your knee joint pain may be an indication of osteoarthritis. Good luck to you. Judy",3.4,4.8,P

breast_cancer_exchange,3205_2,"Diane, I just had a wild thought - don't know if it makes sense, but here goes. Finish the round of herceptin and then ask for a PET scan. PET scans show where there are cancer clusters. Can a PET scan show the axillary nodes - and would insurance even pay for it? If you can have the PET scan after you finish chemo, that may help you decide your next step. Please stay in touch with us. Judy",3.1,4.5,F
breast_cancer_exchange,2534_3,"The answers to your questions are determined on what type of reconstruction you decide to have and which one you are a candidate for. Each type of reconstruction has different recovery times which are further complicated by your personal health and powers of recuperation. A plastic surgeon is the best one to answer your questions. Asking about recovery time is like asking pregnant women how long they were in labor - each one is different and they would all have different answers. So one member here may say she recovered in 2 weeks while another might say her recuperation took 12 weeks. It is very individual. Each case is totally different even with the same type of reconstruction there can be totally different outcomes. You other concern about not having someone at home to take care of you after surgery, can probably be answered by the ladies here. While I did not have a mastectomy, from what I have heard you will need some help at home the first few weeks after the surgery. I hope the ladies here can answer some of your questions and address your concerns about the recuperation. You might want to call the American cancer Society as they have people you can speak to who have been through reconstruction and they can answer your questions. I wish you much luck and hope you can get some of your questions answered. Judy",2.6,5.6,P

breast_cancer_exchange,3715_0,"You are not paranoid - just very anxious, worried and overwhelmed with everything that has been going on in your life for this past year. So why don't you try to prioritize your health problems at this point. You are taking care of your gall bladder problem so you need to get through that surgery physically, and emotionally. And you really need to take care of your breast situation. Here is what I would suggest. 1. Get some anti-anxiety meds from your doc for the surgery and the breast because it might take a few weeks to get the answer to what is going on with your breast. 2. Have your breast examined by a breast doctor. Call Planned Parenthood, or Susan Komen or the American cancer Society to find a clinic or a doctor who works with them to help women who do not have health insurance. You first must be seen by a doctor who will then take it from there as to whether or not you need a mammo or other tests. 3. You need to ultimately take control of your health - once you feel like you are in control you will feel less overwhelmed. I really don't know what it could be - cysts related to your menstrual cycle, clogged milk duct, benign tumors, an infection or even breast cancer. Also know that there are many different types of breast diseases which are not all cancerous, so only a doctor can diagnose you. And as you have already said you know you must see a doctor - so take a deep breath and make the necessary phone calls to begin to take control of finding out what is going on with your breast. We are always here for you, and I wish you good luck with your surgery. Please come back and let us know how your surgery went and what you find out about what is going on with your breast.

But the top was a different story I just had a little peach fuss that just didn't want to grow. When it did finally grow it looks like male patterend baldness it never came back in fully. It is very thin and you can see my skin I still have some bare spots. I too use a mouse that makes your hair look thicker. But sometimes it just doesn't work and can be a downer when going out and your hair just doesn't want to do anything and looks very thin to nothing on top. I still don't have much for eye brows either or eye lashes for that matter. I had the same drugs as you and am triple neg also so am not taking any drugs for the cancer now. My hair is starting to get back to my normal thickness in the back and sides but not on top it is still pretty thin and it is 3 1/2 years since chemo has been done. I don't know how much longer it is going to take to get back to normal all over my head but I sure hope it does soon. Because this is sure well past the year they say that it usually takes for it to grow back.

This could be the result of the dog injuring your breast, or related to your menstrual cycle, or just lumpy breasts, or some kind of benifn breast condition or something more serious. You really should be seen by a doctor. Can you go to an emergency room in a hospital that treats people even if they don't have insurance?

breast_cancer_exchange,2042_1,I would recommend that you make an appointment with a breast specialist or breast surgeon since your problems have solely involved the breast for many years. Your family doctor may not be experienced with problems of the breast.

breast_cancer_exchange,3669_0,"I too was diagnosed with stage 1 ductal carcinoma at the age of 67 - two years ago with no family history. As women age their chances of getting breast cancer increase, and women over age 65 are at risk the most. First please know that your cancer cells were found early. You have not said if there is a mass present that needs to be biopsied. One course of action if there is no mass present might be to watch that breast through mammograms. The other choice would be to possibly do a mammogram,and ultrasound and then maybe a biopsy to get a more definitive diagnosis. Then depending on the diagnosis - you will be given surgical options which could be a lumpectomy or a mastectomy, and then that pathology will help your doctors determine whether or not you need chemo and/or radiation. So this is a process that will have you having diagnostic tests and waiting for results - which is probably the most difficult part of this journey. Since you say you are prone to anxiety, I would suggest that you speak to your doctor to get some anti-anxiety meds to help you get through the next couple of weeks.

Let's put things in a bit of perspective, okay? You volunteered as a test case. The machine is new as is this particular procedure. Now, that tells me I might be a little leery of accepting the results without a little more info. You say it usually involves contrast, but you didn't have this...Another part of the equation I might question. You begin by stating that there is a \history\"" of breast cancer in your family, but there is only a report of one case and that is an aunt...Usually they look most seriously to those in your immediate family, especially if there are multiple cases. You are quite young to be diagnosed with cancer...but it doesn't necessarily follow that you couldn't get it. You are beating yourself up for not doing regular exams...STOP! Yes, it is suggested that we all do them monthly...HOWEVER, some cancers (such as mine) CANNOT BE FELT!! So, had I glued my hand to my breast for the entire month, I'd never have felt it. In fact, on the day before the mammogram which revealed the mass, I had my annual exam and my doctor had done a breast exam, and found nothing! Give yourself a little pass on that. You've enough to deal with as is! Now, what do you know? You were tested on a new type of MRI machine (one which uses contrast but you did not have that) and \""something\"" appeared. Now it is suggested that you go for further testing. I think you already know that you won't rest until this mystery is solved, right? And you don't sound like a good candidate for a career as an ostrich! Soooooo...would I have further testing. Yep! Do I think you should immediately begin to load up on stressful conclusions? Not at all. Further testing may well prove that there is no reason to be concerned.

breast_cancer_exchange,3480_0,"Since estrogen positive bc is very common in women over the age of 50 - it seems that your doctors are going with the prevailinhg statistics in having you do hormone therapy. You have not been diagnosed with bc - but ADH does put you at greater risk for being diagnosed with bc at some time in the future. Hence the reason for hormone therapy. Tamoxifrn and aromatase inhibitors are 2 different classes of anti-estrogens and they both have side effects which are very different from one another. Both pre and post menopausal women can take Tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors are used for post menopausal women. Tamoxifen belongs to a group of drugs known as SERM's which prevent the estrogen receptors on the surface of cancer cells from letting the estrogen into the cell so the cell can grow and multiply. With Tamoxifen, the body still manufactures estrogen. The side effects could be hot flashes, insominia, weight gain, and the rare more serious side effects of blood clots andthe possibility of endometrial cancer. Most women on Tamoxifen also have a vaginal ultrasound done to check for that. Aromatase Inhibitors actually block the body from making estrogen, so there is no estrogen in the body. The AI's can also cause hot flashes, insominia and weight gain, vaginal dryness and their more serious side effects are, osteopenia (which can lead to osteoporosis) severe muscle aches and pains. So they all have side effects and if you do decide to take one of these drugs - I would recommend you speak with your oncologist about the side effects of each drug, and then choose if you want to take an anti estrogen drug, and if so - which drug you want to take. Please let us know what you decide to do. Good luck, Judy",2.6,6.6,P

I have been very busy the past few weeks and have a lot going on this time of year is always busy for me up until after the holidays. But I like it that way it keeps my mind busy also and it is nice to have something to do with friends and family not sitting at home all the time doing the same old thing cook clean and more of the same thing. I can only redo rooms so many times lol... I have started painting and redoing friends rooms for them because I am so bored and have done most of my rooms lol.. Do you need any painting done? lol... I have found useing a paint roller is very good therapy for the chest muscles and scar tissue it helps break it up and it losens things up really nice doing that movement. I was helping a freind paint a few weeks after my last surgery and before I could hardly move my arm. The day of and day after I was sore but by the 3 rd day I had total movement and could put my arms over my head I couldn't do that before painting. So it really helps I told my pt therapist and she said because it is the same movement she has me doing when sliding my hands up the wall. So now I am painting more because I am bored with the colors of my rooms lol. I am feeling pretty good I still have some pain and tightness but getting better.

It took me a while to find what would work for me but like you said it doesn't go away 100% but at least it let up some.

breast_cancer_exchange,2017_0,"That depends upon what kind of biopsy you are having - core needle or sterotactic biopsy or an excisional biopsy. The first two are usually done after the breast is numbed and you do not feel anything at the time of the biopsy. Afterward there is some bruising, and soreness, but it is bearable and does get better over time. Excisional biopsies can be done under local or general anesthesia and sometimes do succeed in actually removing the whole mass. I would suggest that you call the surgeon and ask him/her to walk you through the procedure that is being planned for you. Those of us answering you can only guess what will be done and maybe our answers might create more anxiety for you or give you incorrect information.

So my advice is to call the surgeon and speak to him/her and you will get the information you need to prepare emotionally for your procedure. I wish you good luck, and encourage you to be your own advocate and ask questions to obtain whatever information you need to fully understand what your treatment will involve. Please keep in touch and let us know how you are doing. Much good luck to you. Judy",4.1,5.0,P
breast_cancer_exchange,1257_0,"If you google birads, you will get an explanation of the term, etc. Basically, it would seem that your breasts might be rather dense which makes \seeing\"" into them more difficult. Hence, in order to be sure of what might be there, further testing was done. Birads are broken down into numbers to clarify which breasts would benefit from further investigation. 4 indicates that more testing is necessary. HOWEVER....It does not necessarily mean cancer! The \""suspicious abnormaility\"" is what they want to investigate just in case. It may well turn out to be nothing, but they aren't going to let you slip through the cracks!

And, at the same time, one of the real curses was that we had so many choices, so many options!!!! Between a rock and hard place so often, right? It is good that scientists have narrowed at least one of the genetic markers which might indicate our greater chances of getting the disease. (I'm sure that in years to come more will be found.) But choosing to trust the test to the point of having a profilactic double mastectomy? Wow! That's a really tough place to be, and my heart goes out to you. Can't help but think that if you were actually faced with being diagnosed with cancer, the choice would not even enter the picture. You just would do what is needed so that you were not claimed by the cancer. Honestly, were I in your place, I don't know exactly what road I might take. I do know that I would do lots and lots of research and ask lots and lots of questions! And think and pray hard before deciding.

However, I must say that every single nurse that I have encountered since then at the surgical oncologist's office, medical oncologist's office, and during treatment itself, have been wonderful!!

If positive, one of the things you will find out is the possible % you have of developing breast cancer. Maybe that number would influence your decision - monitor closely or double mastectomy. Also having a double mastectomy and reconstruction involves more than one surgery which could also include could possible health, cosmetic and emotional problems which you should be aware of. I would have the genetic test and do extensive research about having a mastectomy and the pros and cons of all the different forms of breast reconstruction, immediate or delayed. Remember, you are a unique person with your own individual health history - so just because you might know women who breezed through their mastectomy and reconstruction - that may or may not be your experience.

My surgeon told me upon removing my tumor that it looked worrisome to her but she would wait for the path report. She was right. If I were in your shoes I would take the time and see the surgeon and get his/her opinion and have the biopsy. The best prevention is early detection.

Some hospital have a program where you can get a home help aid to come in each day to help with the drains and so on. You may also be able to get someone to come in to help with house work, these are things you would have to check out in your area. I could get all of this but had a very good friend that stayed with me and helped me out for about 3 weeks. I give you alot of credit for coming on this site and doing the work and research before just going right into surgery. It takes a lot for some to go on a site and ask for help but this shows you really want to do what is best for you and you want some help to see what all the options may be.

Kiwi..........that all makes sense to me.The skin does stiffen and harden to a sort. That breast on me is 'firmer' than the other and does not have as much 'give' to it. In fact in the same area that is sore right now that is under that breast when I bend over that breast kind of digs in there and may account for some of the soreness. Also, I think that is where the 'thickening of the skin' is coming from that showed up on my mammo a couple of weeks ago. The breast is REALLY firm. Which is from radiation is my conclusion.But my dr's will watch it anyway, as I would want them too. And speaking of scar tissue that is another 'yes' I'm sure. I had 3 surgeries in one location with my lumpectomy. Yes there is scar tissue there, it is hardened to some extent there.The scar from the node removal is indented because of the scaroma rupture and it is hardened there as well. This is normal and original to scaring but being in these tender and soft places it is more noticable. I use my arm as normal. I now stretch it, lift with it, work with it etc; BUT..........going into all these surgeries I was not told to use the arm so I gave in to it and babied it thinking that was best to heal, WRONG !

breast_cancer_exchange,2967_1,I am glad you have gotten back to us and that you are finally going to have some answers. I had a stereotactic biopsy. You will lie face down on a table with your breast hanging down. The breast will be numbed and you will not feel anything - you will probably hear the needle clicking as it takes samples. I drove myself to and from the biopsy and did not feel any pain or discomfort after the procedure. So you can go to work afterwards. I had no pain after the stereotactic biopsy at all. You should have the results in a few days. Please let us know how it all turns out. Good luck tomorrow morning and know that we are there with you in spirit! Judy,4.8,4.9,C

breast_cancer_exchange,1825_2,"I am now doing chemo and spoke to my surgeon about not doing radiation. He said if I were a family member he would very, very strongly recommend doing radiation since the chances of recurrence increase tremendously if one does not undergo radiation. He is an experienced, compassionate breast surgeon who has many years of experience in this area and very easy to talk to and I respect his advice and opinion. So after speaking to him I have decided to go through with the radiation when I finish my chemo. I have IDC - stage 1 - Er positive - HER neg. From reading posts on this website - it seems that most women are able to tolerate the radiation, many of them continue working right through their treatments. Is it possible for you to start the radiation and if it turns out to be intolerable or unbearable can you stop it? I'm sorry that I could not help you from direct personal experience, but I just wanted to share what my surgeon told me. Much good luck in making the right decision for you. Judy",3.0,4.1,F
breast_cancer_exchange,2711_22,"Hello and glad to hear your home and that family and friends are there to help you. Make sure to get your rest and take it slow listen to your body and don't over do it. You may feel like your ready to do things but remember your body has been through a lot. So it needs time to heal inside and out. Now some ideas for trying to sleep and sit comfortable with the drains, I used a lot of pillows under my arms so that nothing was pushing on or touching the drains when sitting or laying down. Because when the get hit it hurts so avoid it at all cost if I could. I couldn't wait to get them out and felt much better when they were 100% better.I also put pillows under my head and shoulders in bed so I wasn't laying flat to sleep. Because when flat it seams to put more pressure and hurt more in the chest area.I slept in my reclining chase for the first few nights so I was more up right and the drains work better that way my doctor told me not to lay flat for a week. I still say most of the pain was from them not the surgery. Make sure to take the pain pills as perscribed do not wait for the pain to get bad then it is to late, stay on top of the pain. These are just little tips that I wish I had known when I had my surgery 3 1/2 years ago, Oh and there is a breast cancer shop in our hospital don't know if you have one but worth checking into. I got a cami that has a band around the inside that holds litlle pockets that hold your drains and they velcro onto the band on the top so you don't have to hold them or pin them to anything. The top are cotton like a t shirt very comfortable and look nice under other button up shirts I love mine I was given 2 of them for free. They are white so will go with everything. You could even call the american cancer and ask them if they have or know how to get them.Well I hope this has helped you out some.Have a good day and speedy recovery angel hugs Roberta.

breast_cancer_exchange,2338_0,"I had 6 rounds of taxotere/cytoxan and did fine with it. My onco score was 20 and I am also overweight. During chemo I completely changed my eating habits - 6 meals a day loaded with lean protein, soups, lots and lots of organic fruits and vegetables and a lot of water! I also took the time to rest after the chemo and knew my worst days were 3-5 days after the chemo and I did not plan to do anything during those days. If I felt bad I could rest or if I felt good I could go out and do things. My only advice to you would be to ignore the poll results - because what works for one patient is not necessarily the right treatment for another patient. The only question you need to answer is \What decision that I make can I live with without having regrets and always second guessing myself\""? Therefore there are only 2 questions you should be asking yourself and the answers to them should be your guide as to what you need to do for you - not do what I did which worked for me. Can you be OK with not doing chemo if the cancer does recur either locally or as a distant recurence and can you be able to live with yourself if you decide to do chemo even though it goes against your own personal health/body beliefs?\"" The decision must be one you can live with that will not cause you anxiety and frustration and regets in the future. You must do what is right for you and not do what other people say you should do - or what the majority of the poll shows. It's YOUR body, YOUR decision and you are the only one that has to live with the consequences of that decision. That is why you must make the decision that totally works for YOU! I wish you good luck with this process. Please let us know what you eventually do decide. Judy""",3.5,4.8,F
breast_cancer_exchange,3081_1,"Jean, I'm so sorry all this has happened right before Christmas! And you are correct in keeping yourself busy while you wait for the results of the biopsy. The waiting is the absolute worst part - deep breathing exercises do help the anxiety quite a bit. Just try to inhale deeply through your mouth, hold for a count of 6 and then slowly exhale through mouth to a count of 10. Do that a few times and it might help. First and foremost your surgeon is 200% correct in saying that calcifications are usually benign and are common as the breast (not you!) age. And if they are cancerous it is very, very, treatable with an excellent prognosis! So while all of this stinks - the outcome whatever it is will allow you to marry off your son and daughter and be around to walk down the aisle for your grandson's wedding! Your venting is also very normal and we know those feelings you are having - we have all had them. I am not minnimizing them - just letting you know we understand - and want you to feel free to come here and vent anytime - and don't apologize for doing that!

What I have seen is that everyone is different and so are their doctors. But I think that everyone has had problems with the expanders! I just now am able to sleep on my right side.

breast_cancer_exchange,548_0,"Sorry you remain in limbo, but glad you came to this site to help ease the stress. I think the doctor may be thinking it is DCIS...Ductal Cancer Insitu...A type of cancer (sometimes called pre-cancer) which is in the milk ducts and has not gone beyond them. This type is not palpable (no lumps you can feel), and does not show up on an US. I think the reason for the MRI is that the doctor is attemtping to avoid a biopsy unless it is really indicated. If it does prove to be DCIS, it should be readily treatable. So, Kiddo, exhale! Your chances as of now seem pretty good...Maybe not a \B9 report, but absolutely doable! You will remain in our thoughts. blessings. Rachael PS...Two things: If the tension is really bad, ask the doctor for a Rx for an anti-anxiety med until Tuesday to help with the sleep issue.

Yes I have a lot of good memories of him some very funny ones of our cat riding on his back when they were both very small it was so cute and funny. The dog was all white our cat very dark brown almost black his name coco. Then they would lay together and clean each other I had never seen anything like it before. Dakota my dog would always lay with me when I was sick during my surgery and chemo he was like a very good friend and never left my side. Then he took over as care taker for our little Kaiden when he came home being he was 2 months early. He would sleep next to him and wake us when ever he moved so very cute. He is missed and will be for a very long time. Now about the scan it came back very good the spots are even smaller then the last one so that was good and nothing else has changed so good. The onc will keep am eye on things and I see her angain in 6 months for follow up and bloodwork. So things are getting better now we just need this rain to go away so I can get outside and have some fun in the dirt planting some stuff and getting at all the weeds. Boy they grow so fast lol.lol. I can't keep up with them I wish my flowers did as good. Oh well I am going to have to wait another day because it is raing again today. I am not going to weed in the rain and get even more achy.

breast_cancer_exchange,1927_0,"H! Went to scary oncologist number 1 yesterday and it went better than expected. He wasn't so scary this time - I think he has come to terms with me; I'm going to question things and do some research before I agree to a treatment. He told me why he preferred Femara over Arimidex, his points sounded valid, and I am now officially on it. I had labs drawn (tumor markers and metabolic panel) and will have a baseline bone density scan after Labor Day. Just hoping the Femara is kind to me as I've read about the possible side effects. Of course I recognize that every drug has them, so it's a matter of deciding what the risk/reward for your own situation. I already have osteoarthritis in both knees and will need to have replacements soon, I really don't want things to get worse. One thing I found - Femara is extremely expensive at about $400 a month. At www.femara.com you can find a coupon from Novartis that will cut your co-pay to $10 a month, until they have subsidized up to $800. So in my case, as an example, my insurance co-pay is about $200 for a 90 day supply. With the coupon, I will pay just $30. And since I need refills quarterly, my total annual out of pocket should be just $120. Hopefully, there is not some \unknown\"" element to this. It brings the price in line with generic Arimidex. If you are on Femara and wasn't aware of this coupon, you should definitely check it out. It's not valid for government health plans (like Medicare) but should work for any private plans.

As Judy said the test is most likely a core needle biopsy. 80% of the time they come back as benign which is not cancer so you have a very good chance that it is not cancer. From your posting here and asking about your wife I would say you are one of the very rare husbands. Your a kind hearted, caring and worried husband who is looking out for his wife in any way he can. I give you a lot of credit for that. But I also know right now you must be a basket of nerves with worring and wondering what all of this may mean. That is all normal feelings for you and your wife to have. You don't need to hide those feelings she is most likely feeling them also comfort each other and try to keep each other busy, a busy mind doing other things till the test will help. Maybe watch movies together, cook together, do something both of you enjoy that would keep your minds off of the test for a while. No need to worry about something untill you know for sure there is really something to worry about right?!

breast_cancer_exchange,2809_12,"Hi Jenna, I think all that bone pain is totally unacceptable!!!! With all the different meds out there you should NOT feel like you have arthritis. 5 yrs ago--- I was on Femera, Arimidex finally on Tamoxifen. (Which I kept throwing up). Also he had me on one other one which I can't remember. Then had a long debate with Old Onc when Evista was approved by FDA for breast ca patients. I think that was about '07. He did not want me to go on it at all. No reason just wanted to push the Tam. Evista was orginially made for osteoporsis which my Mother has severaly. I am pre-osteoporsis so I figured why not control 2 diseases with one pill. LOL. It worked so good---I had NO bone pain and felt wonderful on it. I have had arthritis for over 40 yrs. (Oh NO--- now I am dating myself). OOPS!!! So did not need anymore pain from taking other pills. That is about the time my Old Onc and I started to NOT communicate. He did not like me researching my disease and trying to convince him to as least let me try different meds my body could handle for the next 5 yrs. Now the ca I have has nothing to do with taking Evista or anything else but totally caused from the rads. Now ladies do not become alarmed as less than 1% of the population gets this. Radiation is a part of the breast cancer treatment and I would do it again as it cured me of breast cancer. So my suggestion to you, Jenna is ask your Dr to try you on other meds that you can tolerate. Judy is on Fareston.---it is expensive but she isn't having any problems with it. That is my suggestion to you and worth asking Dr about it. Why be in so much pain? With all we have to go thru to beat this disease, pain should not be in the treatment plan. O.K.

Now me I would have had my fake boob fall out from under my shirt right in front of him just to see the look on his face. Then I would have leaned over and had my wig fall off and acted like all of this was the worse thing that could have happened and left the room acting all upset. I would have to leave so I wouldn't laugh in his face. People that act like he did deserve something to happen to them and this would be great and a lot of fun lol. I am the prankster so leave it to me to think of something like this lol.... But that is what I would have done. Then maybe have lucky hide some of his things so that lucky can have some fun also. Then this guy has the nerve to install dish TV and not tell you that is wrong. Boy I would give them a very nice phone call and let them have and ear full for sure. That is probable why he wasn't to talkative with you because he was to busy being sneaky. I didn't plant a fall garden because my reg garden is still growing like crazy. Plus I have been so busy haven't really had time to plant anything. trying to get some stuff done around here before snow falls and while I have the help. Because I can't do it alone so have to get it done now. Which I don't mind the sooner the better then one less thing to have to think about getting done.

I hope it works in the or because I do not want o keep going in for surgery there is only so much a body can take. I think I have had enough. I am just waiting for the calls and see what they are going to do and dates. So we both took the long road but we will get there soon just have to stay strong and positive.

My paternal grandmother had bc, but we don't know the specs. Too long ago. It didn't come up as genetic for me wither. My cousin on that side got dx last dec.They did explain that just because the test comes back negative means you don't have a known braca gene. They keep studying and when they come up with a new match then they make a new brac (1,2,3,etc) discovery. I am worried about the growth hormone in beef, and dairy. But I guess they have stopped any hormones to disrupt. I read about a new drug that can stop your growth hormones (all of them. I guess they are many naturally) They are just through the mice tests. I hope they get to test this furthur. It has shown to stop cancer form growing. This rainy weather is yucky! I don't mind a day of rain, but not days! It is sunny and nice here this weekend.

breast_cancer_exchange,2318_2,"Ladies, Thank you both for answering me so promptly and thoroughly! Luckily only my breast hurt. My arm and armpit where the sentinel node incision was made do not hurt. I have been massaging the breast twice a day and the doctor said to wear a very supportive bra and approved the bra I showed her I was wearing. The breast never looked or felt different - it has always been soft and supple - and the doctor said it was just fluid in the breast when she exmined me. The pain has subsided to the point where I no longer need any Aleve and when I saw her this week she told me I can stop the ice packs if I wanted to. I was thinking that after I finished radiation I did not wear a bra as it was easier to deal with the burns and aloe and cornstarch etc. that way. I never had any problems moving my arm as I did exercises the day after my lumpectomy and the arm never swelled up. The armpit was not radiated either, just the breast which was done in the prone position (face down). In that position there was no way the armpit received radiation. However I did not wear a bra even when I was shoveling snow - here in NJ we received over 50\ of snow. I wonder if the breast hanging down unsupported while I shoveled might have caused the fluid retention since all this started last week - or was it just coincidental?. At any rate the breast is getting better, and I will watch it carefully and wear my bra at all times from now on to support the breast. I thank you both for your good wishes and advice - since I had never heard of this until I did research and found this could happen to some women at any time post radiation! This is not routinely mentioned as a side effect of radiation and nothing was said to me by my oncologist until I called her when it happenned. Thank you ladies, you are so wonderful and caring.

osteoporosis_exchange,409_0,"There are no medications currently approved for premenopausal women. I'm curious about your diagnosis of diagnosis at this time. Are you nursing? Pregnancy and nursing can deplete the bone mass, but it usually regains that loss when nursing stops. Has he done any tests on you to determine the cause of the bone loss? Osteoporosis in premenopausal woman is often secondary to something else going on. The Vit D recommendation is currently 1000 IU per day, so you're right on target there. I would ask to have my levels checked at your next appointment though. It may be that you need a prescription booster dose. The 2400 mg of calcium seems somewhat high unless there's something else going on. Because the body can only absorb 500-600 mg at a time, actually getting 2400 can be difficult. The recommendation is about 1000-1200 mg per day. Talk to your doctor a little more or talk to another doctor - maybe your ob/gyn now that you have some more information. Also you can research this on the National Osteo Foundation website (www.nof.org ) for a lot of reliable info.",1.3,4.9,P
osteoporosis_exchange,418_0,"First let me clear up something for you. You have gone through menopause. You are postmenopausal. If you've gone one year without a period, you are postmenopausal. That means that your ovaries are not producing estrogen. That combined with your eating disorder depletes calcium from the bones. You should be looking at T-scores instead of Z-scores. You definitely need the calcium and Vitamin D. You also need an osteo med. You are waaaaay too young to have to deal with fractures. Because you've had one fracture that alone puts you at double the risk for another. Fractures impact quality of life. With osteoporosis, they heal very slowly and often irregularly. Birth control pills will help, but you need more. You can do that and something else. I doubt that your bone density will ever be in the normal range, but you can hold off fracturing. I would suggest a couple of things. First I'd go online to the National Osteoporosis Foundation website (www.nof.org ) and order their booklet \Boning Up on Osteoporosos.\"" It's $6.50 and gives you all kinds of reliable information. We use it in teaching our osteo rehab classes. There's also other info available for patients on the site. Play around with it and get informed - especially their official statements about use of the osteo meds. Next, I'd research the meds and with your doctor, choose one. You can't escape it and expect to lead a fracture free life. Diet and exercise help, but with scores that low and one fracture under your belt, only meds will do what you want to happen. My personal suggestion for you, with your absorption complications and hesitancies, would be Reclast. That's the annual IV med. It gets very good results in patients. You could do this and birth control pills. I'd also get some instruction on proper body mechanics. The booklet gives you some info, but a physical therapist can assess you individually and really help. There are some definite \""no, no's\"" you should be aware of. It's good that you're this young and taking charge. You've a lot of years ahead and you want to be independenet and active.""",2.2,5.3,P

Make sure you're taking 1200 mg of calcium each day, 600 with 2 meals for best absorption. Also you need 2000 IU of Vit D to send the calcium to the bones.

It's the spine - don't bend from it. It's the repetitive movements of the spine that put pressure on those little bones inside the vertebrae that will break with no pain. When the last one within the vertebra breaks, bam, you have a compression fracture. I wouldn't use the vibrator with your numbers. Too much pounding or pressure on the spine could cause damage.

It's very difficult to make healthcare decisions, especially for another person, when you really don't know what's best and have to trust in others. The internet, while a wonderful resource, can also cloud the issues and is well known to impart incorrect information. First I will tell you that I agree with your mother's rheumatologist. We have never seen a number in our osteoporosis center as low as -7.1. Your mom has some significant roadblocks in her quest for stronger bones. I don't think Reclast is going to do much for her at this point. It's a bisphosphanate just like Fosamax/Actonel/Boniva. Those drugs do not build bone. They make the bone you have stronger. When bone is as \holey\"" as your mom's, even strengthening that bone leaves a lot of holes. The Forteo is the ONLY drug that grows new bone. Are you certain it is what caused the high blood calcium level or is that an assumption? If it wasn't conclusively shown to be the Forteo, I'd put her back on it. Does she have other health issues? Why does she weigh so little? Is she mostly sedentary? The more weight she can put on her bones, the more likely they are to be stimulated to grow. By that I mean, if she can stand or walk, even around the house, it'll help. People who are bedridden or sit in a recliner all day lose bone mass very quickly. You say she's religious about the calcium and Vit D. Does she get 1200 mg a day in calcium, taken hours apart? If she has gastro problems, she may not be absorbing the calcium like she should. I'd suggest a liquid form taken with each meal. Also the Vit D needs to be 1000 IU a day. It can be taken at any time. If her calcium has Vit D in it, don't worry about her getting too much. Get the 1000 IU supplement and start her on it. So, to sum up, investigate the Forteo again. Get her on her feet as much as possible. Get a liquid calcium supplement and have her take it with each meal. Start her on a 1000 IU Vit D routine. If the Forteo is really not an option, then I'd do the Reclast and continue wtih the same above recommendations.

osteoporosis_exchange,254_1,"Hi BearsFan, Have you had your testosterone levels checked? What were your Z-scores? Just FYI, a diagnosis of osteoporosis is not given to a male under the age of 50. Z-scores are used instead of T-scores to get an idea of your bone density. Also, at 31, you could possibly still be accumulating bone mass and have not reached your peak mass. That's one reason we don't do testing on young people unless there's an underlying reason to do so. Pain isn't usually a reason. For men, it's normally low testosterone (can be caused by some meds like Depakote or by heavy drinking during bone forming years), steroid use or some other high risk med like antiseizure meds or chemo. I understand that your doctor suspected a compression fracture and that's probably why he ordered a DXA. I'm sorry you're having so much pain and I hope you get answers/solutions soon. As for the steroid shots....the risk is when the dose is greater than 5 mg for greater than 3 months. A single shot here and there won't affect your bone density.",1.8,5.1,P

osteoporosis_exchange,46_0,"Many of our patients can't take calcium supplements for one reason or another. Constipation is the most common reason. Anger is a new one. I'll tell you what we tell them, then. First, make sure it's the calcium causing you to feel this way and not something else going on. Best way to do this is food records. Try noting how you take the calcium (with or without food and if with, which food - it could be a combo deal). Also which calcium. Lots of calciums have add on ingredients and it could be one of those. I'd suggest trying something simple like Tums and see what happens. Take it after a meal. Leave off the supplements with zinc, magnesium or oyster shell calcium. See what happens, then document it. This would be good to show your doctor. If that fails, you'll need to get it from diet alone. This requires a good bit of diligence because you need 1200 mg a day and the body will only aborb about 500-600 mg at a time. So....what that means is that you'll need to spread it out thru the day. If you look at the National Osteoporosis Foundation website (www.nof.org) you can find a list of commn foods that contain calcium. Also you'll need to become savvy when reading food labels. Many foods today have calcium added, so look for it. A hint here - if you see it listed in a %, such as 25% daily calcium requirement, that's 250 mg. Simple change the % into a zero, and you'll have the mg. number you need. Also, it's important for you to get at least 1000 IU of Vit D along with the calcium. This is what sends the calcium to the bones. You can take it in the form of a single pill at any time during the day. Don't rely on the sun for what you need daily - unless you're under 50 and live below Atlanta. You won't get the necessary amount. Better to take the supplement. Hope this helps with your problem.

osteoporosis_exchange,52_2,"It can get confusing because the market's hot for calcium now. There are really only two kinds that we recommend - calcium citrate and calcium carbonate. We strongly urge all patients to forego the coral calcium - a marketing gimmick. The calcium citrate is easier to tolerate for those who have problems with constipation and/or gas. However, you need to read the label closely because it's usually 2 tablets are = one dose. You'd need to take 4 tablets/day. The calcium carbonate can be in a single tablet form to take twice a day. The biggest problem with calcium is abosrption, so if you can get a form that you can chew up (Tums) or a liquid you can be sure that's it's dissolving in your stomach. I personally like the generic Viactive chews. There's even a chewing gum but you have to chew 8 pieces a day and it can get quite expensive. One thing to remember about calcium is that it's a mineral and cannot be broken down; therefore, calcium is calcium. Price does not figure into effectiveness. No need to go to the health food stores for a special kind. One is no better than the other. The main consideration is what your stomach can tolerate.

osteoporosis_exchange,105_2,"When we have patients who have low bone density and no apparent reason for it, our medical director recommends that they have a 24 hour urine test to see how much calcium they're excreting.

But...even though you're doing everything according to the rules, you aren't guaranteed strong bones. Too many other factors go into play here - the biggest being age, estrogen and genetics. The longer you live, the more likely your bones will thin, especially if you never reached your maximum density. I am suspicious of anyone who would tell a person she had the bones of a 30, 40, 50 whatever year old. That simply is not an accurate statement. The data base on which a DXA is performed is based on a healthy 20 year old. We've had plenty of young (less than 50) people come through our osteoporosis center with low bone density. Anybody who tells you your bones compare arbitrarily with a certain age person is giving you a false impression and, in my opinion, acting irresponsibly.

Just right off the top of my head, without knowing the answers to these questions, I'd avise you to change the running to walking. Running pounds the spine and can cause small struts within the vertebrae to break without you having a clue until the last one (the honeycomb looking bone) breaks. Then you have a compression fracture and boy, will you know it! Walking gives you the same benefit without the pounding and you don't sweat as much. Sweating causes you to excrete calcium.

Your body will absorb about 500-600 mg at a time so spread it out throughout the day. Read your labels. Many foods now have calcium added and it's shown as a %. To see how many mg a % is, drop the % and add a 0. Ex: 25% = 250 mg. Take a multivitamin. You also need to get 1000 IU of Vit D a day.

osteoporosis_exchange,242_6,"Hi John, I think I can answer some of your questions about Forteo. I don't have a website like your asking about, but I do have patient feedbackk from our own patients. First, Forteo is the big guns of osteoporosis treatment. There is nothing better. It's the only med that formulates new bone. Because bone is slow to respond to treatment, testing is usually done after 2 years. If you've shown a 5% increase in less time than that, that is astounding progress. Depending on the results of the DXA technician's precision test, a signficant increase (or decrease) should be noted in a percentage. At our osteoporosis center, a signficant change is anything greater than 2.9%. So...if you've increased 5%, that's significant. Ask your technician what % their precision study showed to be significant. Following the 2 year course of treatment, you should go on a bisphosphanate like Reclast/Actonel/Boniva/Fosamax to strengthen the new bone. Be sure to consume 1200 mg of calcium and 1000 IU of Vit. D with any osteo meds. If you don't, you're not giving the medications anything to work with and they won't be as effective. As for your joint pain, my guess (and it's purely a guess) is that it's arthritis of some sort, especially since you report more pain in the morning. I've had no reports from patients of pain associated with Forteo. An x-ray would show arthritis or arthritic changes. Unfortunately that comes with aging to all of us who live long enough. As I've said many times on this board - there is no magic bullet and there is no medication without side effects. You have to weigh your own personal medical and family history with the known side effects of a medication and determine if the perceived risk is worth it. Even natural remedies come with risk. Forteo is a good drug. It works wonders for people. On a personal note, it enabled my 85 year old uncle to stand upright, without a walker, after years of being so crippled and in pain he couldn't attend his own son's funeral.

osteoporosis_exchange,664_0,"I suspect you've had some compression fractures with your history and curvature of the spine. Before you go for your DXA, ask your doctor if he's ordered a VFA (vertebral fracture assessment) along with your DXA. Then ask if your testing facility does them. Most places do now. It will give you a lateral view of your entire spine and pick up on any compression fractures. Radiation and chemo are big hazards to bone density. It's one of the negatives of cancer treatment. My mother went through the same thing. I would tell you like I told her, don't stop your osteo med. They do reduce your chances of fracturing and your chances are doubled for having more fractures now that you've had one or more. As for the radiation from the DXA - it's less than going through security at an airport. You'd have to have 32 DXA's to equal one chest x-ray. Very low dose.

It was also done in a single area, not broadly based. It also has not been proven or accepted by medical professionals and statements are generalized. It also stated that if a patient did not need the medicines, she was better off not taking them. That's their CYA statement. Bone is very slow to respond to change - whether starting or stopping a medication. It is laughable to think that within only a few months of starting a drug someone could tell the results and implications of it. Besides, IF you should have some jaw bone necrosis (and this is very rare) the bone WILL grow back, but slowly. The fact is, if you are at risk for fracture, the consequences of that are much graver than any perceived threat of jaw necrosis. We had a patient who listened to pap like this and stopped her medication. Said she \felt like my bones are strong,\"" and would self treat \""naturally.\"" Well, she slipped on some loose rock, fell and broke her arm. OK, she thought, just my arm. Put a cast on it and be inconvenienced for a while. Nope. Didn't turn out that way. After weeks and weeks of being in a cast, the arm wasn't healing. Surgery was done to insert hardware. This hardware actually protruded from her harm. Very painful and very difficult to maintain her lifestyle (think showers and dressing and driving) with this hardware. Then she had to have surgery to remove the hardware and another cast put on the keep the arm steady while completing recovery. More weeks of inconvenience. She had a total of 9 months of being without the use of her arm and then had physical therapy to strengthen it. After all that guess what the doctor did with her endorsement? Put her on Actonel! Maybe if she'd not listened to alarmist articles and horror stories based on fear, not fact, she could've avoided this break in the first place.

Was bent over almost at a 90 degree angle. Could not walk, but could scoot across the floor. Terrific pain. Had to sleep in a recliner. When his son died, he was unable to attend the funeral. My father sat with him at the house during the time of the funeral. They lived in Columbia, SC at the time. The capital city of SC with lots of medical resources. Not one doctor ever addressed this problem. I believe because they thought he was too far gone and so old. He was 89 at the time. I brought him up to our osteoporosis center in NC. He had 2 kyphoplasty procedures and began Forteo shots. In two days he was walking upright with the help of a cane. He died this past February at the age of 96 - NEVER having had another fracture. He told me over and over again how thankful he was for the Forteo which gave him a wonderful quality of life until he died. I think people get so hung up on reading the side effects without really researching them (the cancer from Forteo was in lab rats and even then, not all lab rats. But Lilly was obligated to report that) that they overlook the difference a drug can make in their lives. Especially with a disease like osteoporosis where, until you fracture, it doesn't seem real. I'm also guessing that because you had an eating disorder in your teens, you never reached your maximum bone mass and when you started slowing down your estrogen production, your bone density quickly decreased. If you never build it up and don't have much to start with, it's a no brainer to realize that when your bones do start to thin, your's will go faster. That's one reason we preach to our patients about making sure their children and grandchildren are doing all they can to build up their bone mass. Now the peak age is 21 instead of the 35 it was when I was growing up. With all medications,you have to look at your personal history and genetic makeup and decide if the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks. People on prednisone are a good example. Prednisone makes you crazy, makes you puff up, annihilates your bones, causes insomnia and food cravings - and yet - it saves lives and/or makes life tolerable. There's nothing without risk. Nothing. How many times have you taken an antibiotic knowing that you'd get a yeast infection? But you still take the antibiotic. Same with osteo drugs. People die from fractures. People lose independence because of fractures. People can't pick up children or have sex with spouses because of fractures. People fracture doing gardening, getting in and out of cars and sometimes doing nothing. If your risk of fracture is great, take the drug.",1.9,4.2,P

My implants weren't due to bone loss in the jaw. They were needed for various reasons not directly osteoporosis-related, e.g. fractured roots, not enough retention which caused crowns to keep falling out, etc. Many of the problems were due to ill-fitting crowns, where bacteria leaked in and weakened the tooth or caused decay; then the tooth broke off level with the gumline, and consequently the crowns just didn't want to stay on.

Your hip is normal (barely) and your spine is in the osteopenic range (barely) - so I'd think you could boost those numbers with calcium and Vit D. What is going to impact that more than the calcium and D is your menopausal status and the use or nonuse of hormones. If you've recently been through menopause and are not on hormones, your numbers are going to drop regardless of the calcium/D. If you're on hormones your numbers may increase. If you've been through menopause for some years and not on hormones, you may be pretty stable right now. The thing is, as you age, your risk increases, especially if you're not on hormones.

You'll just have to see if the Tums alone will alleviate your heartburn. They might. As for getting too much calcium, it's very difficult to do because your body can only absorb abut 500-600 mg at a time and you'd have to really really be diligent about taking it throughout the day to get too much.

I did notice that on the Terms and Conditions that it states several times that this is information for general use and should not be considered medical advice. The thing about osteopenia that's tricky is that it's a broad classification for a description of the current of your bones. That is to say, it covers a wide area. Someone with a T-score of -1.1 is defined as having osteopenia as well as someone with a T-score of -2.4. While they are both osteopenis, there is a world of difference in their status. It is entirely possible to elevate a high osteopenia score to within normal range. When dealing with the lower end of the spectrum, diet and exercise alone can be risky. Especially when it takes at least 2 years to measure any change. With Ilikepigs being premenopausal and having a low osteopenia T-score (technically she should be looking at Z-scores because of her premenopausal stage and, therefore, there is no osteopenia/osteoporosis classification) she's at much higher risk of bone loss than a postmenopausal woman with a T-score of -1.3 or so. Her density will plummet when she goes through menopause and natural methods of dealing with this are not enough.

If your T-score is already into the osteoporosis range, you can be assured that it will drop even lower when you are completely menopausal.

Might be worth trying. With a spine and hip in peril, no side effect of a medication is worse that having these areas fracture. That can instantly alter your life. With a vertebral fracture you become bent over, doubling your chances of having another fracture and enduring tremendous pain - and there's no correcting it. Hip fractures steal your independence.

Walking, not running, is excellent for the bones as is dancing, tai chi or anything done on your feet. What you want to watch is anything that twists the spine or any repeated forward bending of the spine. That puts pressure on the spine which over time will lead to fractures. Of course, falling is always an issue. It's the single biggest of fractures. Duh! As young to middle age adults we tend to fall forward, that's why we see broken wrists as we fling out our arms to break the fall. As we age, we fall backwards, breaking hips. Any fall from a standing position (even slipping on hard ice as we've heard many times) is considered a nontraumatic fracture and is a huge red flag. If you're on Forteo and your bone density, even in one site, is low, I would really really be hesitant to continue running. There are just too many risks invovled.

When you reach a certain point, the only proven method is pharmacological intervention. I understand and appreciate your reluctance because of your sensitivity. However, your numbers are very low and you have a strong family history in a first degree relative. Your HRT will help, but you need to talk to your doctor. The medical community agrees that at this point, there is no \natural\"" proven way to rebuild bone and that the risks of fracture far far outweigh any side effects from the drugs.

Speaking of hip fractures, the statistics are that one in two women over the age of 50 will have an osteoporotic fracture during her lifetime. Of those, half will die from complications of the fracture within a year of fracturing. At 50, you're young enough to rebound from a fracture, but it could still impact your life significantly. You saw what your father went through. I can't think of any risk of any osteo med currently available that would be worse than that. Go to the National Osteoporosis Foundation website, (www.nof.org ) and look at the patient information on medications as well as their official statements about the side effects/risks of those medications. On a personal note, and this is only my own opinion, if I were in your situation, I would run to get my prescription filled, probably do the Reclast.

I know most people would like to combat illness/disease/injury on their own, but sometimes it's just not going to work. There are risks with the drugs as with any drug or supplement. But..the drugs do work. What happens is this: your body builds bone and takes away bone. As we age, the taking away remains the same while the building slows down. That causes the bones to thin. What the drugs do is slow down the reabsorption process, giving the bone building cells time to build new bone. If you already have osteoporosis and your body continues to discard bone faster than it builds it, you really should consider taking a medication. Calcium, Vitamin D and exercise will not change this ratio. The thing about osteoporosis is that you don't feel anything. There's no way to know what shape your bones are in by the way you feel or move. Only a DXA can tell you that....unless you fracture. Then you know. That's when the hindsight kicks in.

These tests, when used properly and with an understanding of the results interpretation, can be valuable tools. They are not diagnostic, they are designed to be used on women ages 40-65 and are a once in a lifetime test. The goal of this screening is to see if a person who doesn't present with any reason to have a DXA shows a score low enough to warrant one. They are not sensitive to be used as followup testing.

Technically speaking no diagnosis is given to premenopausal women, but I suspect she's either peri or postmenopausal. If she's still having even spotty periods, she can expect her bone density to get even a little lower as her body stops producing estrogen.

If so, your bone density could always have been low because of low dietary calcium intake during your growing years or genetics or meds you may have taken in the past. When we measure people for the first time and they have low bone density (osteopenia) we don't know if they've always been low or if they're losing. The only way to get this information is to have another DXA in 2 years. If you are indeed losing (usually a difference of about 3% or more is measurable) then it would be time to take further steps to stop the process. You are quite correct to take more Vitamin D. The new recommendations call for 1000 IU of it each day and some professionals are now advising 2000 IU. As for the calcium, you need 1200 mg each day. Since the body only absorbs about 500-600 mg at a time, spread it out. Don't cram it all in each a.m. and think you're good for the day. You'll just excrete the excess in your urine. You don't say how old you are, but if you're still in childbearing years, you might consider taking the birth control pill. It does help protect the bones. If you are taking or have taken the Depo Provera shot for birth control, that depletes bone mass quickly. Hope this gives you some information you wanted. Beth",2.5,6.1,P
osteoporosis_exchange,889_0,"You're too funny I wish I did get paid by someone other than the hospital where I work. I'm sorry that you thought my reply was harsh. It certainly wasn't meant to be. I deal in realities in my profession. We see about 4000 patients a year in various stages of bone health. Not one, not a single one, has reversed her bone density if it was below -2.0 by the use of natural means alone. Not one! To me the repercussions of low bone density are harsh. People die from fractures. There are medications that are proven to reduce their risk of having these fractures. I still maintain that for someone who is not a specialist in osteoporosis, who does not know an individual's personal health situation, but who does have a prejudice against medications to attempt to sway someone from taking a med that could possibly allow them to lead a fracture free life is irresponsible. The femur fractures you mention do occur to people taking bisphosphonates. They also occur with the same frequency to people who do not. To date there has been no verified correlation between the meds and these particular fractures. The health professionals are stumped by them. The lawsuits also are much publicized. The lawyers see a potential windfall ($) for them in bringing class action suits. Again, there has been no result of these. None has gone to court and no determination of culpability has been determined. Osteopenia always leads to osteoporosis? No, it doesn't. There are many women who have low bone density all their lives who never develop osteoporosis. On the other hand, there are women who have normal bone density according to their scores, but who break a hip or vertebra. This gives them a clinical diagnosis of osteoporosis. Gwyneth Paltrow is not relevant because she is under age 50. She is still producing estrogen that protects her bones to a degree. (No diagnosis is given to premenopausal women or men under 50 unless their low bone density is secondary to another health condition.) Certainly she needs to do what she can to make them strong. Her weight is a huge factor that she chooses not to change. If there were a magic diet that would reverse osteoporosis, we would be all over it. That would be wonderful news. The same as it would be for any other illness that requires medication. Taking meds is the pits. No one wants to do it. But I'm glad it's there if we need it. And, just to clarify my position by working in a hospital - we neither recommend nor prescribe medication. Only the patient's doctor can do that. We test, educate, rehabilitate and support. p.s. Remember I also said that I couldn't get the site to open up. Maybe you could share some of the highlights of their thinking. I'd be interested to know.",2.5,4.9,F

I can tell you without qualification, that those who choose to avoid the medications do not bring those scores up to anywhere near normal or \safe\"" levels. The Forteo is truly a miracle drug, and if your doctor is advising you to have a course of treatment, I strongly suggest you listen to him. Diet and exercise are very important to your bone health and without them, the medications won't be successful. However there are times and circumstances where diet and exercise alone just aren't enough. We are very fortunate to have the option now of medications that have been proven to reduce fractures. When something isn't broken or bleeding or causing us pain, it's sometimes not real to us. Couple that with horror stories of medication side effects and the temptation to go the natural only route is strong. For some people, that's OK, but with those T-scores and whatever other risks you might have, you aren't one of them. The osteo drugs are getting a lot of headline press right now about possible side effects and people love to tell their own stories of suffering. But by far, the benefits outweigh the risks. The fact is that 1 in 2 women over the age of 50 will have a hip fracture. Half of those people having an osteoporotic hip fracture will die within one year of that fracture from complications. That would scare me more than any of the talked about side effects of any osteo medication. That doesn't even take into consideration the loss of independence and lifestyle changes that come with hip and spine fractures. All medications and supplements have risks and side effects. All of them. Natural doesn't always equal safe. My neighbor died from an unknown peanut allergy and peanuts are certainly natural. There's a bad feeling against \""big pharm\"" and there's also a supposition that those of us who work in the medical field are in the pockets of big pharm. I work in a hospital and we never see a drug rep. We also don't prescribe medications. We do DXA testing and prepare a report with our findings which goes to the referring doctor. He then talks with his patient about what's best for that individual. They then make a treatment decision. I don't mean to go off on my soapbox, but it is very frustrating to those of us who see these women day in and day out who really need to take a medication that could save them a lot of grief and pain and they're swayed by irresponsible press and gotcha headlines.

osteoporosis_exchange,932_0,"You're right to be concerned about fracturing. You appear to be at high risk, with osteoporotic T-scores and small frame. The purpose of any osteoporosis medication is not to bring your T-scores up. Many people are under that assumption and think the T-score tells the whole story. It doesn't. You say you were on Fosamax 7 years with no apparent benefit. What your clinician needs to look at is your BMD, not T-score, and if that has increased or decreased significantly (based on your testing center's precision study). That is how you determine gain or loss. Not by looking at a difference in a T-score. If you haven't decreased in bone mass more than the LSC (lowest significant change) again, as determined by your testing center's precision study, you are considered to be stable. That's a good thing. Increase is always good, but no loss is just as reassuring. I'm wondering if you consumed 1200 mg of calcium a day, taken in 2-3 doses several hours apart for maximum absorption? If you don't take the needed calcium, the medications don't have anything to work with. It can make or break the effectiveness of any medication. I'm sorry you had the vertigo with the Forteo. If you absolutely cannot take it, I'd go with the Prolia. It's a different type drug. All drugs have side effects. Every one. Often it's necessary to take another medication to control side effects so that you can benefit from the primary drug that is helping your particular situation. This is more common than not with all medications. If your doctor can prescribe you something for the dizziness, I'd try the Forteo again. It is the big guns of osteoporosis treatment and it's relatively short term with a two year end date. Just from my personal experience (and we see about 4000 patients a year) I've not heard of anyone having vertigo that was isolated to Forteo. I'll specifically ask any I may see coming in for appointments. Usually they are quick to point out troubles they are having, and I'm sure someone would've mentioned it.

osteoporosis_exchange,619_1,"Hi Deb I work in an osteoporosis center. I see first hand every day how a hip or compression fracture can instantly alter the lives of many women (and men). All it takes is one slip, a hug too hard, picking up a grandchild, the wrong move when planting flowers, etc. Then there's the loss of independence - driving - maybe you can't live alone any longer. Not to mention the pain and subsequent surgery (ies). There's no going back once these fractures occur. Would I take a drug that has been proven to reduce my risk of fracturing? You bet I would. In a heartbeat. I see women with wrist fracture that won't heal. With pins that slip out. With secondary infections. Round after round of antibiotics and doctor visits. Having to get transportation to these appointments. The side effects of these drugs are minimal compared to the results of a fracture. When your bone density is at a certain level and/or you have other risk factors for fracture involved, a medication is the only way to increase your bone strength.

osteoporosis_exchange,596_0,"There have been some good posts on the subject of premenopausal on this board. Look at some of them, particularly by Susan Allison for some information. First of all, if you're premenopausal, you should be looking at Z-scores, not T-scores. And there is no diagnosis given to premenopausal women. However, with a score as low as -4.1, your Z-score won't be much higher. This is a pretty significantly low number. Osteoporosis is defined as having a T-score at -2.5 or lower. Secondly, did your doctor say anything about testing you to find the cause of this? The endo would be a good start. Also if he could find a reason for your low bone density (osteoporosis as secondary) your insurance company might be more inclined to pay for treatment. Look at the ISCD (International Society of Clinical Densitometrists) website (www.iscd.org ) to find an expert near you. It may take some navigating the website, but that info is there. As for the Forteo, no testing has been done on its effectiveness past 2 years. After the 2 years of treatment, you would followup with a bisphosphanate like Actonel, Fosamax, Reclast to strengthen the new bone. As far as I know, there's no optimal time to take it.

The Fortical nasal spray isn't going to be enough for you, I don't think. Has your internist talked about Forteo? It's the daily injection (small) of parathyroid hormone and is the only medication that will grow new bone. You do it for 2 years, then take a bisphosphanate to strengthen the new bone. In your case, with the IBS, I'd recommend Reclast. As for the jaw death - your risk of having a vertebral fracture (if you haven't already) greatly exceeds your risk of jaw death. Everybody who has jaw death (and the numbers are relatively few) is not on a bisphosphanate, and everybody on a bisphosphanate does not experience necrosis. There are a lot of factors that go into play other than the drug. You need to have your bone density tests done at the same place each time and talk to your doctor about Forteo and Reclast. Also as for your exercise, do not do any exercises that involve twisting of the spine, forward bends or crunches.

alzheimers_exchange,18_1,"Hi, I'm also new to this site. I'm reading of things so familiar that I wasn't sure was AD myself. My mother-n-law has also been diagnosed with Alzheimer's/dementia. The first things we saw with her was her inability to handle her finances and not wanting to bath. She gradually was giving up on everything. She use to be a great cook and she gave up on that. Just sat and let everyone wait on her even before she started getting forgetful. We took over her finances, writing her checks, etc..and we would tell her how much she had left over. She would go to a teller and if she saw money, she would take it out causing checks to bounce. My husband had to get a power of attorney for her finances and her medical power of attorney. My MIL doesn't even want to make decisions-not even simple ones. You are going to have to do this if you are going to be the primary caregiver ASAP. My MIL lives with us. She will tell us she has done things like her exercises when she hasn't. She will tell things \secretly\"" to visitors about us and we are going to put her in a home. I sometimes see her as manipulative and trying to get attention, she has been that way as long as I have known her but it's much worse now that she is having memory problems. My MIL carries on normal converasations but has problems with short-term memory, dates, etc...however, she seems to be different with other people than us. We have to beg her to do things she will do for visitors willing...such as asking to go to the bathroom. My MIL doesn't want to get up out of her chair to go to the bathroom unless we make her. She knows to do it, she tells us she knows when she has to, she had rather, in her own words...wait until meal time to do it all in one trip. She wears Depends & wets them.They can come off lazy, stubborn and passive agressive. We were told from the beginning that lack of intiative was a very big part of Alzheimers/dementia and a lot of her problem comes from that. The problem we have is that she has always been lazy & wanted others to do things for her so the line is very fine. But so much of what you have described is definitely AD. I feel your pain. I feel the anger and resentment also. I quit my job to stay home and help her...moved her in with us. She does as little as she can get by with, but when we really push her, she will do it. It's not a matter that she can't...at least right now. I'm sure it will get to the point she can't. It's very hard seeing how different she can be with others and do for them but will not for us, the very ones who care for her and have sacrificed our family life for her. WE have 3 children and we cannot even go out to eat together or to church because someone always has to be with her. She acts so unappreciative at times and I feel very taken advantage of. I keep telling myself some of this is the dementia but I also feel, especially in the beginning stages that she uses it as a free pass to not do anything. Your mom will have to have round the clock care and will either have to move in with someone or go to a facility. My MIL was supposedly taking her meds till we went into her home one day and she had dropped her weekly pill box and jumbled up all the medicine and was just taking whatever she put back in the box. At least, she will have to be prompted to do a lot of simple things taken for granted. At times we have to tell my MIL everystep to take , to back up to the chair before she sits or she will just take short cuts & fall onto the floor. I'm sorry to say it will not get better. My MIL was given Aricept about 3 years before she had to move in with us. She is now on Aricept at night & Namenda twice a day. She's still not as bad as most. She recognizes most people & takes with sense most of the time. Right now her lack of iniative and getting dates confused is the worse part. So I'm afraid you have some crucial decisions to make &sounds like very soon. Good Luck and you are not alone.""",2.7,3.5,P

I had a 12:00 noon appt. for a massage and a 12:30 hair appt. I had just enough time to get my husband home from lunch and get to that appt. Before I could reach home, my 12 yr old granddaughter called from school with a headache and wanted medicine. so I took her some. I arrived in time for a hair appt.

She had a little irritation for a day or two after, but no pain. She was so thrilled with the results -- at 83, she only needs classes for fine print, too.

Ken usually remembers things that happen at night. Sometimes he won't mention it for 2 or 3 days, but lately, he tells me the next day. Do you mean that a person with AD does not remember what he says or does the next morning? I'm sure Ken won't want a urinal. He usually gets up with no problem. The bathroom is a few feet away from him. I read about Lewy body dementia. It seems very strange. In the past, Ken has acted out his dreams by hitting, kicking, yelling. When he did hit me, he didn't have any power behind the punch. It just woke me. I could usually tell when it was coming on by his jerking and twitching. The next morning he would tell me what he was doing, or maybe I was doing something in his dream. We discussed this with his doctor and he said there was nothing that can be done about it. Ken has not acted out his dreams since he retired and doesn't live a stressful life. Also if something really worried him, he may carry that to his dream and act it out.

Sometimes people get upset at supposed happy occasions. Your mother had alot of stimulation, and it may have been too much for her to process. If some sad feelings emerged during the celebration, you mother's unconscious memory, which remains throughout the disease, may have registered upset and although she cannot remember why she was and is upset, the feelings are there. Combativeness is a way she is expressing her feelings. Acknowledge how upset she is, and that you are so sorry she is upset. Do this not because you are the cause of her reaction, but rather to validate that she feels this way. She should start feeling better soon.

alzheimers_exchange,36_5,"Yes it helps! Thanks. My MIL is in 4/5 more into 5 now. She's still changing herself, clothes, pull up Depends. However, I have the problem with the heavy wet Depends also. She doesn't want to go to the bathroom to change. I\ve shown her how wet they were and how unsanitary it is. Doesn't sink in! She does't ask what day it is, she doesn't ask for food, drink, bathroom, nothing! I guess I should count my blessings she is not loud or demanding, sometimes doing nothing is just as bad. It leaves me to \""think\"" for her even though she is capable of doing that now. If she can ask her visitors for something she needs, even telling them what she wants to eat, almost everytime someone comes to visit...usually a sister, close friend ,daughter/granddaughter on occassion, why won't she ask me? I've made myself available to her and so has my husband, we've told her it makes us feel good/needed for her to tell us what she needs but she will just sit, do nothing, but watch tv and when we get on her for not asking she just says \""I don't want to bother anybody\""but she knows saying that BOTHERS US! But she will \""bother\"" others. If she didn't have the ability to do it, she wouldn't do it for them either. She even does the same with my 12 year old. Asks things of her to get for her when she should be asking an adult. That's why I said she acts passive agressive towards us. She has always said she wanted to live with us years ago before she had to. I really think she don't like it is because we insist she do things for herself we know she can do. She would get snappy with the therapist and home health aide that came temporarily when they would have her do what they KNEW she could do. She would love to be brought her meals and not have to go to the table, if we would dress & bath her every morning and baby her she would love it! Which we refuse to do for her own good. She does very well with that. She acts as if she wants to be treated \""sick\""...if she is \""well\"" she is expected to do more than she wants!!!! The therapist & aide even said so. They are use to dealing with AD patients & her stages and her attitude & what she could do didn't match. So I'm dealing with some laziness and pity. She has ALWAYS sat back & let others do things she should have done. Even would bribe grandkids with a couple of dollars to clean her bathroom when she was well. Now add AD in the mix-we feel like pulling our hair out sometimes!!! Needless to say, I feel very taken advantage of. When I quit my job 2 years ago, and she was much better. She would not tell us even then what she needed, unless it benefited what she \""wanted\"" like the TV if it lost programming. I was at work. I only worked part-time but had that job for 7 years. She was able to be left by herself a few hrs., would talk on the phone, do her own thing. she needed help with her meds & she was having falling spells now & again from spinal compression. She sat home 2 hours vomiting every 15 min., cold sweats, couldn't stand. My son came home & found her & she didn't want him to call me or my husband at work. He did. Turns out she had an intestinal blockage & could have died. CCU for a week. That's when I had to quit my job. Couldn't rely on her to call us for help/she wouldn't. It isn't all AD-- She was thrilled I quit my job to \""take care of her'. I was devasted! That frame of mind is still what we are dealing with along with the AD-it's merging. She has always wanted to be \""taken care of\"" at whoevers expense. I have so many feelings toward her good and bad..and I'm her daugher in law.

Yes, it has it's rewarding side, but way too often it's over shadowed by the stress of it all, especially when we don't have help or $ to get help and we are in the trenches alone. Even worse when even encouraging words from family and friends are hard to come by. A few try to give well meaning advice but normal advice for normal people don't work with AD.

This morning around 10:00 a very good friend of his (basically, his girlfriend) called and said she had spoken with my dad and we was ranting about leaving the ALF, getting his car back and going and living with the bums on the street if he had to. Last night one of his nurses checked his blood glucose readings as they do every evening and it was 395. He is a long-time diabetic on insulin. She said they would be calling his doctor at the VA for direction, but he needed to be eating less goodies. My dad has been walking to the Dollar General a block away and buying cookies and candy bars and eating them all in one day. My dad told his girlfriend that he yelled at the girl and was going to have her fired, told her that reading was wrong, and made her leave his apartment. I called and talked to the nurse on duty and she said his sugar was definitely dangerously high, but there was no altercation with the nurse. I finally called and talked to my dad and he was very calm. I told him I had spoken with his nurse and that he needed to stop eating the goodies and work with them to get is sugar down. He fully agreed, said he did not think he ate that many cookies but would stop buying them. I said that with sugar that high he should just relax in his apartment for a few days and we would not go to church tomorrow. He fully agreed to that as well. He said he loved me, I said I loved him and we said goodbye. My dad does have an order from the doctor to give him more Ativan (anti-anxiety med) if needed and I think that is what happened to calm him down.

You've seen what a huge toll caregiving can take when you don't pay enough attention to your own needs. Don't continue that cycle. Please make an appointment to talk to your doctor right away. Have you ever been part of an Alzheimer's or caregivers' support group? Just being with people who have gone through many of the same things you have can make such a difference. When you can share your burden, it's not so much weight on you. Please don't ignore your mental and emotional needs. This is never going to be a happy situation, but it can be better.

It takes her forever to get herself in my van and then I have to drop her off at the door, get her inside with her walker and then go park the car. I am not looking forward it.......Yesterday she spent half the day starring at her wedding pictures album from her second marriage and she still says she does not know her husband and that she did not have 2 husbands. But finally she recognized her 2 brothers. I usually reply to a post that comes in my email. Should I go to the site and click on the most recent instead?

alzheimers_exchange,79_6,"Hi all. Well my slow computer that was trusty backup died before this one. My newer one is still hanging on! My computer is my only joy and hobby it seems and I pray it's not taken away. My link to the outside world!!! MIL is still hanging in. They had her up walking a little today. The therapist told her she didn't think she needed physical therapy at home because her legs were strong. If she would only take advantage of that!!! : ( They wouldn't come long anyway because she will not do anymore than she already is unless she gets worse and when the therapists stop so does the CNA's and help. They asked did she have someone to help her. She told them yes and she had a bell she rang when she needed to get up so someone could watch. She got it right except \she rings it\"". We all know she don't. My neice was there and told the therapist she didn't. Still saying she should be there a few more days. I've actually crashed it seems. You know the \""let down\"" one feels after a dramatic event. Well I feel that way with her gone. When the responsiblity is taken away for awhile (knowing it's coming back) it is so overwhelming and just thinking of the toll it is taking on me and my family. I've just had a mini break down. I think it was actually triggered today when my son told me he didn't want to use the wash clothes because of what MIL does with them. My son can't use the wash clothes in his own house!!?? People don't realize how things like that affects a family especially children. She's wiped herself and left them on their counter in the bathroom and when they picked them up it was awful. After we told her to stop, she did. It was just easy for her to toss them there. When I found them I threw them away but now they don't want to use any at all. Sometimes it's a nightmare & I can't wake up. I find myself dreading having to get back into that groove again that I can't pick myself up to feel free when she is gone. I guess it just becomes such a way of life when you have no one to help and you have it all by yourself most of the time, we don't know how to separate from this. If she would only do a little of what we know she can do. Like I said she will do it for others, but not us. She just sits and wants us to do it all. It's like I'm afraid to feel good and be happy because I know it so short lived. It's an awful feeling! Truly awful. I would never mistreat her in anyway, totally opposite, her needs has to be first --we are all last it seems. I'm preaching to the choir, huh? OH well, Jaye, if it comes to it, you might just have to let your son take out a student loan. It will not have to paid back/payments will not start till I think 6 months after he graduates. So many have to do that and if you can, you can help him make some payments to pay it off faster. Will be much less $ than the 6 months. Im sure the financial aid office will direct you. Don't panic. There is always a way. They will give him a loan and you will have nothing to do with it....it's his. My son got a Pell grant for 2 years of Community college...everything paid. He was having such a hard time in math and had so many remedial courses to take he dropped out. He's not college material at all. He loves the grocery business so he's training for management. Anyway, he owes $400 back and we are finding it hard to pay that. So I know what you mean. Hubby's job is awful. He's working 15-16 hrs. a day and his first paycheck was less than unemployment. Just not a good time around here lately. One of those phases everythings breaking faster than money is coming in. Hard time in the neighborhoods isn't it?. Well take care all. Hope your loved ones allow you all to have a good memorial day weekend. A little peace would be nice . I hope to find a day to do nothing and just enjoy somehow.

alzheimers_exchange,495_0,"How long has it been since you saw a doctor? I don't think it's possible for someone who isn't a physician to diagnose your symptoms. I do know that after menopause, my hair got thinner -- although now quite as much as it sounds like yours has -- and felt that menopausal \brain fog \"" for a long time. I definitely don't remember things and words as well as I used to, and my spelling abilities have also declined. It takes me forever to try to process something that is the least bit complex, and my math skills have definitely deteriorated. I think that, to a point, those are all things that most people experience as they get older, especially post-menopausal women. I remember a year or so ago, doing a crossword puzzle and trying to come up with a 3-letter world for the sound a sheep makes. All I could think of was \""moo\""! It probably took me 30 seconds to come up with \""baa\"". I don't know if you're taking a statin for your cholesterol, but they can cause muscle and joint pain and can also cause brain fog. Since you're taking so many medications, a lot of your symptoms could be attributed to those. Does this sound like your thigh pain? It's the first thing I thought of because I developed it several years ago after a fall, and your description of the pain sounds similar. The pain eventually subsided, for the most part, but I still get it if I'm on my feet too long. You would probably need a doctor to help you figure out why you've fallen so many times, and it sounds like you definitely need to do that soon, before you break something. The difficulty talking after working too long could very well just be fatigue -- I don't think that is very uncommon in people who are overly tired. It might be good to take a list of all your medications to a pharmacist and discuss them with him/her to see if you're over-medicated, or if you're taking things that could account for your symptoms. And please see your doctor. You're obviously afraid that something is seriously wrong with you, but seeing your doctor may actually put your mind at ease.""",2.9,5.3,P

alzheimers_exchange,5_28,"This is for Jaye and Suzee who have been an inspiration in my time of need: People come into your life for a reason, a season or a lifetime. When you know which one it is, you will know what to do for that person.. When someone is in your life for a REASON, it is usually to meet a need you have expressed. They have come to assist you through a difficulty, to provide you with guidance and support, to aid you physically, emotionally or spiritually. They may seem like a Godsend and they are. They are there for the reason you need them to be. Then, without any wrongdoing on your part or at an inconvenient time, this person will say or do something to bring the relationship to an end. Sometimes they die. Sometimes they walk away. Sometimes they act up and force you to take a stand. What we must realize is that our need has been met, our desire fulfilled, their work is done. The prayer you sent up has been answered and now it is time to move on. Some people come into your life for a SEASON, because your turn has come to share, grow or learn. They bring you an experience of peace or make you laugh. They may teach you something you have never done. They usually give you an unbelievable amount of joy. Believe it, it is real. But only for a season. LIFETIME relationships teach you lifetime lessons, things you must build upon in order to Have a solid emotional foundation. Your job is to accept the lesson, love the person and put what you have learned to use in all other relationships and areas of your life. It is said that love is blind but friendship is clairvoyant.

alzheimers_exchange,600_0,"How upsetting to see your mother starting to show signs of Alzheimer's at such a young age. I can imagine that it scares you to death. I'm not a medical expert, but I have read that poor general health may be linked to Alzheimer's (I don't know if it's different for early-onset Alzheimer's). Since your mother is obese, has she been checked for things like sleep apnea and diabetes? Either of those, if untreated, can be quite serious, and I know there's a suspected link between Alzheimer's and diabetes. Depression may also cause some of her symptoms. Can you talk to her doctor and let him/her know that you're concerned about the possibility of Alzheimer's? The doctor could probably pay special attention to her behavior at her next visit, and perhaps arrange for her to see a neurologist. Of course, there are many other possible explanations for her behavior, so she really needs to be thoroughly checked out. Dr. London can undoubtedly give you more information.

alzheimers_exchange,130_0,"I have cared for my Mother-in-law for 2 years in our home. Because of the disease, along with her own personality flaws such as passiveness and letting others take care of her problems, laziness, we ended having to patch up and take care of alot of stuff. At home she was always playing the \victim\"" and acting more childish for us than for others who would visit or stay with her. I quit my job to stay home and care for her, my family gave up our family life because we could not do anything together as a family, someone had to always be here. I feel and so does my husband that even though she has dementia she still did much less for us than she could have and we were the ones sustaining her in everyway. It got too much and I found myself barely able to care for her because the resentment got too much, especially when I would hear the stories of how she suddenly would get worse when she saw us walking up the walkway....when another family member was staying here \""elderly sitting\"". Emotionally and physically, especially for me, and for my family it became too much. The dr. said she was seeing us as her parents therefore playing the child role in every way, right down to the manipulative side, saying yes mam and yes sir...etc... There are only certain things that we can control with dementias. A part of them cannot help what they do but on some level (depending what stage) I think some they can. I know some aspects MIL could help. When we put her in a nursing facility a few weeks ago she became a totally different person. She suddenly began doing activities; we couldn't get her to move. She became more social; she wanted to stay in her room and watch tv all the time and not even go to the bathroom sometimes here. She began expressing her opinions; we couldn't get anything out of her, she acted as if she was not capable of making a decision. She has always wanted to be \""taken care of\"" and that didn't change with the dementia. Yes, you do get angry, not only with them but the disease itself, you do get resentful, you do get mad and you do feel cheated! It is normal. It will get worse but we have to adapt and as it does get worse we have to remind ourselves that a lot is the disease and not all them. I felt the same way. Everyone said we would be blessed for taking care of her....but I always wondered why? When I felt this way? How could I be blessed? But we are human and we feel what we feel. Time away is so important and I think I could have handled things much better if I could have had that. We had no one to help us so I was just as much a \""shut in\"" as she was and it was taking it's toll on my whole family. Hang in there and good luck! Kathy""",4.2,4.0,P

There's one other thing that a poster here wrote about several years ago, and it has always stayed with me.

They often think they're younger than they really are, so the older person looking back at them just seems like a total stranger. If they can see their reflections in a bathroom mirror, they feel as though a stranger is watching them remove their clothes, bathe, etc., and it's very upsetting to them, as it would be to any of us, to be naked and on exhibit to someone they don't know.

Please remember that your mother's doctors and Alzheimer's specialists are the people to see for expert advice. First things first--you cannot allow yourself to be hurt. The fact that she is striking, biting, and punching you means this needs to be handled immediately. I have seen a wife put into the hospital by her husband's Alzheimer's rage, and it is not something that should be allowed to happen to you or anyone else around your mother. If you're not worried about your own safety, what if she were to do it a child or someone else? Secondly, I would collaborate with any brother, sisters, family members and decide how to handle this. It is wonderful that you've been taking care of her, but what about the future? What if you need a break (which you will!)? Divide this up as fairly as possible. If you have no family that can help, find out what respite care options are available in your community. Thirdly, speak to a lawyer. You need to legally have a guardianship over your mother before you can make any health or financial care decisions for her. Considering her violence and unwillingness to go on medication, the sooner you discuss this and find out your legal options, the better. Finally, you are not a failure if you cannot take care of her yourself. If another family member, or a skilled facility would be more optimal for her--and you--then consider it carefully. Have compassion for yourself and make sure to talk with any caseworkers or patient advocates about options that may be available out there in your community.

alzheimers_exchange,508_2,"I'm so sorry about your parents. It's hard enough when you have one Alzheimer's patient to care for, and one parent going through that terrible disease. Talk to your contact at Hospice and tell him/her that two times a week isn't enough -- they'll reassess her needs and should start sending more help for your mother. Hospice will normally do everything possible to make sure the patient is well cared-for and to reduce the burden on the caregiver. Have you asked your brother to do specific things to help you? Sometimes, people are willing to help, but they don't know what needs to be done. Try asking him to do specific tasks, like taking your father to doctor's appointments, or bringing lunch, or staying with your parents while you go out for a while. As far as putting your parents in a facility, please don't completely dismiss that. The stress of caring for your parents can literally make you sick, and even kill you. You need to think of your own health, too. And Alzheimer's patients often do better in a memory-care facility once they get used to being in a new place. They are surrounded by people like them and they thrive on the routine. There's a regular poster here whose father is now in an assisted living facility and is happy as a clam -- happier than he's been for a long time. You may not be at the point where you need to make that decision now, but please keep in mind that nursing and memory-care facilities are a lot different from 20 or 30 years ago, and a lot of them are happy places where the patients can make friends and get excellent care. Memory-care facilities, especially, can be wonderful places for Alzheimer's patients because everything is geared toward keeping them engaged and active as long as possible, and the staff is very familiar with the needs and challenges of patients with dementia.

She was put on Dilantin for seizures. Since then she seems more alert and much better than when she was at home with us. She was more child-like and had no spunk about her. Now she does.

The stress and frustration can still be almost unbearable. Their Alzheimer's patients may be at a more difficult phase of of the disease than your father is, and everyone has other obligations in their lives than just caregiving. Also, we have had a few posters here who are having to take care of parents when they themselves have serious medical problems. It's unfair to compare yourself to others and say that their lives are easier than yours because they only have one person to care for. You don't know what their lives are like. That said, I do feel for you. Would finding an assisted-living or memory-care facility for your father be an option? Are your children able to help out at all, to take some of the burden from you? There actually are a lot of people who take care of parents while still working and raising families -- it's called the Sandwich Generation. If you google it, you'll find a lot of information about trying to cope with everything. Here's one brief article , but there is much more out there.

There are medications that can slow the progression of the disease. Do you have a care giver for you mother as well even though she lives with you? That may be something to consider.

That's a frustrating thing about finding a food that leaves out an ingredient you don't want -- there's almost always too much of something else, to make up for it. I can see how it would be difficult to find low-sodium, gluten-free foods. Companies seem to be paying a bit more attention to the sodium in foods, but there's still a long way to go. If they just reduce sodium in foods by 10-15%, it would make a big difference to people's health, but there would probably be little change in taste. There are always new challenges, aren't there?

alzheimers_exchange,2_10,"Cyber hugs for you! I know what you are going thru right now. Mom use to pull the same thing with me when she was disgruntled about something. I never knew for sure what it was that set her off, but she wouldn't eat and would just want to sleep and be left alone. Generally she was good natured, but there were those days... Mom would poop herself to get even with me. Looking back, I think she would get angry that Hubby (her primary caregiver) wasn't here and I was instead. So to punish me, she wouldn't let me know if she had to poop and would create quite the mess. Then she's try to \help\"" clean it up, which made matters worse. It was frustrating, but she did this consistantly when she was disgruntled about Hubby not being home to care for her. I don't know if she just didn't want me to take care of her or if she preferred him. (I work full-time and Hubby is retired) The outcome to all this was Mom would forget about it. Her memory was shot from AD and she would be just fine when Hubby was back caring for her. I'm thinking your mom will be just as forgetful and I'm surprised that she carried this anger to the next day. One thing I have noticed with AD patients, they hate losing their homes and cars and basically independence. They really hate being treated like children too. It's like walking a tightrope when you take care of your parent. You want to treat them like children cuz that's how they act, but you also have to treat them with respect because they are your parent. It's really TOUGH! At least your mom is still taking her meds, so she's not really ready to give it all up yet. She's being childish. Ignore it, Cindy and act like nothing happened. And feel free to vent all you want.

alzheimers_exchange,35_3,"If she is not on the Aricept I would try again...and like Jaye and I both said, night time is the best time to take it. My mother-n-law is also on Namenda now which is a drug for Alzheimers. If she is not taking her meds correctly that is a sure sign she needs constant care. I say you have your hands full with the driving issue and the meds. Unfortunately the paranoia, accusing and suspicious nature is part of the disease. It is embarrasing and hurtful when they are at the stage that if they are not aware, others can't tell there is much wrong with them and they could believe them. It caused a lot of family problems in my husbands family because his sister was never around to help and beleived everything his mother told her. It was only after Hurricane Katrina, my husbands brother and his wife had to come stay with us. They had to evacuate Louisiana. Her mother had Alzheimers. When she saw how irrational she was acting she told us she thought she had Alzheimers. We thought it was hormonal. My brother-n-law/sis n law insisted on cooking every night. They bought food and did their share. They were staying with my MIL and we were taking care of their dogs. My MIL was running low on money because this was at the height of her taking her money out and bouncing checks. We had already told them how she was behaving. She told them that since my husband was cooking every night they should give him money for food. They could put it in her bank account and she would give it to him! They were buying food and cooking -not him!!! The next week we made an appointment. The Dr. put her on Aricept and the extreme moodiness and a lot of the paranoia went away. LIke I said before, at first she wouldn't take it because she said it made her sick and sleepy taking it during the day... she took herself off and we notice she was getting worse after a couple of months. When we found out we insisted she go back on it and take it at night. She's done well every since. About a year ago the Namenda was added. I can tell The Aricept slowed down the progression of her memory loss. She was going down fast at first...then it leveled out somewhat. She has been getting worse over the past year. We know it is downhill. But yes, I think it's time your family does something not only for your mom's well being but also for the family and innocent people she may encounter on the road. She could just as easily be killed as someone else. It's tough love and she will not like it. You have to ensure her she will not be stranded, she will get a way to go where she needs to go, even if your family has to create a schedule to get her here and there. If she has friends she can call to take her places, that would be great. Sometimes family are the last people they want to ask for help, we've found that out the hard way. Even now, living in our home, she will ask visitors to do things we beg her to do. Sounds like her pride is an issue also. If she can understand-- so she can tell her friends that her family loves her so much they want her safe and all of you, even her, came to the conclusion that her not driving is best. If the smoother tactics don't work, or dr. then it will just have to be done. I think maybe if all the family have a meeting with her and everyone is in agreement this is how it has to be , she may give in. Who knows? But you all have to support each other. If she has a weak link she will use them to no end! Even though my MIL's mind is not that sharp anymore, she still tries to play my husband and his sister against each other, but now it's with her \stories'....\""we are going to put her in a home or she has the choice to go stay with her daughter.\"" We are not ready to put her in a home and it has been \""her\"" choice not to stay with her daughter and will tell you even now she will never go there...they clash and always have!

alzheimers_exchange,756_0,"Hi sweetteyezz, Has your Dad been checked for an infection or dehydration? If his symptoms suddenly worsened, it's often a sign of an additional medical problem. A medication review is recommended by me as well as the timing of the medications. Also, is there a certain time of day or situation which aggravates his behavior? If someone notes when and where the agitation occurs, and who is there when it happens, you may be able to change the situation or timing so that he is less aggressive. Aroma therapy with lemon or lavender scents also is relaxing. Studies show that the most common reason for aggression among those with these illnesses is the inability to communicate what they are experiencing. Soothing music, lower noise can all help.

When she would tell a story about something, my uncle was always saying, \that's not at all what happened\"", or \""she didn't say that\"". She was telling us about a visit to the doctor a couple of weeks ago, and almost every time she told us the doctor said something or other, her daughter said, \""he never said that at all -- he said this.\"" Her daughter contradicted almost every single thing she told us. The story about the night my uncle had his stroke, and his subsequent hospitalization is very involved and bizarre. I was there, so I know what happened. I have personally heard her tell that story 7-8 times -- sometimes to other people, and other times to me, as if I didn't know about it. The first version barely resembled what actually happened, and each version got further and further from the truth, until it bears no resemblance at all to the true story. And, even though my mom and I were at the hospital with her until I took her home at 1:00am the first night, and the next day from morning until their daughter and grandson arrived in the evening, she's now talking as if we were never at the hospital at all. We're afraid that she's telling other people we didn't even bother to go up there. I think her lies are meant to to make everything seem more dramatic, so she can get sympathy or attention. I really don't know if she even realizes that she's lying when she does it. And when I say she lies about everything, I mean absolutely everything, no matter how unimportant. It's very frustrating, but Mom and I try to look past it because we know she is having a tough time. And she obviously has a bit of a mental problem. It does hurt, though, to know how she has portrayed us to other people. That's really lousy about Dee's cousin. It's so sad that there's nobody in her family to step in and help her. I'm sure there are a lot of people in her situation, but I don't know how they end up getting help.

The most important thing is to be realistic about when you do need help -- you probably already know that from caring for your son. It's too easy to think you should or could take care of everything yourself, and become emotionally and physically overwhelmed. I hope you'll continue to post here and let us know how things are going. Carol",4.9,4.3,F
alzheimers_exchange,613_10,"Dear Carol, It means so much to me to have you to talk with. My children are already burdened with their family problems and when I tell them things that make me weary, he seems I'm complaining or looking for sympathy. That is really not the case. My husbands spirits are pretty low in the forenoon. That is why it is so important to get out to lunch and he can talk to his men friends. Otherwise, he will just sit and watch TV. One evening he surprised me and wanted to go out to dinner. Even though I'm driving, he seemed very alert and always pays for the dinner. Only one time he had a problem when he should have given a $20 bill, he gave a $1 bill and it took him a while to figure out what the cashier wanted. I felt like he was taking me out for the evening. That hasn't happened for a long time even though we eat out a lot. My spirits are usually high except in the evening. When he goes to bed I retreat to the computer, email, games, etc. until I can't stand it any more. Then I take my sleeping pill and sit in front of the TV until I can't stay awake. It isn't unusualy for me to be up until 1:30 to 2: am. Then I'm up at 8 or 9 am. If I weren't so busy, I would get depressed, I'm sure. I do have sleep apnea and have a machine, so I think that is why I have to be sooo tired before going to bed. I am depressed when i find that he has wet the bed. He will go several nights without wetting the bed, then he will wet sometimes 1 to 3 nights straight. Tonight I was so tired and had to strip the bed.

She blows in and out, acts like she's the prodical daughter and leaves till her next visit a few months later. My MIL will \""show off\"" for them. Like she is showing them she can do everything we tell them she is not doing. However, if they start to speak with her about why she isn't doing this or that for us, she will shut down on them also. She's a pro at changing the subject when she don't want to answer! She will then start asking us questions. I know what you mean about being a prisoner. I'm the main caretaker so I'm home all the time. My youngest son graduates this year and leaves for the Navy in November. This breaks my heart we can't take a vacation or do anything while he is still home. We can't do anything together, not church, not out to eat...nothing. My youngerst is only 12 and I can't even make it to parent/teacher conferences or school events most of the time because no one is here to stay with my mother n law. One of us always has to be here and it's usually me! I can't help but feel I did my time and cared for my parents and my brother and they were all taken from me by the time I was 39. We chose to live within a mile of my parents and right next door my husbands parents where we have been for 21 years. We did this because my parents needed me, brother/cerebral palsy/ mother had Parkinson's and father died suddenly for a stroke...both my parents were in their early 60's.... and my father-n-law was sick too for years and died about 11 years ago. So we helped with him. My SIL never helped then either. You would think she would have some sympathy seeing what all we have been through and how we have always been tied down, but as long as she can go on with her life and not have any restrictions and do a 'guilty\"" visit once in awhile she's fine. I guess I should count my blessings because she's not the easiest to get along with. But her mother needs her even though she says she don't. She will get her payback someday, that's all I can say. I don't want to sound cold or uncaring. I love my mother in law and she's helped us a lot in the past just as we helped her. The problem is, I'm her daughter in law, she has 2 sisters, a grand-daughter grown nearby, her daughter is 45 min. away. Since my MIL didn't want to live with her then she don't think she has to do anything. She offered, MIL said no, so that's was her extent of helping. She would have been away from her whole family, friends, her doctors, and she and her daughter clash, they are too near alike. So I just feel it's so unfair no one offers and only comes for very short 20-30 min. visits. One sister is right across the road, good health, but does for people for money! We can't afford to hire anyone much less family. Oh well, if we could fix the world starting with our own situations!!?? Just a feel sorry for myself day! Hope things are well your way.

alzheimers_exchange,615_3,"Hi, It must be tough to see such changes occur .I hope your father has undergone a complete physical including blood tests for dehydration, infection and vitamin B-12 deficiency. There also is screening available for the presence of the APOEe4 mutation gene which is present in some cases of Alzheimer's, especially with onset around the age of 60. The good news is that aerobic exercise such as walking reduces the impact of that gene, according to a recent study. I think both your parents would benefit from daily walking early in the day when your father is more himself. Exposure to late afternoon sunshine, minimizing stimulation at the end of the day, planning relaxing activites or things he enjoys before he begins to 'lose it' may help the situation. Depression also mimics Alzheimer's, so it's important to screen for that as well. Is he sleeping well? Meanwhile, keep working on obtaining a diagnosis. All of is should have financial and health directives in place, and I encourage you to have these discussions with your parents early in the day when he is more himself.

A pharmacist could tell you if there are other drugs that might be helpful but with less dangerous side effects. If she is that violent, though, and Zyprexa helps, the benefits might be worth the risks.

alzheimers_exchange,148_0,"HI! Yes, you should very much be concerned. It's time to stop driving and to get help. First of all, dementia patients do get more confused when they change environments. I'm sure this added to it. My MIL lived with us 2 years and she would do ok for the most part in a very familiar environment but if she had to go to the hospital or even dr.'s office sometimes (we took her, we took the keys from her when she started getting in unexplained bump-ups and reports of her pulling out in front of other friends/family and recklous driving) she would regress to more childlike behavior. We even had a cookout in the back yard and she was not accustom to going outside and a 30 min. trip to our backyard made her go from being fine one minute to totally helpless and childlike when she came in. What happens with dementias/Alzheimers is the mind and body stop communicating at times. Short-term memory is really effected. They can sometimes seem to have altered personalities. They can be fine and coherent one day and helpless and/or confused an hour later or the next. A lot of times they know something is wrong with them and they try hard to hide it. By the time it becomes evident to others they could have already been in many dangerous situations with driving, cooking, even caring for themselves. Basic things we take for granted they are having lapses of judgement and ability to do at times. They may seem fine with one person and another might think they are off the wall. They forget who they told what to making it seem they \change their stories\"" or lie. Which can cause problems in families if everyone is not aware of the problem and how the diesease affects the person. Also they can become very depressed, moody, angry. This is where medications like Aricept really help (best taken at night). I would suggest you get her an appt. ASAP. Dementias/Alz can sneak up fast and the symptoms can get out of control. If you are seeing these things happen now, I can assure you there is much more you are not seeing and she could be a danger not only to herself but to others. Also someone needs to get a durable power of attorney for her health/finances while she still is in a reasonable state of mind. The time comes quickly they aren't capable of making sound decisions in regards to their healthcare and finances. Hope this helps. www.alz.org/alzheimers_disease_stages_of_alzheimers.asp Good luck!

alzheimers_exchange,781_0,"Hello Lauramay, I'm so sorry about the situation with your parents. It's so common for a spouse to refuse to get any help with caregiving and, as you said it takes a huge toll. We had a case manager for my uncle, who had Alzheimer's, and she said that what often happens is that the caregiver will end up having a health crisis and then the family is in turmoil, trying to figure out how to care for the Alzheimer's patient, who is completely overwhelmed by the absence of the spouse and the upheaval in his/her life. Your father needs to know that if he doesn't take care of himself and accept some help, there's a good chance he'll reach a point where his own health prevents him from caring for her. My suggestion would be to contact the Alzheimer's Association chapter closest to you and arrange to talk to someone about this, and see if they can refer you to a case manager. Joining one of their support groups could be a tremendous help to you.

I take care of my mother-n-law who has lived with us for 2 years. I will tell you from experience and so will the others on this board, by the time you recognized symptoms,usually things have been bad for much longer. They have the tendency to hide their symptoms even to the point of misleading or lying because they know something is wrong yet don't want to give in and lose their independence. What you are describing \is\"" abuse and neglect.... but if she is doing this because of a medical problem then she has to get help. People with dementias/Alzheimers are not in control of what they are doing. The mind and body do not always connect and they do things out of impulse because they don't rationalize or analyze things well anymore. If all else fails, if you talk to a doctor, they may can tell you a means to get her treated. If not you or someone may have to go to social services! This can't continue or someone may end up severely hurt or worse. My mother-n-law had already had 2 car accidents, was lying to us about bathing, was not taking her medicines correctly if at all, was irrational, causing trouble in the family because she would tell one person one thing and then something else to another.....we found her sitting in her chair watching TV one day while the house was smokey and food was burning on the stove and she was clueless. All this before she was diagnosed. One wrong turn/decision and she could have killed herself or someone else. From what you are seeing, I can almost promise you the actual situation and what you don't see is most likely much, much worse. Your grandfather, I'm sure is not telling everything, and is probably scared to. His health is going to go downhill fast. I think I can safely so the situation is out of control and has to be dealt with now....it can get worse, much worse, and very fast without treatment! Please get her help and get your grandfather help!! Your grandmother can't care for herself and should not be allowed to care for someone else. You or another family member please Talk to a doctor, tell them everything you have describe here and go from there. ....social services can help and if nothing is done and something happens as a result of abuse or neglect they will step in and handle it with or without permission!

alzheimers_exchange,512_0,"That sounds pretty distressing. I don't have any experience with it myself, but I don't think those kinds of delusions are unusual in Alzheimer's patients. I have a friend whose mother, who had Alzheimer's, used to wander off to her neighbors' houses and ask if they'd seen her babies. She was always convinced that she had babies but they were lost. Have you talked to your father's doctor about this? There may be a medication, or adjustment in a medication, that could help. I really don't know a better way of handling it than you are, but I hope his doctor can do something to calm the delusions. Someone else here might have some good ideas, too. Please come back and let us know how he's doing. Carol",3.5,2.9,P
alzheimers_exchange,109_21,"Shawn, I'm soooooo sorry to hear of your grandfather's passing. However, we do know that death can bring a blessing. I lost my mother to complications of Parkinson's, a brother that had Cerebral Palsy, epilepsy...and complications...and my father who died I think from downright depression! All the members of my family...including my only grandmother recently. She was in a nursing home and not the person we knew at all. She barely was existing, skin and bones and didn't know who anyone was and at times if she was even in the world. But she fought till the ripe age of 93.....but it was time. I know you know it was for your grandfather! I wish you the best dealing with your grandmother. I guess that will be your focus now. I pray for your grandfather's soul and for your family!!

I don't know how many children you have or what their situations are, but I wonder why none of them came to be with you during and after your surgery? I can't imagine letting my mother go through that alone. Do they give you any kind of support as you're going through all of this with your husband and your own health? I think that Byroney's suggestion of sending them a link to this thread is a really good one. Do you have friends you talk to? I know that being the spouse of someone with Alzheimer's is a completely isolating experience -- that's why it can be so helpful to join an Alzheimer's or caregivers' support group. You can talk to people who are in your shoes, who know what life is like for you, and who may have learned some ways of coping that could be good for you. I hadn't thought of the grief and surviving spouse groups that Byroney mentioned, but those are really good ideas, too, as is reaching out to your church, if you have one. Since you're afraid of missing a phone call if you go out, what about getting a cell phone and giving the VA center that number? I know how hard it is to make yourself cook for just you. After I was divorced from my previous husband, I had a terrible time with that so I ate a lot of frozen dinners. Those are a lot healthier and better than they were then -- maybe you could load up on some so you don't have to worry about cooking. Even if they aren't the most ideal choice, they're a lot better than nothing. You need to try to take care of yourself. I wish I knew something to say that would make you feel a lot better, but I don't. Please, as Byroney said, reach out to people and let them give you some help and support. You don't have to be alone.",3.8,4.6,C

alzheimers_exchange,283_2,"Since you're so far away, that does make it a lot more difficult. Does her husband understand, though, that if she kills someone when she's driving, she could end up in prison and they could lose almost everything they have if they are sued? By refusing to make her go to the doctor, he is endangering her life and the lives of the people on the road with her. I have read that some anti-depressants can cause sleep disturbances in Alzheimer's patients. If you know what anti-depressant she's taking, maybe you could google it and see what the side effects are, and if there is information about giving it to Alzheimer's patients. This must be very upsetting and frustrating for you. Unfortunately, if her family won't push her to find out what's wrong, I guess there isn't a lot you can do. I hope they will see that by trying not to upset her, they are doing a lot more harm than good.

alzheimers_exchange,655_3,"Hi Tina- I'm glad that things look a little bit better now, and that your mother doesn't need hospice care yet. I wonder if the sleeping might be from being over-medicated? Maybe you could give a list of her medications to your pharmacist and see what he/she says. I suppose, though, it could also be just a total lack of energy because of all of her health problems. Have her vitamin B and D levels been checked? Could she possibly be dehydrated? Unfortunately, I think that sleeping all the time is also one of the symptoms of later-stage Alzheimer's and, other than checking for physical causes, I'm not sure if there's much that can be done. Does your mother recognize your stepfather and know who he is? If she doesn't, there's probably nothing to be gained by his continuing to visit if it causes problems with her. If she does know who he is, that's a tough one, though. You'd hate to tell him not to visit, for both their sakes. Maybe if he could just keep his visits brief, that would help. Regarding the advance directive, I think this is an area where the Alzheimer's Association might be a big help to you. Here is a site that will give you forms for your state. I would definitely recommend getting advice from the Alzheimer's Association, though. This is something they've undoubtedly counseled a lot of people about.

alzheimers_exchange,534_8,"I'm so very sorry that you lost your mom. She was lucky to have a daughter like you, and I know you felt lucky to have her for a mother. I think that having been the main caregiver for someone does make grief a little more complicated because, for so long, every minute of every day revolved around the person you were caring for. I have not been in that position but, after my uncle died, my aunt seemed at a total loss to know how to fill her time. The things that always drove her crazy -- like my uncle constantly calling for her if she was out of his sight -- turned out to be the things she missed most for a while. It's been about three months now and she's still adjusting, but getting better about finding other things to do. The thing that has helped her most was getting a cat -- he is wonderful company and gives her something to take care of again. Grief is so different for everyone, though, and I don't know what might be most helpful for you. There is a Grief Community on WebMD that you might find helpful. There may also be a bereavement support group in your town. One of our regular posters, Marilyn, lost her husband a few months ago and she may be able to share some of the things that have helped her. I know that she has stayed busy and in touch with friends and family. I hope you will continue to post here whenever you need to. Everyone here will be glad to support you as much as we can.

alzheimers_exchange,634_4,"Hi Chris, What a worry! I would suggest you definitely go to a neurologist. It is unusual for Alzheimer's to start at such an early age without having relatives who also got the disease below the age of 60. You also may benefit from neuropsychology testing which would pinpoint the areas in your brain that may be affected by the short-term memory loss. The stress from worrying about what's going on may also be contibuting to your symptoms. Let us know what you find out. We are rooting for you, Judy",3.7,5.2,F

I don't know how far along in the disease's progression your mother is, so that may not apply to her.

After your mom sees a doctor and gets on meds for depression and is still having issues that you have mentioned, I would be contacting her doctor and let him/her know about it. Her doc can do some tests that can help to find any problems which could be dementia, AD, tumors, mini-strokes and a multitude of other things. None of us are doctors on this board, but we can tell you that your mom needs to see a doctor if she's been depressed for a long time. Look up the symptoms of depression and see if those are a fit.

alzheimers_exchange,36_9,"Yes,really! My MIL's sister lives across the street. She cleans peoples houses part-time. If there is something in it for her, she will do something but if not -Forget it. She will come over for a short visit and bring her little things like snacks, etc.-better than nothing! However, she will not even offer to come stay with her for a couple of hours. She knows how stressed I get. She always says how terrible it is that my SIL will not come and help. Yet she will not either. She has taken her friends to dr.s and grocery shopping and errands, they pay her. She went to stay with one of her friends in the hospital for 3 nights because no one stayed there with her..however they also had children that could have--she got paid for staying there (voluntarily) because she missed cleaning 2 houses. I have asked her to do something simple before and I got the \well I gotta do this and that but I will try\"". She sounds like it inconveniences her so much. My MIL is her older sister. She has taken her in years ago when her husband abused her, gave her money when she didn't have food, has been like a mother figure to her. Yet now, she don't have time to sit with her a couple of hours. She has told me many times \""I wish I could do more but I work all the time\"". She is home more than she is away. I can see her car so that don't fly. She don't need $. People do exactly what they want/don't want to. When I ask for help I really need it and when someone acts like they don't want to and they know there is a need --I won't ask again. She is all the time telling everyone how awful it is we have to put up with my MIL's attitude and how grateful she should be and she sings our praises, downs everyone that don't offer to help, yet she acts the same as the others. At least my SIL does live 45 min. away. Families do not help families anymore. So many people are for \""self\"". There will come a day they need help and when they have been so greedy, wonder who will be there? It's very sad. My oldest son was the sports fanatic in our family. I did get to see some of his games before she had to have someone here every minute. My middle son that is leaving for Chicago-basic training in Nov., he didn't do sports the past few years...my daughter is more into band. I do get to see her concerts she has had. There are rare times one of my boys aren't working they can stay while I go, but that is rare. Usually me or my husband take turns. She needs help with things sometimes a male isn't comfortable doing...I'm sure you understand that. It's just the family time I long for. We've never been able to take more than day trips or over night to a Amusment Park, but now that's not possible. It's hard to explain when you know your child is going away and coming back a man. He will be gone for at least 6 mo. Basic and then to Mississippi. That time will be gone and our family as we knew it will be over. I know it will begin a new journey and I know we will adapt and move on, but it is still a loss that shouldn't have to be. If all us caring caregivers lived closer to each other we would be fine!!. Only we know how much we need breaks and what it takes to do this and we could help each other. I appreciate the sentiment. All I can say is if God blesses me and my husband (and kids) to do this on our own without the help of so-called family, then he will provide what we need and more and give us double for our trouble. I beleive he will do that for all of us caregivers who do this because it is right, not because it is convinent and easy. Yes the storm was scarrry. They announced on the news that there was a tornado warning for our street and had the school less than 1/4 mi. from us on the map as a target. We were getting pillows and blankets to cover ourselves while watching out the doors. That's when we saw the swirling coming toward us and above us!! It was definitley an adrenilin rush!!

I had about given up because it's been 3 weeks and I haven't heard anything. I guess now I just wait for final word....ever how long that will take. This leaves us trying to make plans for MIL. It's very hard, but I know needs to be done. Things are getting worse with her initiative to do anything. She's started sleeping with her light on, or did last night, but she wasn't asleep. I went in her room at 1 am...her tv was off. She usually cuts off the light and leaves on the tv awhile. She left the light on and was their wide awake. She's sleeping less. Not getting up, I sure don't have that problem. I've talked to some friends who have had loved ones in a couple of facilities around here....got one great review on one that is both rehab and Alzheimers care. Hubby and I are going to have a look around. That is one she could leave from the hospital and go directly to for rehab and then as a permanent resident. This is really hard, my heart is heavy, but at the same time, I can see some freedom. I'm almost to the point of no emotion if that makes sense. I'm excited to get some sense of life back....yet I feel like I am letting MIL down. Then I keep telling myself I'm over my head and I know my limits....and I'm burned out. If only I could have had some help from her daughter. This is my MIL and I\m agonizing more than her own daughter, sister or other grandchildren and then that tells me all the more this is not right. I feel like we have just made life so easy for them and miserable for me and my family. This came so easy and God gave me what I asked. I asked after the initial super urge I felt to apply in the first place, all the way to the interview I prayed and ask God if this was right to make it soar thru easily--if not to just block it in its track. I was/am at the crossroads of needing exact divine direction because I don't trust my own judgement because I\""m too conflicted. Why are we the ones to feel so much guilt when we are the only ones who have done anything in the first place. I was told by a friend whose mother just died from AD complicatons in the nursing facility that they kept them busy and out of bed. That's what MIL needs...because she will cooperate with others, especially medical personell. So I guess I just need to stop making excuses and admit....this is meant to be. Last I heard when you get called for a drug test you most likely have the job....I'll beleive it when I get the call. Until then, I have to get my house in order, we are having to have a roof put on next week.....and somehow when I do get the final word, prepare MIL. I have to know this is going to be best for her....she can't just sit in a chair and shrink away when she is capable of much more....just not with us. Then, have to tell the rest of the family. Not looking forward to all the opinions that will come out of the wood work. Oh well, I'v tackled AD I guess I can conquer them. Then the biggest challenge....getting MIL adjusted. It will kill my husband if she goes on her \""hunger strike\"" again...and then other family members feel sorry for her and blame us....done gone thru that with rehab...\""that wasn't the place for her\"" Are they going to take her when she couldn't walk? They won't take her for a day when she is 100%-so frustrating and it just makes what should be happy and a time to celebrate (getting a job on the first try in this economy after being out of work 2 years knowing God's hand was in it) this just makes it have a cloud over it.

Ambien also has a lot of possible side effects, including unsteady walking, balance problems, muscle aches or cramps, other pain and hoarseness (you said that she is unable to talk -- I don't know if it's because she's hoarse or something else). Abilify can cause seizures, irregular heartbeat, uncontrolled movements, muscle stiffness and confusion, among other possible side effects. Also, high dosages of Vitamin D were thought for a while to be harmless, but recent studies shown that it can increase the risk of of cancer. Here's an article . Even Melatonin , which is generally considered safe, can cause confusion, seizures, sadness and disorientation. If the dosage is too high, it may also cause difficulty with walking and balance. I am not a health care professional, but it sounds to me like a lot of her problems may very well be drug-related. Everything she's taking can explain some of the problems she's having. She's taking medications that can cause depression and then being prescribed medications for depression that can cause even worse problems. It really seems that she may be over-medicated. I think if I were you, I would have the pacemaker checked first, then talk to a pharmacist about all the medications she's taking, and then go to a different doctor. It sounds like her current doctor(s) is treating symptoms without taking the time to figure out what is really causing them. I know that happens a lot to older people -- sometimes, doctors just figure they're old, it doesn't make any difference, and they just throw more medications with them. I don't know if that attitude might come into play because of your daughter's Down Syndrome. If you know a nurse at a hospital, you can probably get a recommendation for a good neurologist -- they always seem to know who the best doctors are. Best of luck.

I would calmly say, \I am sorry you're feeling out of sorts today. It was nice seeing you, and I'll be back soon.\"" You do realize that if your mother has Alzheimer's, that is not \""her\"" talking. It is part of this terrible disease. Just like if your toddler child shouts, \""I hate you mommy!\"" you need to rise above the words and hold fast to the fact that the person loves you. Depending upon how advanced the disease is, your mother may not have any more idea than a toddler that what she is saying is mean or spiteful. However, if she can get a reaction out of you, just like that toddler again, she may try the behavior over and over (or at least that has been my observation--the other great members here may have other experience to share with you). Finally, you might want to see a counselor or therapist about this. He or she may be able to help you recognize that you need to accept who your mother has become as part of the disease process, and not as a direct insult to you.

alzheimers_exchange,3_8,"Hi Christi and Welcome to this Board! I'm sorry that your DH has been dx'd with dementia. Does his doc feel that this is caused by Alzheimers or is there another reason for the dementia? I know strokes, tumors, brain injuries, etc... can cause dementia issues, especially in someone 67 yrs young! If you are determined to care for your DH, you will have to learn how to be patient. You will learn to do alot of things that you never thought you would have to do. You will also bless your dear daughter for giving you a day of respite every now and then. And basically, Christi, you take one day at a time. You are absolutely correct! You can't care for someone else if you don't care for yourself first. You may have to see your doctor about your husband's dementia and your change in lifestyle. Your doc may prescribe something to help you thru the rough patches. Don't neglect yourself. You should look into care facilities, like Dani suggested, just in case it comes down to that. As he progresses, assuming it's AD, he will need more specialized assistance. Also, being a man, he may be harder to handle because men are usually bigger and stronger than women. So bathing him might be a challenge, or helping him in and out of a vehicle may be difficult. Or it may be that he begins to wander and puts himself in danger or he could put you in danger. Whatever it might be, ther are care facilities for dementia patients. There are good and bad ones out there. I would suggest you visit these facilities to get an idea of what's out there and if you happen to find one that seems particularly nice, you can always put him on a waiting list. Usually the good ones have long waiting lists so by the time he's ready or your ready, the facility will have an opening! All I can really suggest right now is that you get durable Power of Attorney for your husband. Tell him it's to relieve him of some of his pressures. Tell him anything you want. You will eventually need that POA. And my other suggestion, besides educate yourself, is to give him lots of love. You might not understand him, but AD patients do repond to love and caring. And please, if you can help it, don't allow him to drive. It is so dangerous for people with dementia and memory loss to drive. I know it's hard to take the keys away but for the safety of everyone, it has to be done! Good luck Christi. Come back anytime to ask questions or just vent if you wish.

Lyme disease is often over looked by drs, but has serious effects. It requires vigorous treatment and takes a LONG time to recover from. Definitely pursue the Lyme disease possibility. Zyrtec is an antihistamine and would help with sinus issues that are allergic in origin. Since you are concerned about sinus drainage, the sinus rinse should help you.

asthma_exchange,2082_0,"Hi there, Since you are such an asthma newbie, your best bet would be to call your doctor and get his advice on this. It's possible that your asthma is not yet under control, and he can give you advice tailored to your specific situation. If you are experiencing what's called exercise-induced bronchospasm (or EIB), then ask your doctor whether you should \pre-treat\"" before exercise to try and prevent EIB symptoms. Most people pre-treat with 2 puffs of their albuterol inhaler, but others use Singulair or a long-acting bronchodilator such as Foradil. Because you take Symbicort, which already includes a long-acting bronchodilator, you probably wouldn't be able to take another dose of the long-acting bronchodilator. But again, your doctor is your best source of information on this. Also, do you have allergies and did you ride your bike outside? If so, and it's your allergy season, then the exposure to allergens (rather than exercise) may have flared your asthma. I would think this would be pretty common for someone whose asthma may not yet be under control. I will also say, it's great that you're continuing to run and bike despite having asthma-- it's really the best thing you can do for your lungs.

asthma_exchange,2259_25,"No problem...I don't mind talking to myself...unless I answer back, and that would be scary . I first was diagnosed with asthma when I was about 26. It became more severe when I was 28. That year, I was almost taking pred every day, but not exactly as they were experimenting. Since leaving Houston's air pollution and removing every other trigger I can think of, I take 4-5 bursts of pred a year if I don't wear a mask. I have an asthma action plan with rapidly increasing ICS for minor issues that could go bad. Once every two years or so medically I probably should go to the hospital, so I'm not as severe as some folks here. The concern from the PCP and allergist both is the long term effects of pred when started at age 28 at those dosages. My asthma acts like everyone else's when taken as a percentage of my personal best. I use my personal best with my asthma action plan. The issue is that doctors often take it as a percentage of the norm. My personal best on my peak flow meter is 640, but the norm is something like 400 or 450. So, if I'm at 50% of my personal best (320/640) and rescue meds are failing to reverse an attack, some doctors have interpretted this as I'm at 75-80% of the norm (320/400) and therefore am okay. Also, some doctors have refused doing further testing to rule out conditions that can aggravate asthma, stating spirometry readings expressed as a percentage of the norm. Therefore, for 12 years it's still not known if I have something else that is aggravating it, like sleep apnea. To help fix this, I went to the pulmonology office with records of spirometry readings, and explained my understanding to them in writing and orally. Still, they ended up comparing my readings to the norms as opposed to my personal best, persumably due to being very busy and forgetting who I was.

asthma_exchange,1429_3,"Well, I see that you have been quite busy this afternoon. You are doing a good thing reading as much as you can and asking a lot of questions. It can be hard at first, and sometimes later when there are changes, learning to deal with asthma in an appropriate way. The basic breathing technique is demonstrated in the following link: http://www.webmd.com/video/vocal-cord-dysfunction-asthma There are some variations of the technique, but they are all similar. How long has it been since you started treating your asthma? It can take a while to get it under control. So be patient with the meds. Inhaled steroids can take up to 2 weeks before you start to notice a difference. Most asthma meds do cause some degree of jitteriness, but you usually do get used to that and it fades over time. When I tried Symbicort, I got REALLY jittery the first few days for about 30 minutes. It was so bad I couldn't even button a button. That did stop though after about the third day or so. We all get more aware of how we are breathing. See if you can take a few deep, relaxing breaths to normalize your breathing and think about something else. Your lightheadedness could be several things and you should discus that with your doctor at your next visit if it continues. Keep coming back and asking questions. That is the best way to learn. Sonya",2.6,5.1,F

asthma_exchange,1736_0,"Is she on any controller meds? What antihistamine is she taking, if any? I would strongly suspect fall allergies, and that seeing an allergist would be more beneficial (and frequently easier to get in with). Ask for a referral to an allergist and as well and see if you can get her in there more quickly. Also, shortness of breath or chest tightness up to twice a week would be acceptable (minor symptoms), but her symptoms are much more serious. She should have been taken to a hospital when she fainted. Talk to her doctor about her using her rescue inhaler at the maximum dosage (whatever her dosing on the prescription is, the pharmacist can tell you if you have thrown the box away).

asthma_exchange,2316_7,"Controllers are medicines you take every day to prevent symptoms. Rescue medicines you take when you have an attack. In more mild forms of asthma, though, perhaps doctors don't use both. When a person has moderate persistent or severe persistent asthma, normally they get an asthma action plan, which I described mine above. It often takes time to get into a doctor, and having an action plan allows a person to adjust their medicines quickly to avoid an emergency and then the person follows up with the doctor as soon as they can. By quickly adding in medicines at the first sign of trouble, the hope is that more severe exacerbations can be avoided. My own plan is according to old national recommendations, and the recommendations in the US I've heard have changed since then, but I prefer to stay with what I know. I do recall when I had a more mild form for a few years, I only had a controller and rescue med and no action plan as I didn't get into trouble. But that was a long time ago and I just remember when I got worse, the allergist gave me an action plan. So, basically, having an action plan enables me to adjust and readjust medicines without having to go to the doctor first, but then I follow up with them at the first opportunity. In more recent years, they've allowed me to follow up at regular intervals as opposed to every time I'm in trouble since I'm used to the plan and it's second nature now. I was describing how I would adjust medicines in my case if I thought I might be exposed to a trigger. I would first double the controllers, then I would be sure all medicines I would need were on my person so I could follow the action plan quickly and effectively should things go bad.",1.6,4.7,F
asthma_exchange,1432_1,"So sorry you are feeling so badly. I know what it is like. My allergist will prescribe Tussionex as well. It is great stuff. So here is an idea for a back door - If you have any Tylenol -3 (has codiene) or something like Lortab (hydrocodone as is in Tussionex), they will calm a cough too. You are taking extra med because they have pain relievers in them, but you get the prescription cough med. My allergist would want me to cough just to remind me to take my breathing treatments. Just make sure you are taking your rescue med on schedule. I set the alarm on my cel phone for every so many hours around the clock so that I am reminded to take my albuterol. At least you can sleep in between treatments with the cough med. Feel better soon. Sonya",4.6,4.5,F

I'm really keen on Symbicort, even though I did like Asmanex a lot. The only thing I had to get used to was that Symbicort initially tasted AWFUL, really chemically, so bad that initially I used a spacer with it because I would almost gag when I inhaled it. Now it's only the first couple of puffs that have the yuk factor. I wonder, why can't they make it taste like chocolate, or strawberries, or something yummy? Fragrances must be a really tough trigger. They do trigger me, too, as well as my allergies, but not so badly any more since I've been on allergy shots and allergy meds, at least as long as I don't actually wear perfumes or use certain scents around the house. It's really hard to escape fragrances since they are everywhere, not only on people wearing perfumes or scented hand lotions, but restrooms (air fresheners, I mean), inserts in newspapers and magazines, hair salons. . . just all over.

asthma_exchange,2097_2,"I've been in emergencies, but as I'm from an area where the ER is overloaded, normally the asthma specialists have a number you call and they call in medicines to try to prevent you from having to go there, or they tell you to go to urgent care. This is not to discourage anyone from going to the ER, but just mentioning how the medical community in the area I grew up in tried to manage it. So, I myself have not been to the ER. Normally, when my rescue inhaler stops working (the meter dose inhaler), then I use a nebulizer as a backup. It has albuterol combined with ipratropium bromide and the side effects are a lot, with shaking and all that, but it is very good at reversing the attack. I also will take some oral corticosteroids, which normally take effect after three hours. The asthma has never failed to respond to the nebulizer. When I've been to urgent care, the only other thing they offer is an injectable form of corticosteroids. But since I've already taken the oral form before going there, they skip it. Sometimes they'll suspect infection, and give me Levaquin. However, from what my doctor tells me using Levaquin with prednisone has some risks to it. So, in urgent care they add corticosteroids and maybe an antibiotic.",1.2,4.4,F
asthma_exchange,2107_2,"I'm glad you are doing better. I've also tried alternative medicine in combination with traditional medicine. Basically, the approach emphasized lessening exposures to irritants across the board-including alternatives for cleaning (ie, baking soda instead of oven cleaner), using plants that NASA studies indicate absorb indoor air pollutants, and eating a lot of high water content food, like raw organically grown fruits and veggies. It's design was to use daily choices to aid in getting rid of toxins. It's just something I experimented with, as it couldn't hurt. It did help, though it did not cure the asthma. I went 18 months without any prednisone and also lost about 50 pounds. It's hard, though, to keep up the discipline. It also included a lot of physical activity, including things like hiking once a week, which couldn't hurt, and in fact the cardiologist said cardiovascular exercise was recommended to help strengthen the heart so it could better compensate for decreased lung function.

asthma_exchange,2428_0,"Hi and welcome to the community. I have several thoughts for you. First, many of us have found blood allergy tests to give A LOT false negatives. I would suggest that you find someone who would perform scratch testing. It is much more accurate. Second, you may want to have your syrum triptase level tested. There are several mast cell disorders that can cause random,unexplained anaphlaxis. I had several unexplained systemic reactions this spring. The last on caused my throat to itach and feel like it was closing. My allergist ordered the test. to check for Mast Cell Activation Disorder. I have not gotten the results back yet. I did keep benadryl liquid gels very handy. Liquid benadryl would probably be better, but it is not very portable. Also, has an of yoru doctors prescribed an Epi-Pen. It sounds like you should have one and be prepared to use it. When I had my last reaction, I got mine out and laid it on my desk. Two benadryl took care of my reaction, so I didn't need it. About the Xolair, I highly recommend it. I have been on it for several years and not had a problem. I hope that helps you. Please keep us posted.

asthma_exchange,477_0,"Sorry I don't have any knowledge of your sulfite allergy, but I have some thoughts on finding a doctor in you area. Note that we are not to mention drs by name and can't recommened any on the boards here. 1) Check out the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Imunology referral section www.aaaai.org/physref/ 2) If your doctors are any good and worth your time in the first place, they should have a list of specialists to refer you to. If your allergist doesn't know, they should be looking through their colleagues and specialty journals to find you the exact person you should see. There may not be someone local, abut they should find you someone as close as possible that can help you. However, some doctors are too proud to do that though. That is why I love my GP. He doesn't just refer his patients to the same specialists. He considers their special needs and finds the best one for them. That is what he did for me in referring me to my allergist. Along with my allergies, I am extremely sensitive to odors. Going to church together, he witnessed me almost passing out several times because of perfumes/colognes. Granted, my allergies are what had me that sensitive to begin with, but he still found an allergist specializing in odor disorders for me. So, call your GP and your last allergist for a referals, that is their job. BTW - I too require a lot of novacaine (3-4 shots) before dental procedures and have had to have much more anthesetic than expected during surgeries (ob called the anesthesiologist back in twice during child birth to increase my dose, and hand surgeon put me out when they couldn't get enough local in me). Thankfully I haven't woken up during one though. I hope that isn't a sign of bigger problems to come. Good luck, Sonya",3.4,4.9,P
asthma_exchange,1748_3,"I agree with Sonya. When in doubt call the ambulance and deal with the fallout later--better safe than sorry. Using your phone in an emergency situation is not the same a calling a friend during the school day. In an emergency your instincts will tell you what to do so go with your gut instincts first. I do understand at your age the hesitancy of using your inhaler at school but you have to remember asthma attacks can be quite serious and can come on very quickly. The SOONER you use your inhaler the less likely you are to need a trip to the ER. Your inhaler is a lifeline and you have to learn to overlook the uncomfortable feelings you are experiencing (and we have all been there) and remember to take care of yourself as soon as you notice you are having issues. In the mean time, talk to all your teachers and make them aware of your asthma status. Hopefully they will understand and have no issues with you using your inhaler in class, or going to the nurse.(I realize most schools have some policy that cover this issue of medication use ) Perhaps you could work out a plan with them so if you need to use your inhaler you could just step outside the classroom and do so--making you more comfortable yet not having to use it in front of the class. MOST teachers want the best for their students and I hope if you talk to each one, explain your concerns you should be able to work out a protocal that you can all be comfortable with and that will protect YOU in the event of a serious attack. A little preparation BEFORE you have an asthma attack is really the best course of action and should make your more at ease. If your school does not have a RN on staff during the day, find out what protocols are in the office and who would be responsible for making the decision to call for help. (I volunteer in an elementary school and the secretaries tend to some medical issues, and are aware of the kids with medical needs, as the schools here do not have a full time RN on staff) Have your doctor write a prescription to be kept on file with the school nurse/office stating when and how you are to use your inhaler---that gives the school a LEGAL obligation to follow doctors orders, and will make them less likely to overlook a medical need. PS whatever you do, DO NOT drive yourself--far too risky. When in doubt call 911. Safety is your best course of action. Mattie PS While I agree with Sonya that in your friends case with a first seizure, the medics should have been called, schools deal with kids with seizures all the time, and generally speaking as long as the seizure passes quickly and there are no injuries a wait and watch approach is typically how seizures are handled.....scary stuff I know. We have a special needs child in the family and have been educated on what to do/not do. After a seizure, a follow up with the doctor may be necessary (definitely with a 1st time seizure a workup is indicated) but its not typically an ambulance ride unless it persists over a certain time frame ( so many minutes) or their is an injury. Its possible the school was following some sort of established protocols in this matter. Personally I'd have been happier if they did call 911 just for safety sake.

asthma_exchange,2238_5,"In terms of the bronchothermoplasty, all I know is my allergist does not like it, but they don't say why. My pulmonary support group says that it's a good idea to get a thorough diagnostic workup to be sure it's only asthma before getting it done. You are not alone. I had mild asthma for 2 years, then 12 years ago it got to moderate-severe persistent. For that year, it was on and off prednisone, then theophylline, along with other drugs. I had to move to less pollution. I started to wear a mask 3 years ago with good results. The only problem is potential discrimination with work which is hard to prove and people not wanting to get to know me and laughing at me. I was told today, \you are so beautiful, you shouldn't hide your pretty face. It's hard for anyone to get to know you when you wear it. You should just use hand sanitizer.\"" Of course, the hand sanitizer won't work due to ezcema. Also, not wearing a mask for employment interviews won't work because when I start to work I should wear a mask since its with patients. The employer could just find a reason to get rid of me after I start to work. It makes no sense to just skip it for an interview. This was from a church member. Another told me that maybe I should just work at home and gave me information. I told her it's a matter of injustice, in that it is discrimination, but she laughed it off. Point is, a lot of people without asthma don't know what they are talking about. I stopped wearing a mask, and was congratulated. Then I said, \""why? I'm making the decision to just get sick so no one else will have to feel uneasy with me looking like a freak.\"" I've tried to explain to people the long term effects of prednisone when taken over the years. It is scary. The problem in my case is the total amount of prednisone taken annually is too high unless I wear a mask, but it's hard to find work with a mask. I have to choose between my health and being acceptable to others. The church member said, \""well, at least you can take it off. You aren't like someone who has a burn.\"" I said, \""what do you mean? Yes, I can take it off....if I don't mind having trouble breathing for 3 months at a time.

asthma_exchange,2357_7,"Sonya, I went to the PCP today. He wants to let the wound heal on its own, but wanted me to use something that donates moisture to it. The medical assistant had a hard time letting me put on a gown and wanted me to keep my shirt on instead. I didn't agree since the wound is hard to reach on my back, and the PCP nearly choked me with my shirt as he was trying to look at it. He then left the wound uncovered and was going to let my shirt get all in it. At that point, I asked for a gown so the wound would not get infected and not have clothing get into it, and at that point, he agreed. When he looked at it, he said the paper tape was irritating my skin, and I looked at it and had to explain to him the marks were from me scratching as the wound itself was itching, but I didn't scratch the wound by only around it. I know this sounds gross...sorry. Anyway, my point to him was that it wasn't from paper tape because I don't respond to paper tape. I had to explain to him how I respond to bandaids, and he said, \well, you should be cleaning it every day.\"" I looked confused, and said, \""I do clean it every day, but then of course put something over it to cover it. If I use a bandaid adhesive every day for several days in a row, the skin gets irritated and has an atopic reaction.\"" He gave me some duoderm, and I told him applying a small sheet would be difficult since the wound is on my back and I have to look in the mirror and reach in a hard to reach place. He saw I could reach it, but I had to try to explain to him that I've tried to put bandaids on the area, but it's hard to look in the mirror at the same time-it's hard to explain....it's in a place that is hard to reach while at the same time seeing it in the mirror. So, he gave me several options, including small sheets of duoderm. He said he was unwilling to get me a larger sheet of duoderm because they are five dollars a sheet He gave me some large bandaides, and some large non absorbant gauze with some weak adhesive. The weak adhesive may or may not keep the dressing in place. Anyway, the gauze I've been using does stay in place, but the reason he doesn't care for it is that it absorbs instead of donates moisture. In the end, though, he said that it was not infected and as long as it stayed not infected it should heal and I would have a scar. I told him after he removed the sutures it had a squishy feel to it under where the sutures had been. He said he perhaps should have kept the sutures in longer, but was concerned with infection. He then asked me again why I used the prednisone. I told him I used it so I could breath. He said, \""are you sure Singulair doesn't work for you?\"" I said, \""yes, I used it for years, and I don't notice a big difference-maybe a small difference, but it has no effect on the total amount of prednisone I use per year. Besides, I found out that there was a fire close to where I live.\"" He said, \""so, couldn't you have put yourself on Singulair before the fire?\"" I said, \""Singulair does not have a large effect for me, and I can't predict when fires will occur.\"" He said, \""well, this probably happened to the wound due to the prednisone.\"" I said, \""yes, I am aware of that. Pollution is one the strongest triggers for my asthma, so which is more harmful to the wound-me not breathing and having anoxic brain injury as a result or the prednisone?\"" He said nothing more. So, bottom line-the wound is clean, the options he gave me may not work since my skin may react or I may have a hard time getting the dressing on the wound as its in an ackward area that its hard to reach while seeing the area clearly in the mirror, but I do have an option to keep it free of infection even if it doesn't have the ideal amount of moisture. He thinks that as long as I keep it free of infection it should heal well on its own. Just in case, he gave me a script for antibiotics and told me the signs of it being infected.""",1.0,2.6,C
asthma_exchange,1903_0,"Hi, welcome to the community. Sorry you are having a hard time. It can take a while. The oral steroid is probably pred but could be Mederol. With that things should turn about pretty quickly. What is your dosage? What is your other steroid? Is it a combo med (Advair, Symbicort or Dulera) or just an inhaled steroid (ICS)? There are several brands. If it is only a steroid, you may need to use a combo med for a while to get things started in the right direction. Are you taking anything for allergies? Most of us prefer Zyrtec (generic) for our antihistamine. Many of us are also on some sort of nasal sprays (steroid and/or antihistamine) to control post nasal drip. Singulair is a different type of allergy controller that many asthmatics will take in addition to an antihistamine. With asthma you have to treat and control triggers or you won't have control of the asthma. I would recommend that you start doing sinus rinses. They are great for washing the crud out of the sinuses before they can trigger allergic reactions. Also, all pets should be kept out of your bedroom. That should help some. There are a lot of allergy control measures that you can implement if needed to help control your asthma. I don't know where you are, but this is a bad spring for allergies (and consequently asthma) here. There are a lot of people really having a hard time that don't normally have so much trouble. One thing to know about gaining control of asthma is that there can be a trial and error period as you and your doctor work together to find the correct med(s) for you. Many of us here take a few as we control triggers too. Patience and perseverence is needed to get to the right combination for you. Take care and God bless. Sonya",3.5,5.2,P

If you'll remember, while in Houston it read normal. Once I got out of the pollution, the values almost doubled. That allergist that did that spriometry testing was also the head of the Board of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology in TX, and he said when he saw the testing from Houston that I should ignore the norms and do everything according to the percentage of my personal best, and he completely redid the asthma action plan.

First let me tell you a little about myself, I have had cough variant asthma now for 6 years, i am disabled so i don't work because of it, i usually am in the hospital anywhere between 5-10 times a year for a week at a time, so far this year it's been 4 times, i am on pulmicort and atrivatn nebulizer treatments 2-3 times a day , morphine for the cough when it's bad , otherwise guifisean ( i can't spell it lol) cough syrup with codiene, about 2 times a day , cetrizine for the allergies, and a rescue inhaler, i can't take symbicort because i have reactions to it, i am also on prednisone now, usually on and off of it , so really i can be on 50 mg than taper, get off and two weeks later i end up back in the hospital so i go back on the prednisone, lol anyway that is just a quick (i hope) little thing on me, i started my bronchial thermoplasty back in dec , the first procedure went ok, it was a same day surgery, i felt fine they did the lower right lung, I ended up with bronchitist but it only lasted a week, than i ran into insurance problems for the next 4 months and i started to get sick , so i was in the hospital a couple of times. So finally the beginning of april i had the lower left lung done, when i woke up i was coughing, i couldn't stop so they put me in the hospital for 2 days and sent me home on a friday. That following tuesday i was put back in the hospital because i was real tight, my pulmo said he had never heard me so bad, i was also coughing, i was in the hospital for 5 days. But i am doing fine now, for me it has been an experience, i wasn't coughing up blood or mucas, all i had when i woke up was burning in my chest and the coughing real bad. The doc told me that they are finding out a lot of paitients are having problems with the lower lungs after the procedure, not everybody, just some people. So now i go in for the final one, hopefully there won't be any problems. I just wanted to give you some other opinion , would i do it again, yep. Because until i am done you never know, i am definitly not your ordinary paitient, i have read nothing but good things about the procedure, I have been all over the country trying to figure out what is causing my asthma, but nobody can come up with an answer, i have tried all types of meds but it seems that i am now not able to tolerate alot of them , of they just don't work, so hopefully this will, I hope you have a lot of success with the procedure , i don't mean to scare you or get you thinking bad things about it, if you can do it, than go for it.

asthma_exchange,1682_11,"Hello Veritas, you know I have been under the weather as well which why I have been less visible. Quite frankly I just read through your thread here. Everyone seems to have given you good advice. I am open with my doctors. I point blank tell them that I might be making much ado about nothing, but I am not willing to take chances. Now, I do have good insurance with a relatively low co-pay which makes that a lot easier for me than a lot of other people. As the others have stated, we can't afford to wait to start treating our asthma. We must jump on the first hint of a symptom or trigger. I think for now while you are in the learning curve of dealing with asthma and still struggling to really get control of your asthma initially that will mean see a dr ASAP for guidance. In the case of waking up in the middle of the night as you did, that should probably warrent an ER trip, especially since you were ill prepared without a nebulizer to treat yourself. You should talk to your allergist about keeping albuterol neb around and possibly get your own neb if your friend will need hers back. With this last bug that my husband gave me, I have definitely learned to value the neb. I could not use an MDI. My breathing was way to shallow for it to be effective. My allergist adjusted my action plan to switch to pulmacort neb in such cases. I felt like the air was hitting a brick wall as soon as it entered my lungs. Gradually my lungs have opened back up and I can almost take a full deep breath now, but that was consistant use of the neb. I also worked at breathing as deeply as I could without starting coughing while nebbing. I strongly suggest that you get into see your doctor again today. Hoepfully your allergist will see you now, but if not your primary seems well equipped to deal with things. Take care and keep us posted.

asthma_exchange,317_3,I would also like to add that the reactions may have been some what severe.

asthma_exchange,2377_1,"Thanks for your thoughts, Bre. I had asthma more like yours when I lived in Houston. I was on and off prednisone, and my peak flows never did get in a green zone even with 80 mg of prednisone a day and theophylline. My guess is it was the pollution. I had grown up in Houston, so my friends and family were there. I don't recall having as much emotional distress from it all back then, though I do recall being fustrated with the asthma itself. I had a guy say once, \I know you...we went to the same college. I would like to ask you out on a date. What do you like to do?\"" I said, \""I like to breathe\"" since I just wanted to be stable with that. After moving, though, it has been harder to find social support. Being new to a community, and then being different makes it harder. I've had times when people have joked about me wearing a mask, but I don't think it was friendly because the same people left me in a bathroom alone without access to my rescue medicines knowing I was having an attack. I had tried to explain to them beforehand about asthma, but they just joked about it. I figure if it was good natured, then why would they not care if I could reverse an attack? I've had other similar situations at work, and one coworker who was supportive (her dad had asthma and she remembers the adrenaline shots) said she was surprised and that you would think healthcare workers would have more compassion. My work has its bad points and good points. On the good side, I can easily have a flexible schedule, which allows me to have food and shelter though I don't qualify for disability due to spirometry readings. Other jobs don't have that, so I'm not sure if working full time would work or not. Also, I can travel to other places with clean air as long as I can work 3 months straight, which typically I can (sometimes not, but usually yes). So, if the air conditions get really bad here, I can take off. It also allows me to save for the future since I doubt my family will help me financially in the future. On the bad side, infection. I guess that part of what makes me have difficulty right now whereas when I was more severe I didn't have as much difficulty is the social support not being so good and various economic issues. I didn't mean to make you feel that you are a disease as opposed to a person, if I did. Truth is, that is part of what gives me difficulty when I wear a mask-people treat me as if I'm an object, a mask, and no longer a person. They don't want to get to know me. I think it's easier when a person has already been your friend then you get sick as opposed to making new friends once your sick, but I'm not sure. I don't like it when they reduce me to a mask. I have considered in the long term if I get worse to retrain in a related field that I could do from home, like medical transcription or billing. Staying in the present and not worrying about the future makes sense. Sometimes I struggle with losing hope. I have written things out, like a journal. What's hard for me with leaving it there is that then I go to work and get made fun of, or I walk down the street and people call me names from their car, or people call me a freak. Or recently I didn't have the money to drive to a close by store, so I walked. As I waited, I found a chair and sat down and got responses from others that weren't very understanding since I looked tired. How do I leave it there when I have to face difficult social scenarios when I go out of my apartment? I have considered moving, but I breathe better here than in most places. I stopped wearing a mask at work since I couldn't get a job, so the social situation is better there though I now have to take more pred. It's hard due to lack of social support, but I do want to thank you for your thoughts and taking the time to write. It helps to know someone who knows asthma and wants to help.""",2.3,2.0,C

That will do a lot to reduce your exposure to dust mite allergen. If you have the energy, you could also wash all your bedding (even mattress pad) in very hot (>130 degree) water and dry it in a very hot dryer, which will kill the mites and get rid of allergen. Making your bedroom as allergen-free as you can will go a long way in helping you feel better. Again, hang in there! And come back here if you have questions or need support.

asthma_exchange,2316_3,"I agree with Sonya-it's very personal. I went from Houston at close to sea level to about 6500 feet (I'm simplfying this for brevity) to live. I had a hard time at first with getting tired fast-yoga routines I could do at lower elevations I was getting out of breath. In addition, my heart rate went up. It's still up although I've lived at high altitudes for more than 8 years now. But, the asthma itself did not mind, and in fact behaves better here than in Houston at lower elevations due to other factors (less ozone pollution). Everyone is different and responds differently. Knowing how I respond, if it were me I would do as you are-increase the controller meds before going, be sure to have all rescue meds on hand (MDI and nebulizer) and be sure to have prednisone in my purse in case something goes wrong. I would find out where the nearest urgent care center is located where you will be traveling....then I would go and enjoy life. I get out of breath easier and can't do as much at higher altitudes, but the asthma and peak flows stay the same and don't seem to mind in my individual case. Hope your trip is good.",3.1,4.6,C
asthma_exchange,342_0,"Your daughter's symptoms do sound very much like they could be due to exercise induced asthma. Singulair is one of the asthma medications that can be used to prevent EIA, but it doesn't work for everyone. You could talk to the doctor about letting your daughter try taking a couple of puffs from a prescribed albuterol inhaler before dance and gym, to try and prevent the symptoms (and afterwards, to soothe the symptoms if they persist). If the albuterol inhaler helps, then EIA would be likely. If albuterol makes her heart race a little too much, there's a purified version of it called Xopenex that doesn't cause that side effect. Dr. Enright does have a FAQ (above) on exercise induced asthma, so you could read that and maybe even print it out to discuss with your daughter's doctor. As far as your daughter not wanting to go back to the doctor, it could well be that the doctor is skeptical. Unfortunately some doctors tend to disbelieve women or chalk their symptoms up to something psychological. Maybe it's time for your daughter to switch doctors.

asthma_exchange,1375_12,"Hi Debbie, Yea... the fragrance laundry stuff does have a smell. Most chemicals do have a smell and the fragrance added is to mask the natural smells. They still bother me while I am pouring them, but they don't leave the lingering fragrance in my clothes that is really bad. I can hold my breath long enough to start the washer. lol. I have found that regular Tide is the worst for me. A friend wore a freshly, Tide laundered shirt to my house the other day - I took a ton of med. LOL Yes, I changed to fragrance free deodorant too, and then started to have a skin reaction to it, or some thing. That is clearing up and I will buy a different one next time. I have found there are several brands available. The losing of my voice is a residual symptom, I think. I try to sing which makes it more bothersome. I used to think that it was from the Combivent, but now I think that it is part of my reaction that is not being treated effectively. I rarely have any other symptom now. Occasionally if I get a draft carrying strong fragrance, I will get a little short of breath, but that clears quickly. Yes, My shot is for allergies which are minimal (only ten things), but my reaction to several of them is significant. I have a seasonal allergen in every month so there is no break. Plus I am allergic to dogs, but we have one any way. He knows our bedroom is OFF limits. To the nurse's credit, she was trying to be comforting. At least she didn't blow me off or tell me to stay away from people. She did care, but didn't show it well. She said way too much. Have you had your igE levels tested? My GP has asked that I have my allergist check that, although I haven't gone that route yet. There is a really pricey shot for correcting that if it is out of whack. From the way you describe the on-set of your symptoms and your dr's diagnosis, I think, in time you will recover and not have the severity of reactions you are having now. My mom keeps praying that my reactions will lessen with time. However, with my asthma now well controlled and the reactions really haven't changed, I doubt it will. In addition, I do have VCD which complicates my reactions. Also, I learned over Christmas that both of my parents have the same problem only not as severe. My dad leaves the house or goes to a different part of the house when mom cooks bell peppers, which I avoid altogether now. I even avoid the ben in the produce section. They also have moved when certain fragrant clouds have sat near (10 feet away) them in church. The other poster did mention VCD, and that the test can be inconclusive. One indicator is to look at the end of lung function tests. If there is a series of bumps instead of a smooth curve, you may have it. Web MD does have a video demonstrating the most basic of breathing techniques. I don't have the link to it right now. The only way I have found it though is to google it, not the Web MD search. It doesn't hurt to try the breathing technique as you are getting your meds out. It is relaxing too, which is beneficial. Well, bye for now.

asthma_exchange,2259_22,"I wish to thank you again for your support. My personal best peak flow on my meter at home is 640, way above the norm. I've faced many situations in which a doctor has said I'm fine when I'm at 55% or so of my personal best because they use the percentage of the norm expected value. First was the PCP who said I was fine though I could only speak one word at a time the rescue meds were failing, I would pass out for 5 minutes or so at a time, breathing with accessory muscles, and doing the spirometry was hard due to coughing and spasming (later found out I was below 50% of my personal best), then the second allergist saying perhaps it was anxiety because he was comparing to norms-turns out the values at the time were around 60% of my personal best, and now insurance denying coverage, and the pulmonology office making decisions by reading the wrong chart, then looking at mine and saying, \your spirometry is good compared to norms\"" and saying additional tests are not needed. The last one was after I showed them how much my peak flow varies, and also gave them the information, including a history of spirometry readings, in writing. True, spirometry for last several years is 80-90% of personal best, but with a lot of prednisone, which I'm trying to avoid. I keep telling them and try to make them listen, but they keep comparing me to norms instead of using my personal best. My neighbor who also has pulmonary problems, said, \""patient, heal thyself\"", and I had to laugh. Anyway, I just wanted to thank you. I'm not sure if they take courses in statistics, but they should. I took the courses, and learned the precautions that should be taken when using norms (ie, was the test normed on a population similar to the subject/patient tested?, etc.) Anyway, thanks.

asthma_exchange,270_0,"It sounds like you should consult a specialist -- either an allergist or a pulmonologist. A cough in the spring could be due to postnasal drip due to allergies, or could be a symptom of asthma triggered by spring allergies. Both an allergist and a pulmonologist would give you a lung test called spirometry to determine whether you have asthma (asthma isn't diagnosed by chest Xray). An allergist would test you for allergies and if you are found to be allergic, would recommend or prescribe the best allergy medicines for you. Many of us with allergies and asthma have to take several daily medications to get full relief from symptoms, and sometimes you have to try different medications to find the right ones that work the best.

Unfortunately, neither she nor the oldest sister appeared to understand the financial repercussions of moderate to severe persistent asthma.

Now, however, the sisters treated me not having money as if I was being irresponsible, \you are an adult and so act like one and pay for yourself\"", etc. I tried to explain, and described a day I recently had in which there was no way I could work (how do you work when you take the nebulizer and are spitting up clear fluid left and right and shaking like a leaf from the neb, and keep coughing, only the lungs hurt and the fluid won't come up due to the tightness, so you inhale the neb treatment the best you can only you're spasming a great deal?)

You should know that inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) do not have the side effects of oral prednesone for several reasons. First, the dosage is much, much smaller. The second reason is that it is inhaled meaning that the medicine goes directly in the lungs where it is used and very little gets into your system. Yes, you should avoid oral pred as much as possible. It has horrible side effects, but sometimes it is the only thing that will get you out of a flare. However, ICS's don't have those effects.

You should visit www.rxassist.com Many of the drug companies have assistance programs that will help you get your medication, many times it is free. Now, for you \OH, I don't want to take steroids.\"" The dosages in ICS's is about 1/100th the size of a dose of oral steroids. Also, when properly used little if any of the steroid gets into the general system where it can cause the side effects that you may be afraid of. I suggest that you request an HFA version that you can use with a spacer. The spacer will teach you the propper technique - you don't want it squawking at you, but you don't want it to be silent either. There is a fine line of noise level that you want it to produce so that you know you are inhaling at a good rate. Not inhaling at the propper rate causes the medication to either land on your tongue (too slow) or hit the back of the throat (too fast). Either way the medication does not go to the lungs wherre it is needed, but in your digestive system. The spacer will train you to the propper inhalation rate. I hope that helps you some.

asthma_exchange,779_3,"Hi, I am Sonya, I have hyper-reactive airways and asthma. I am very sensitive to any kind of odor - fragrances and food smells. I have been working with my allergist/asthmatologist/odor disorder dr for over a year now, and we have developed a plan that lets me function normally. I would say it works for me, but I have come to accept it is a better way putting it. I take too many medicines! Every time I try to stop taking one of them I get an infection or have a reaction, so I have decided that it is better to stay on all of them for now and live a \normal\"" life - acceptance. I would strongly suggest you find an odor disorder specialist. Someone with experience in treating people who have breathing problems because of fragrances. With out my dr's expertise in that area, I wouldn't be going out of the house very much. I also think you should watch this Web MD video and try the technique it presents. www.webmd.com/video/vocal-cord-dysfunction-asthma You should consider the possibility that in addition to the diagnosis your dr has given you, you may have Vocal Cord Dysfunction (VCD). The reason I say this is that you indicate the rescue meds are not helping you when you have problems with fragrances. I assume you are on albuterol or maybe Combivent, which are broncho-dilaters and should cause the airways to open if it was asthma or emphysema. VCD does not respond to albuterol. VCD is a spasming of the vocal cords that makes it very difficult to inhale, but is non-life threatening. It is treated with speech therapy. I suggest you try the breathing technique the next time you are having and attack, while you are getting your epi or whatever you are going to use out. If you have VCD, this technique can alleviate your symptoms entirely. However, I use the technique as a relaxation tool much of the time. I was starting to have panic attacks when I smelled things and started to feel like my airways were closing off. The breathing technique for VCD helped me to focus my attention on the way I was breathing, not that I was having trouble breathing. It bought me time to decide if I was just having a VCD attack (which I do have ocassionally) or if I was experiencing an asthma attack and needed my inhaler. It is possible to have both at the same time. It kept me from making things worse by panicking, which is normal when someone is having trouble breathing but counter productive. I worked very hard to over come the urge to panic. You also may want to try the over the counter (OTC) med NasalChrom about 5 - 10 minutes before you know you are going to be exposed to some thing. That is a mast cell stabilizer that keeps the mast cells from reacting to allergens or irritants and starting the allergic reaction. It short circuits the allergic reaction at the start. I have to stop cooking sometimes and use it. Another key for me was to calm all the sources of irritation that had me vulnerable to the attacks. Any inflammation/irritation of the airways will react more to a substance perceived as dangerous, be it a true allergen or an irritant. I aggressively treat my allergies and acid reflux issues. Stomach acid can reflux and be asparated into the lungs which irritates the lungs and makes them more reactive. As I have gained better control over my asthma, allergies and reflux, the severity of my reactions has declined and sometimes I don't react any more. I think your prognosis is very good if you find the right dr to join your team and help you learn to effectively treat, control and prevent your reactions. I have many other \""tricks\"" that help me cope with things that I would be glad to share with you if you want. For now, see if these ideas help you at all. The condition is complicated and will take a while to sort through. Be patient and persistent. You are creating a work of art not reconstructing a lab experiment. It will take trial and error.

Using a career service is a good idea, but this has been a financial hardship for me, so I may not be able to afford it. I spoke with a social worker and know the contacts in my state for vocational rehab. The challenge will be to find something that can use someone who can't walk so well and also sometimes can breath and sometimes can't. It may involve applying to social security disability, but I need to learn all of that. I'm also learning how to apply for various welfare type benefits. A friend of mine said she and her husband could have me live with them since I can't do my normal job physically, and since we are in an underserved area, it takes a long time to get into anyone. For example, the guy in the area that would be the best for what they think is happening schedules 3 months out....you have to wait 3 months just for the initial visit. I honestly don't know what happened to the hip. The PT doesn't either, because it's just funky looking. It doesn't present like your normal degenerative osteoarthritis with a labral tear according to her, but the orthopods right now are continuing to look at it. They think it's bursitis with gluteus medius tendinopathy combined with labral tear and osteoarthritis....but the presentation isn't normal for that....they are thinking that based on MRI, but the MRI was hard to read in places. I changed orthopod practices and the new practice wants to inject the joint itself to see if that helps to verify it actually is a tear in the labrum since the MRI wasn't definitive, but only said, \suggestive of horizontal labrum tear\"". I rest it, then try to reintroduce activity like you should, only it flares back up. I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't. By rest, I mean literally laying all day and all night in bed or on the couch, expect for absolute necessities. I did this for 5 weeks, the pain went down, but never completely went away. Then, with the least bit of increasing activity very conservatively, it flares again. So, yes, you are right, it takes a long time to heal....but the PT said it was very odd because normally even a damaged hip would not flare back up with the stuff she was adding (ie, lay on the left side and lift the right leg without weights so the gluteus medius has to stabilize the pelvis a bit). This is hardly any exercise at all. She does not believe it will get better with PT alone, and from my own experience working in inpatient setting (each setting sees different diagnosis, which is why I thought it worth consulting an outpatient PT) I don't think so either. Right now, I'm swimming with a pull buoy as long as the hip doesn't scream at me and doing gentle exercise in the pool or laying down gravity eliminated again as long as it doesn't scream at me. I've been resting it to some degree (meaning doing less than my regular activity and listening to pain and altering activity) for 4 months now. I laid down on the couch basically continuously for 5 weeks. Overall, it's not getting better. They put a shot into the bursa a week ago, so 80% of that pain went away. Later this week, another shot into the joint itself, see if it helps, then talk to a guy who does hip arthroscopic repair next week. PT says it will require more than PT and probably some type of orthopedic surgery. The orthopods are considering doing an arthroscopic repair of a probable labral tear because that doesn't heal on it's own. They said that it's cartilage, and does not respond to rest and ice like muscle and tendon do. The PTs I know concurred, saying the only way for the labrum to heal is for someone to go in and sew it back into place.""",1.6,3.8,F

Natural rubber latex causes asthma through an immune process leading to the production of IgE (the allergic antibody). The repeated deposition of latex allergen-bearing airborne particles onto mucosal surfaces of the lung causes sensitization. After sensitization, when reexposure occurs, the release of inflammatory mediators and production of allergic antibodies results in allergic asthma. Airborne latex depends on the use of powdered rubber gloves. Use of cornstarch-powdered latex gloves is associated with a high risk of occupational disease in glove-wearers. Airborne cornstarch particles carry latex allergens into the air.\"" Reference: Fish JE. Occupational Asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis indced by natural rubber latex exposure. JACI 2002: 110: S75-81. Tomazic VJ, Shampaine EL, Lamanna et al. Cornstarch powder on latex products is an allergen carrier. JACI 1994: 93: 751-758. I believe that because of the prevalence of latex allergy in the medical profession, many hospitals and medical providers' offices have instituted a no-latex corporate policy banning use of all latex products in the facility, including balloons for patients. You may want to do a web search to find some of these policies and pursue the issue further with your hospital administration. It would be important first to start working with an allergist expert in diagnosing and treating latex allergy to substantiate your latex allergy and link it to your workplace, so that your treatment will be covered by workers comp and so that legal protections on workplace safety and disability will kick in to protect your career and your job.

I wish now that I had gone to my allergist, but it is impossible to get in with her on short notice and I don't like her PA's. They would have told me to use Afrin before take off though, and I would be a much happier camper right now. Hind sight is 20-20 they say. My ears still aren't right after coming home. They finally equalized and drained, but when they did it went straight to my chest. I now have rattlely cough, but when I am able to get something up it isn't a bad color. However, we know we have to treat the cough. So here I am at 3:20 AM taking my puffs by the clock. You have my sympathies. The good news is that my peak flows are steady or increasing slowly. I am on messenger and would enjoy chatting with you some time. I haven't been on much lately which is disappointing my mom. I better sign in to see if she has left me a message come to think of it.

asthma_exchange,1612_0,"First of all, it's possible for a person to be allergic to pets but yet have developed a tolerance for their own pets, so perhaps that is why your son is able to tolerate your pets. If you got a second cat and/or a second dog, he might start reacting either with allergy or asthma symptoms, so be very careful about adding to your pet family. You don't say that your son is taking any allergy medications, so you might want to ask the doctor about those. Asthma flares (worsenings) can be triggered by allergies, or they can be triggered by upper respiratory infections like a cold or flu. Most people with asthma will be almost certain to have a flare when they get a cold, if they do not take preventive measures (and sometimes even if they do). You should work with your son's doctor to put together what's called an asthma action plan so you know what to do when his asthma gets worse. Many times that means giving him more frequent asthma medications or in higher doses, which your son's doctor will write down for you to guide you on what to do. It's not uncommon for a 3 year old to get frequent colds, but having allergies would tend to make him more susceptible because of ongoing allergic inflammation in the nasal tissues which makes it easier for viruses to get in and cause infection. But let's face it, kids will tend to get a lot of colds until they are about 7 years old, at which point that becomes less frequent. As a person new to this, you might want to read a couple of things to learn more. There is a great website with an Asthma Guide, found here: http://www.asthma.partners.org/NewFiles/GuideToAsthma.html And one of my favorite books on children with asthma is \What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Children's Allergies and Asthma,\"" by Drs. Chiaramonti and Ehrlich. It's a little out of date now, so when it talks about new medications they have actually been on the market for a while, but it's still interesting to read to get insight into how asthma and allergies can affect children somewhat differently than adults. I found it useful when my son was first diagnosed with allergies and asthma. Hopefully these suggestions are helpful to you. There is also a Pediatric Asthma board here which you might find helpful to network with other parents and share ideas and information. Take care and good luck. Judy""",3.0,6.3,P

If you're using your rescue inhaler a couple of times per day, then you should see your doctor. It's probable that he would adjust your asthma controller medication (or add a controller medication, if you don't already take one) to ensure that your asthma is under better control.

asthma_exchange,1283_10,"Well, if you're not adequately controlling your allergies with medications, that's probably why you're still having shortness of breath. Control of allergies is a key step in controlling asthma, and from what you've said above you have year-round allergies that are hard to escape. Singulair has a very mild anti-allergy effect. You should consider taking an antihistamine such as Zyrtec and/or a prescription nasal steroid such as Nasonex or Flonase. It's something to talk to an allergist about. What have you done to control dust mites? Have you purchased allergy covers for your pillow, mattress, and box spring? Are you washing your bedding weekly in very hot (>130 degree) water? And what else are you doing for allergen avoidance? It will take some time to rid your living areas of dog allergen, so again you might consider a HEPA air cleaner. I would suggest that you start seeing an allergist instead of the pulmo, because an allergist can manage both your allergies and the asthma and will likely provide you with better asthma care and hence better quality of life.

Yes, I still take Symbicort, although I have been able to reduce my dosage from the 160 concentration taken 2 puffs twice a day, to the 80 concentration taken 2 puffs only once a day. It's amazing. You are right on PFT and PF definitions. PFT is sometimes used as a synonym for spirometry. My understanding from reading about asthma is that FEF25-75% indicates small airway disease. When I was first diagnosed with asthma, my FEF25-75% was abnormal. I think those of us with small airway disease don't often wheeze, since our larger airways stay fairly open and don't cause wheezing. I have never seen any information as to normal readings on FEF25-75% -- I suspect that's information that is not distributed to patients, and it's probably found in medical textbooks or other medical professional literature that I didn't dig deep enough to find. Have faith, you will get better!! You just have to find the right meds that are best for you. If Symbicort doesn't do it, there are lots of other meds to mix and match to come up with the right combo. And oh yeah, controlling your allergies will relly help control your asthma.

asthma_exchange,1653_0,"Hi Jessi, welcome to the community. Congratulations on your decision to quit smoking. That is the best health choice you can make for yourself and those around you. Stick with it!! So sorry about your diagnosis and your daughters' illnesses as well. Praying for you and them. No two people have exactly the same symptoms with asthma. We are all different. Several people here have had thrush. Some deal with it on a regular basis. I had it just over a week ago from prednesone and antibiotics. Inhaled steroids (ICS) can cause thrush if it is not throughly rinsed out of the mouth. I rinse, gargle and then brush my teeth. I have been on the highest dosage of ICS for the better part of two years and have only had thrush that one time. I have been on antibiotics and steroids several times since last October, the last round was a really strong antibiotic and heavy pred dose which just caught up with me. I take a probiotic which I do believe helps some. Thrush can be treated with diflucan which worked beautifully for me. My throat was hurting much less just 12 hours after my first dose. Prevention is always the best option though. It is very important that you talk to your dr about the episodes you are describing. Blacking out is a very serious symptom. You should probably call your doctor's office and report these symptoms to his/her nurse so they are documented. Your dr may want to make changes to your treatment plan because of them. Also, it is important that you take your Qvar twice daily as directed. That is your inhaled steroid. It will work to reduce the inflamation in your lungs. It is important to take the albuterol as well. It will open things up so that the Qvar can get deeper into your lungs and work better. You should be taking the albuterol about 5 minutes before the Qvar. I would recommend that your read everything you can about asthma and allergies. Also, you should make notes of things to talk to your doctor about - questions, problems, symptoms, reactions to medicines, attacks and what you think caused them. You might find a note book helpful to track your progress, symptoms, medication use, etc and to write your questions and problems in. This will help you remember to talk to your doctor about all your concerns and focus your visit so that you don't waste time. I use the note feature on my cell phone. Then I am sure to have it with me. You should also take notes during your visits so that you can remember every thing the doctor says. I pray that you and your girls get to feeling better.

asthma_exchange,1933_5,"Actually, the reflux and the asthma are causing each other. The current bout of reflux is because a few days ago, I wasn't feeling well, so I took a hit of Foradil (LABA) and had a bad coughing asthma attack anyway. The LABAs tend to leave the valves in my esophagus completely wide open, and the coughing makes it worse, of course. Which can then dump acid in my lungs, and make the asthma worse. I understand the cycle, but I can't stop it. Right now, I'm taking a medium dose of Flovent (220 mcg twice a day.) I also take Prilosec, Zantac and sometimes pepto-bismol for the stomach, and nasal spray for allergies. The stomach meds kinda help. They make my gastric juices less acidic, they just don't make my LES work. The only thing that actually STOPS the reflux is Reglan, and that tightens up my lungs, too. Of course, I've been watching my diet for many years now. (If anyone on the planet makes a drug that SELECTIVELY targets the smooth muscles of the lungs or the digestive tract, I'll have their baby.) I've had allergy testing. I'm allergic to trees, grass, ragweed, mold and dust mites, which means I have outdoor allergies 7-8 months out of the year, and allergies are definitely my worst asthma trigger. When my allergies aren't acting up, the other triggers don't bother me nearly as much. You know, I've always had allergies, but up until last year, they rarely got bothersome. I've been on shots for some of those since July and the rest since September, but so far this spring has been worse than last year. Recently, I hit a point with the allergy shots where I can't increase the dose, because I keep getting large swellings at the injection site, which is really frustrating. Maybe by next year the allergy shots will be working. I have not tried Singular, although my allergist doesn't think it's likely to do much. If I could just find an antihistamine that works without really messing with my gastritis, I think it would make a huge difference. In less than 5 weeks, I'm supposed to have knee surgery. I'd really like to be under control then, but the pollen counts just keep getting higher, and the allergist doesn't think there's anything more that can be done for now. Maybe a couple weeks beforehand I'll go and ask him for a small Prednisone burst. The trick will be to time it right. The gastroenterologist lost interest in me when he did a scope and determined I didn't have cancer or Barrett's Esophagus, just inflammation and polyps in my stomach. (I'm 30 years old. Cancer didn't even occur to me. Now TREAT WHAT I HAVE.) I'm getting an abdominal ultrasound this week, but he doesn't expect it to find anything. Monday I'm going to go to the family doctor. Maybe if he looks at the whole picture he'll see a way out of the allergies-asthma-reflux-gastritis cycle that everyone else is missing, or at least some coping suggestions, because I realize I'm not doing well mentally, and that isn't helping.

asthma_exchange,957_7,"On your other questions. . . . Xolair is indicated for people older than 12 whose more severe asthma is resistant to other therapies. Check your insurance policy, as there may be restrictions on paying for Xolair. It is fairly expensive. And yes, there have been instances reported of anaphylaxis, and researchers are trying to figure out why that is. Singulair has a mild asthma controller effect, and doesn't work for everyone. Some people have side effects. However, it might be worth a try. Salmeterol (brand name Serevent) is a long acting bronchodilator. Due to FDA black-box warnings, no good physician would prescribe Serevent by itself for a person with asthma. The black-box warnings were to advise physicians and consumers that use of Serevent ALONE (without an inhaled steroid) increased the risk of death in people with asthma. Commonly asthmatics use Serevent as part of the combination medication Advair. You may find more suggestions for alternatives on the aaaai.org website, here: aaaai.org/patients/resources/medication_guide.asp Based on conversations on this and Dr. Enright's asthma board, my impression is that not many people take Accolate, which is in the same category of med as Singulair (leukotriene modifiers).

asthma_exchange,864_2,"Just to chime in -- in addition to everyone else's suggestions -- Singulair is what's called an asthma \controller\"" medication. The ProAir and the Primatene Mist fall into another category, the asthma \""rescue\"" medications (or bronchodilators). You can't adequately control asthma with bronchodilators -- in fact, it can be dangerous to do so and this is one reason why people die from asthma. So Primatene Mist is not an adequate or good substitute for Singulair, for this and other reasons (safety, for another). Talk to your doctor about what kind of prescription asthma controller medication you could try instead of the Singulair. An inhaled corticosteroid could be used instead, probably at a cheaper price. For example, if your doctor prescribed for you an inhaled steroid like Asmanex in the 120-dose inhaler, if you used one inhalation per day, one prescription would last 4 months, for just one copay. And as another poster said, most if not all the drug companies have coupons on their website to help you with the cost of the copay. There are many different kinds of inhaled corticosteroids that you can try, both dry powder inhalers like Asmanex and those that come in a hand-held inhaler. Call your health insurance company and find out which inhaled steroids are on the \""formulary\"" at the cheapest copay, and work with your doctor to see if any of those are right for you. Bottom line, I would strongly encourage you to go cheap on the Claritin (yes, Alavert or generic Wal-Vert are fine substitutes) and spend a little extra on your asthma controller medication -- it will be worth it, since breathing is so important to our quality of life.

asthma_exchange,2057_0,"You might have some mild, intermittent asthma symptoms going on. I'm interested in the fact that when you got an occasional cold you were given an inhaler as a precaution -- there must be something in your medical history that would prompt your physician to order that, because at least in my experience it's not a usual thing. Sometimes viral infections will cause asthma (or make it worse), and it could be that that's what occurred to you 2 years ago when you were very sick. Or you could have some mild allergies, such as allergy to dust mites, which live and breed in mattresses and pillows (that would be a possible explanation for your morning symptoms). Exposure to allergens can cause asthma symptoms. And it is common for allergy symptoms to be worse in the morning. I think it would be a good idea to consult with an allergist, who is best suited to evaluate your breathing problems with such things as a lung function test (spirometry) and taking a detailed history such as you've related above, along with possible allergy testing.

Luckily I found a great allergist who has helped me lead a normal life despite asthma and allergies and who has encouraged me to get back into long-distance bicycling. Take care & good luck.

asthma_exchange,2492_0,"Hi, and welcome to the community. I think you need to take the doctor seriously. He may be just trying to get your attention to a small degree, but you are in serious trouble, especially if you do not start taking care of yourself. Asthma is very serious. I had a friend die less than two years ago from an asthma attack. He was out alone hiking in the mountains of Tennessee. One thing I dealt with when my asthma worsened in 2008 is that I did not realize how bad I felt all the time. I couldn't judge the severity of my disease by how I felt. A doctor listens to your lungs and orders tests which tells them how serious your illness is. I can't tell you how many times my allergist told me my lungs sounded \crappy\"" and I didn't feel \""that bad\"". I was used to it and had learned to cope. One thing you should know is that the the Hollywood portrayal of an asthma attack is a late stage, very serious situation. I hope you are not waiting for one of those to start taking your situation seriously. Another thing is what would happen if you got a respiratory illness? Asthmatics can go down VERY quickly when we get one. We must be very careful. If you have excess inflammation from allergies, an illness could be more than you can handle. If you want a second opinion, I would recommend you see an allergist. An allergist can treat both the asthma and the allergies. I personally think all asthmatics should see allergist. Very few asthmatics do not have some allergies contributing to their disease. An allergist will help you gain control of your allergies, and that may not require getting rid of you animals. In summary I think your situation is more serious than you want to admit, probably a little less dire than the pulmo says, and an allergist would offer more options than the pulmo can offer. I hope that helps. Sonya Jeremiah 29:11 For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end... Ye shall seek me, and find [me]""",3.0,5.4,P
asthma_exchange,1323_6,"James, One more thought occurred to me as I was reading your response to Sonya about the ketchup. You might also want to consider whether acid reflux is causing or contributing to your bouts. Many asthmatics also have acid reflux -- perhaps because bronchodilators (like the albuterol in your Combivent) tend to relax what's called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), which permits stomach acid to flow upward into your throat and mouth, causing all kinds of problems. The stomach acid can get inhaled into the lungs which causes asthma-like symptoms in nonasthmatics, or asthma attacks in those who actually have asthma. Ketchup is a fairly acidy condiment, that's why I thought of reflux. You might want to search the Web for acid reflux/GERD diets and follow one of those for a few weeks to see if you get any improvement. Of course, there are lots of OTC medications you could take to combat reflux -- like Prilosec or Zantac -- but perhaps simple dietary changes would help. Just another thought, hope it helps you out! Take care. Judy",3.5,5.5,C
asthma_exchange,2300_0,"Hi Nicatl I see a pulmoniologist, however I don't have allergy induced asthma. I did see an allergist for allergy testing and everything was negative although I was on high doses of prednisone at the time. It is different in Canada because unfortunately we can't necessarily choose who we see. When my asthma started getting worse I was initially referred to an internalist who has an interest in respiratory problems however he was not helpful. I was then referred to a pulminologist who worked with me for about 8 months, and she was good at ruling out other types of illness she then referred me to a different pulminologist who specializes in asthma and COPD. Which in my opinion should have been the first place to go. She has been treating me for a year and a half and has been excellent. She tested for a few more diseases such as vocal cord disfunction and even did a bronchoscopy (look inside your lungs) to make sure they weren't missing anything I do have a very atypical asthma. I was finally diagnosed with severe cough variant non allergic asthma. So for me an allergist would not be beneficial as I have never had an allergic response, however I found her good at looking at all aspects of different lung diseases and ruling them out. Every time I have an appointment with her which is every 4-6 weeks she does spirometery and a full chest assessment, and we talk about different treatment options. She is very knowledgable however she has an interest in asthma so I think that might help somewhat. It might depend on what you prefer but I know she looked at the allergy side of things but I don't react to most allergens. Let me know what you decide Bre",1.9,4.1,F
asthma_exchange,1520_1,"How long has your ventolin inhaler been opened-- out of the foil pack it comes in..I ask because Ventolin, due to its formulation, is only good for 60 days once you open the foil pak...so it might have been expired (I was told by manufacturer you can't go by the expiration date stamped on the canister, or puff count, but by the 60 day mark). Unless they have had a recent change to their formulation--something you can clarify by calling them directly. In general these new formulated HFA albuterol inhalers are not quite as effective and seem to have some odd characteristics when compared to the old style CFC propellant based inhalers. I have heard a lot of folks say they don't work as quickly or last as long as the older inhalers. I can relate to how scary it is not to have a rescue med that you can count on. NONE Of the HFA formulas work for me so I went with a small portable Omron hand held neb and liquid albuterol for my rescue...so not as handy as an inhaler but at least they work reliably!

asthma_exchange,2259_11,"Sonya, Thank you for your encouragement. You represent Christ well. Thank you also for sharing your story. I have gotten to the point where I'm learning there are things I can control and things I can't, so I just do the best I can with what I've got. I think over the years health care has changed to where a patient has to take an active role. At the same time, sometimes I get tired of a health care system, and those within it, who consistently put money before human welfare. This is not to say that everyone in the healthcare system does this, but some practitioners do. This is why I like my PCP. He really is a good doctor, and I get the sense that he does care. The question I struggle with is at what point does a person accept that there is no answer? That's why I wanted to go to National Jewish. I knew that if they didn't know, probably no one would, and so it could all end. But, for now, I just do things one step at a time, slowly and gradually, because I prefer to go slow right now. As it is, I only have so much energy, and it's easier energy wise. For some unknown reason, I've not as much overall energy as I did before. It's one reason why the pulmonary PA thought I might have a deteriorating condition, as she said that is not normal with asthma. I'm glad you found an answer for your condition.",4.1,3.2,C

asthma_exchange,2265_5,"I'm not sure what you mean when you say your state government cut everyone on medical assistance in that I don't know if they cut one program, but still have some programs. It sounds like they cut everything. In my state, they have a stop gap insurance program, Medicaid, and community health centers with a discount pharmacy, as well as a medical insurance pool. Each program has different qualifications. If your state happens to still have community health centers, you could try going by and seeing if they have a discount pharmacy. Sorry to hear about the situation with MDs. I don't like that health care system is so money based as opposed to caring about people. The state insurance I have is trying to change people from Advair to Dulera since Dulera is less expensive. Therefore, they would not refill the Advair. When the pharmacy contacted the allergist, they sent in forms to the insurance saying that they did not believe Dulera would keep me controlled, and that Advair is needed. All I know is then the insurance let me get Advair. When I spoke to the allergist about it, they said that Advair is for more severe asthma, and Dulera is for more moderate asthma. They also mentioned they did not know until I tried how well Dulera would work, but since I currently take a lot more prednisone bursts every year than is recommended, they know I need the Advair. From what my allergist said, Dulera is less expensive than Advair, but it may not be as effective. Still, you don't know until you try it. Best of luck.",2.0,4.3,P

However, of great concern to pregnant women infected with HCV and to women with chronic hepatitis C who are contemplating pregnancy is the likelihood of transmitting the virus to their babies. If this occurs during pregnancy, it is known as vertical transmission, and if it occurs around the time of birth, it is known as perinatal transmission. However, the risk for either of these types of transmission is very low—occurring only approximately 3 to 5 percent of the time. Transmission to the newborn has been found to occur only in HCV-infected women who had high viral loads (the amount of HCV viral particles per milliliter of blood) of at least 1 million. It has also been noted that women who are doubly infected with HIV and HCV appear to have a higher probability of transmitting HCV to their children than women who are not infected with HIV. Breast-feeding is not considered a means of transmitting HCV. Therefore, it is believed that an HCV-infected mother may safely breast-feed her child. In fact, studies comparing the incidence of HCV in breast-fed versus bottle-fed infants whose mothers were infected with HCV showed a fairly equal incidence of HCV in each group of infants—approximately 4 percent.""",1.0,6.0,P

lupus_exchange,1842_3,Hi SLKB! Welcome! I am sorry to hear about your mom's deteriorating condition. Is she on a nebulizer or any inhalers to help with her breathing? I also wonder if she could be having anxiety attacks due to the fact that she is having such a hard time breathing. My mom had COPD/emphysema and had a very hard time breathing. She was on 24/7 Oxygen as well. She would get very panicked when she felt she could not catch her breath. Her doctor gave her an anti-anxiety medicine and liquid morphine in her nebulizer which seemed to really help her a lot! Is your mom seeing a rheumatologist or a pulmonologist for her lung/breathing issues? I would suggest that she speak to her doctor and tell him that she is still having a very difficult time with her breathing. Lupylisa,2.9,4.3,F

When I've lost too much potassium from the diauretics that I'm prescribed my muscles feel very heavy and weak. I am on Gabapentin, generic Neurontin for my nerve pain resulting from the spinal stenosis. When my dosage of Gabapentin was to high, I felt like each leg weighed 200 lbs. I also have been diagnosed with pain from Fibromyalgia. My rheumy. prrescribed Lyrica. Not only did I experience problems walking, I had trouble standing upright with even the use of a walker. What was even worse, was that I actually had difficulty lifting my eyelids! This scared me to death!. I thought I'd had a stroke! I discovered that Lyrica was the problem only indirectly. We discontinued the Lyrica because my feet and legs became swollen to almost twice their size. Withing a couple of days of discontinuing the Lyrica, I could open my eyelids without using my fingers. I am about to reduce my prednisone back to 5 mg. this week. I expect to have increased pain and an increase in the inflammation which causes my joints to swell.. I've decided that I would rather increase my use of the pain meds and methotrexate, which I started taking the first week in June in order to get off the prednisone.

He said my neck pain from having surgery on C56&c6-7 is because when you have surgery the levels below and above the surgical ones have to work harder and they deteriorate then too. But for me, because of it being c5-6 and c6-7 it cant even do that because at those levels there are shoulder blades and rib cage so they cant move at all. Maybe if the new rheum gets me on a better lupus medicine he can see if my neck and back could be helped with injections or procedures, but until lupus controlled he can only give me pain medicine to help it. boo-hoo, I would like to have my whole body of jonts injected-yesterday! I have already had many. Maybe steroid injections will be possible for your mononeuropathy?? I dont know. Or maybe ablation burning) of the nerve would help??

Are you seeing a primary care doctor or a rheumatologist? What symptoms are you having? How long have you been experiencing symptoms. Did they check your vitamin D levels?

lupus_exchange,1944_2,"\DOES A NEG TEST REALLY MEAN NEGATIVE?\"" NO, it does not. NO ONE test can diagnose or rule out lupus. I think maybe they meant that your ANA was negative. See the discussion (s) to the right of this page, ANA testing, and my post about my daughter's ANA test result. ANA is like one of the first and most common test they do if they suspect an auto-immune illness. It shows that your body is producing antibodies against it's own cells. Normally the body only produces antibodies in response to virus, bacterial, infections. Your ANA may be different at different times, as well as the other tests that they use for lupus (or RA, or MS, etc) I know my ANA was always neg until this past year. But I have had these same problems for 10 years. However, this has been the worst year so far. I agree you should get a referral from your reg doc to a rheumatologist, they are experts in this field and they do base their clinical picture on: physical examination, your history, symptoms and signs, as well as blood test results. But not ONLY on any ONE test or finding. It is a cumulative picture of you as a whole. A tip is to see a rheum doc that is very experienced and up with the most current knowledge as well.

But when I read about this type of migraine, I don't fit the bill. These episodes are EXACTLY the same each time except the symptoms are getting harder to control. Here's what happens: I go to bed perfectly fine. No pain (other than usual pain we have) and go to sleep. Some time in the night - usually after I've been asleep for 3 or 4 hours I will wake with severe neck pain - not head pain. The pain will be so bad that I start vomiting and the nausea is horrible.

Because I have electrolyte problems, my levels ( mostly magnesium and phosphorus) dip really low and will need to be treated. As my docs are unable to tell how low the levels are in their office, I am told to just go to the ER. There, I get I.V. Zofran and morphine. Problem I'm having now is morphine and zofran aren't working. They are having to give multiple doses of each and then add in toridol (sp?) and reglan and some times I am sent home still vomiting if my phos. and mag levels are okay. I do not get auras, lights or dizziness. I am able to talk and walk between vomiting. Bright lights do not bother me. I have no pain except in the neck and no abdominal pain - only vomiting and nausea. They have done MRIs and I have been seen by neuro, neph, and endo. My pcp kept me in the hospital for three days with workups once when my levels dropped dangerously low... Found nothing. When it stops, I am fine and just weak. I never know when it's going to hit.

lupus_exchange,2900_0,"Hi and Welcome! This question has been asked many times on this board. There are just as many answers as there are questions. Recently , I posed this question to Dr. Venuturupalli (our resident expert) Here is that post: Lupylisa44 posted: I read so many posts on this board where people who are initially diagnosed with lupus have a positive ANA then, when re-tested, their ANA is negative and their doctor wants to reverse the lupus diagnosis. Most of these patients are still symptomatic. It has been my experience in the 28 years that I have had lupus, that my ANA has been negative on several occasions, but there has never been any doubt that I do, in fact, have lupus. I know that there are many causes for a positive ANA, but does a negative ANA mean someone doesn't have lupus? Is there cause for these doctors to change their minds, or is it that many doctors just know so little about lupus, that they doubt their original dx? It would be great if you could shed a little light on this for all of us. ******************************************************************* R Swamy Venuturupalli, MD, FACR replied : Excellent question. It has certainly come up several times in this forum. However, this is a controversial topic and I'm not sure I have a satisfactory answer. Let me try to address the issues that you've raised. Anti-nuclear antibodies are found in a variety of autoimmune diseases including RA, psoriasis, myositis, scleroderma etc. In lupus over 90% of patients have a positive ANA. A high titre of ANA over 1:160 is generally seen in lupus patients. Titres of 1:40 and 1:80 have been reported in about 30% and 14% of the general population respectively, i.e. patients without autoimmune disease (false positives). They are usually measured using a technique called immunofluorescence (where a flouorescent dye is tagged to a standardized cell that been incubated with a patients serum). Based on how avidly the antibodies bind to the nucleus of standardized cell, titres are reported. The higher the titre, the greater the amount of anti-nuclear antibodies. This method of testing is the gold standard. There are newer methods of testing ANA's such as ELISA which have demonstrated accuracy comparable wit h the gold standard. Occasionally, an ANA may be negative when tested by ELISA and positive when tested by immunofluorescence or another method. Occasionally, patients with autoimmune disease have negative ANA's. In such situations, if doctors feels strongly that the patient has an autoimmune disease, a careful search for an autoimmune disease is conducted including looking for other antibodies such as anti-Ro etc. Occasionally, the ANA tests turn negative especially with treatment. In short, to answer your question, positive ANA titres are seen in most patients with lupus, occasionally they can turn negative with treatment, and rarely we see lupus patients with negative ANAs. ************************************************************** I hope this helps answer your question.

lupus_exchange,1854_1,"Hi lupichug, welcome. Did ur doc diagnose you with lupus, or just autoimmune/inflammatory disease (not specific)??? Did they have you on plaquenil along with the prednisone? If u are/were on plaquenil, it may be helping your skin. Evidently it helps the skin stuff a lot in most. It helps my skin some, but it is still horrible. My rheummy says it's a good thing I am on plaquenil or my skin would REALLY be bad. I dont know how it could be worse!! When the had you on prednisone, how long were u taking it? Did they taper it down or just stop it? Sudden stopping of pred will cause horrible pain and can even be life threatening. Even tapering the dose too quickly causes horrible pain as you described. You respond to prednisone, that is evidence of inflammatory disease of one kind or another. You should call your doc and let them know how bad you are without it, and maybe they will put you on a low dose everyday. I would reccomend this as it makes for a better road than starting at a dose greater than 10mg. Because you will have to taper down anyway, and that can start to be murder if you do have lupus or any connective tissue disease. If they start you at 10mg it may take a week or two to really help, but thats the way I would go if I could go back and do it over again, instaed of being on 60 for 2 months. You may not have any skin issues and have lupus (sle). Or you may not recognize that you do have skin issues until they become worse. Mine didnt appear to be lupus related until they became more severe. Lupus can cause rashes of all kinds, the face, chest, legs, as well as hives. Itching can be without any rash at all, or with one. It's ridiculous!! My skin problems have just gone crazy in the past year, but I have had most other symptoms for 10 years.

And they had some of those pills and gave me one for until I get them. I had to go into town (at least they have a drive-thru) in my pajama sweats, looking crazy. This took up half my day. Of course, whenever I could have a decent day SOMETHING HAPPENS!!!!! This is really hard. I thank God I have a Dr. for a dad, and I am feeling better now. But still........everyday it is one thing after another. And I had complained to rheummy about this and he said try zyrtec everyday......no I did not do that.....it wont work.

lupus_exchange,1319_3,"Hi Lupylisa! Yes, zanaflex works well for me because it is designed to help muscle spasm associated with spinal issues and nerves. Lisa, I am very sorry to hear of your experience with pain meds. That is awful. I cannot imagine functioning on 80mg oxy twice a day and lortab on top of it! I am very well educated on pain meds and pharmaceuticals in general, I used to be an analytical lab tech at Lilly, Schering-Plough, Roche, and Dow. And before and after that I have worked in hospital and my dad's medical practice. But, aside from all that, there is a HUGE difference between addiction and physical dependence. Physical dependence occurs as the body gets used to a substance and builds tolerance. A doctor can safely wein one off a physical dependence. Addiction is not the same, it does include physical dependence, but also has charasteric BEHAVIOURS that differentiate it from physical dependence. Addiction involves the \feeling\"" that one needs the drug. Also, addiciton is where the person abuses the drug. Not taking exactly as directed, or taking more or less at different times. Addiction is a mental and emotional thing. One wants more and more of the drug to get the same original pain relief or feeling, But that will never happen because the first time will always be elusive due to the tolerance. I am not explaining this right, but pain management has nothing to do with addiction (or it shouldn't) Tomorrow I will post a link explaining addiction vs phys dependence. No patient should ever suffer i fear of addiction. I follow my Rx exactly to a Tee, and have never even developed a phys dependence. I have been on Opana (60 times more powerful than morphine and 6 times more powerful than oxy) ER 20, with Opana 10mg for breakthru, Dilauded, Percoet, Darvocet, Vicodon, codiene, toradol, tylox..............over the past 10-12 yrs.

My face was stretched into a foamy face thing and I was making all sorts of moans and groans. But my back was flat. I asked her how she did it, and she said she just stretched the tendons out. That's partly what I spend hours in physical therapy for. I am thinking I might be able to get a phys. therapy order from doctor for back massage. It felt great afterwards. my next favorite activity was the foot massage. She worked out nerve endings that help all sorts of gland problems. She could feel that is where I needed some work. That too, was awesome. The other women, WOW, it was really great to meet such a diverse group, but we all have Lupus and I felt very much at ease with them. Not nervous like I usually get around lots of people. We had women that had mild Lupus to very severe. All were so genuine and sweet, really good hearted ladies. They say the more hardship you endure, the more compassionate you are. Actually, it says so in the Bible in Corinthians 2. So I don't think it was a fluke, that they all were so kind.

hiv_and_aids_exchange,83_2,"1.) While HIV is present in the blood, calling it a \blood-borne\"" disease makes it sound more virulent than it really is. it is generally classed as a sexually transmitted disease because the type of contact needed for infection -- direct contact between infected fluids and a person's blood stream -- usually occurs in real life only during sexual intercourse. That kind of intimate contact is achieved also in the deliberate or accidental sharing of IV needles, but that is much less common. 2.) What I meant by obvious would be if, for example, you accidentally stuck yourself with a needle that had drawn the blood of an HIV+ patient, or if in some traumatic episode you were splashed in the eye by copious amounts of blood from an HIV+ patient. Hospitals and clinics have SOPs in place to handle risks like this so they occur very rarely. The point is, though, that the kind of medical exposure that would you at risk for HIV is very hard to miss. 3.) We generally don't like to go into symptoms because the human mind is very powerful and can create symptoms where none exist if the person is worried enough. However, I can say that many (but not all) people who get infected with HIV experience a short illness 2 to 6 weeks after infection that looks and feels just like the flu. Not everyone who gets infected experiences this, nor does everyone who does experience this experence it to the same degree: many never notice it, a few many need to be hospitalized, and most everyone else is somewhere in between. Like the flu, the primary symptoms are fever, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, armpits, and groin, headache, fatigue, muscle ache, etc. Like the flu, it lasts about a week or two and then goes away and a person experience no other symptoms thereafter. Your three-week long sore throat, then, does not fit the bill. The bottom line is that if you don't have unprotected sex with partners of unknown status, if you don't share IV needles, and if you follow your workplace's safety regulations and don't accidentally stick yourself with a needle or the like, then you really have no reason whatsoever to worry about HIV.

The risk from a torn condom is if the item in question is so blown (pardon the pun) that the head of the penis is no longer protected from the sexual fluids/menstrual blood (if present) of an HIV infected partner. The virus must be able to enter the body, typically through muscousal membranes irritated/damaged through the physical exertion of intercourse or cells more sensitive to absorption of the virus. In other words, getting sexual fluids on your penile shaft would not transmit the virus to you. Sucking a breast and fingering someone are not risk factors for HIV transmission (unless you happen to be an infant with an under developed immune system and you're nursing on moms breasts quite a bit).

Gonorrhea and chlamydia (they often are found together) are much, much easier to transmit than HIV. Ejaculation isn't even necessary to contract oral gonorrhea from performing oral sex. But that doesn't impact your lack of risk for HIV. Likewise, kissing or making out is not a risk for HIV. Regular testing for HIV (every six months) is a good idea for anyone who is sexually active, but it doesn't sound to me like you have been at risk at all. I cannot tell you what is causing these symptoms in your mouth, but I can say that they have nothing to do with HIV.

The Neuro Should run appropriate tests to determine if they were seizures. I have heard there is a Blood test, but, not many Drs know about it, yet. But, an EEG & MRI are needed to diagnose you. We are not DRS. But, we do have Experience w/ Seizures & the proper tests needed. One thing I will say: Seems no 2 PPL have the same experiences during seizure episodes. A Lot of Similarities, but, different actions. Also, Seizures do not discriminate as to When or Where they Occur. You could go mths/yrs w/out another 'episode'. The fact that the last one lasted more than 5 minutes is of Great concern. Seizure activity Usually only lasts 2-3 minutes.

epilepsy_exchange,65_1,"Good Morning ecook, Welcome to Epland. I have a few 'thoughts'. First my condolences to you & your family. I know your brother 'lives' on w/in your hearts & memories. Yes, lots of new advances. Lots of info. 'Homework' is never-ending when it comes to Epilepsy & seizures. Your brothers 'cause' of seizures may not be so 'rare' now. In fact, sounds very plausible. But, there ARE soooo many different causes of Epilepsy. The only way to determine if there WAS more to your brother's 'diagnosis' would be to exhume him. Back in '86, Genetic/Hereditary Epilepsy was unknown ( by DRs anyway). I KNEW! Clik on my user ID to learn my story. A DR told me, that even w/ family history of seizures, mine weren't 'genetic'. My Sis has various diagnoses, none 'genetic'. But, MY daughter's ARE! She & My Sis, were also, diagnosed w/ 'catamenial seizures\ Sooo, I do have a lot of doubts /questions myself. Has your DR ordered any other tests for you??? A 'normal' CT & MRI is GOOD. But, that doesn't rule out seizure activities. Just rules out possible brain abnormalities that could be a cause. Here are 2 sites, that I hope are useful for you & your Daughter. www.nomoreseizures.com/ www.ilae.org/ Browse the ilae site. Lots of info & news. More questions??? need support??

That is a symptom where everything that is very familir is no longer familair any more and you lose all sence of direction, things, and do not know where you are. You know nothing about what is going on. IT can happen over and over again. you need to see a neuro NOW. He/she can run an EEG and get the readins and decide if you have EP and need meds and then he/she will treat you. You will have to ride the med merry-round with the AEDs until he/she finds one that will works or a combo that will work. That is if you are dxd. I rode that ride several times and have had ep for 10 years now thathas been documented. I now have a combo that finally works. I had 2 EEGs that finally came back clean. I ahve NEVER had an EEG that camae back clean all abnoraml. I take 600 mgs of Vimpat, 600 mgs of Lamictal, and 3 mgs of Klonopin. The Vimpat and Lamictal are 200 mgs above the normal adult dose, but it works for me. I also have a device called a VNS or Vagus Nerve Stimulator.

epilepsy_exchange,2302_1,"Witnesses did not see any unusual behavior? It may be possible they walked in after the seizure (physical) activity was over & you were still post-ictal. Old rule of thumb: 2 seizures=Epilepsy. BUT, Stress seizures are Usually Classified as Non-epileptic episodes. PNES Psuedo-non-epilepsy seizures/syndrome. Meaning that no abnormal electrical events Caused the seizure. It does Not mean your seizures weren't Real! PNES just needs to be Treated differently. Our anti-seizure meds won't Work on PNES. You need to seek a Counselor/psych. To learn More about PNES visit epilepsytalk.com (link in Tips or Resources) or use your Search Engine & search for NationalSeizureDisordersFoundation.org. You can also use our Community search Tool to see what others' have said &/or experienced w/ PNES. There is a breathing technique for panic/anxiety attacks.

Please read & then Print up the Info provided. For His Teachers! Best Advice for Parents w/ children who have Epilepsy: Continue to treat your child Normal. Hide your fears the best you can! A child can sense Fear & it can cause them to Stress. Which is a #1 Trigger for Seizure Activity in some. Next: Learn Proper Seizure First Aide & teach those who have daily contact w/ your Son! Next: Start a Daily Journal. Info as to what to include is in our Helpful Hints. You will need to Limit TV until you get an anti-glare screen &/or Prescription Polarized Sunglasses. Tell His DR about this. It is Another Seizure Type: Photosensitive Epilepsy. Your son shouldn't Need special Ed. He will need 'extra time' to do classwork or homework due to the Absence Seizures. He has no clue what is being said or done when he has an Episode. The Epilepsy Classroom will give you more Info. I suggest you discuss All this Info w/ Teachers & School Nurse & School Counselor. Once you start Learning, things will get easier! I Swear! But, it is Important to Educate your Son, Also. Please visit epilepsytalk.com or efa.org sites for Lists of Books/Authors that are for All Ages. Note Titles/Authors & ask your Local Research Librarian about the Availability of these books. If they can't find them in your library they will search other counties/States or Locate a Bookstore w/ Used versions. The Prognosis: Some kids Outgrow seizure activity, especially the Absence form,. But, others' will remain on meds their Entire Life. It will take Time & Patience to find a med that Works for your Child. There are Alternative Treatments, too. Such as Diet. The Ketogenic Diet was being used B4 meds were Ever developed for us. It has recently been Proven to be Very effective, in most cases. You don't have to Join the Sites I mentioned to read their Info.

You can learn More about that med w/ WebMDs Drug Tab, up Top. Do not let Side effects Scare you. Side effects are what we watch for, not what will be! Everyone's Body Chemistry is different! Just know that IF he develops a Rash to report to his Neuro or Pharmacist Immediately! Give his med 2-6 weeks. It will take that long to build up to a 'therapeutic' (helpful) Level that should cease his Seizure Activity. But, if Side Effects occur w/in this time frame, that are Intolerable, again: consult his DR.

Access to the page should be at the bottom of this page. It is, also, not unusual to go mths between seizures. Hallucinations, I believe, are, also, Simple Complex. One lady noted Bert & Ernie b4 seizures. Multiple episodes such as you described are known as 'cluster seizures'. Plus, Headaches/migraines have been proven to be co-morbid w/ seizure disorders in some people, too. But, do not lead to seizure activity, in most cases. People w/ seizure disorders are just more susceptible to having them. Please, note All activity that you can remember. Read about Journals in Helpful Tips./See All. Questions for your DR? Check out our Resources. 3rd page, I think. Clik on my pic or ID & read my Journey w/ Epilepsy. Hugs! Love Candi",2.9,6.1,P

epilepsy_exchange,1762_2,"Hello everyone, My name is Angie. I moved to Las Vegas in March '07. Before then I lived in Mpls for about 14 yrs. I was raised in the Bay Area, north of Berkeley. I was diagosed with ep, shortly before I turned 14, in late March of \75. I have been on at least 10 different anti-seizure meds. A couple of them had been research drugs. I had a partial rt lobectomy done in '02 while I was in Mpls. The outcome was great. I have experieced an 80-90% drop of siezure activity and my meds have been greatly reduced. Before the lobec, I was experiencing 10-20 seizures/mo. Now I have about 1 or 2 in a 16 wk period. Great!!! I have always been very open about my ep. I feel I have nothing to hide or be ashamed of. We all have something to deal with. It is a matter of whether who/what is the stronger. You or your condition. I'm a fighter. My seizures might have put my on a different or slower path than I wanted but I have always done my best to keep moving forward. I love football, baseball, jazz, classic R&B(you know, The Temptations, Earth, Wind, and Fire, Maze, etc), and working with kids. I started my life with kids as a volunteer at my old elementary school when I lived in the Bay Area. I later worked with the Mpls Public Schools for about 10 yrs. Any questions?

epilepsy_exchange,719_2,"Hi Emily, The Ketogenic diet is geared for children. But, there are adults who have tried other diets such as Modified Atkins Diet. My Sister was placed on a High Fat, Low Carb Diet by a 'Homeopathic MD' for her Diabetes/Epilepsy. She had less seizures (so she says) But, szs did stop, when he added progesterone cream to her regimen a few yrs ago. He discovered her szs were caused by 'hormone changes' AKA Catamenial seizures. To the rite under Resources is 'See All Resources' clik on that Then use the 'alternatives' to learn more about the diets. I think the hardest part is getting a DR to agree to try it. :( But, yes, it is a limited diet & at her age, best done by ALL family members. YEP! YUCK! But, the site I'm sending has 'recipes'. :) Another support group w/ members who have 'been there, done that': http://www.coping-with-epilepsy.org/ Mom, don't get ahead of yourself at this point. It is a good possibility her szs will be 'outgrown' or like mine, go into remission for 25 yrs. :) Oh, what the levels imply? They keep track of the amount she has in her system. Sometimes, the Liver doesn't process the med correctly. She could/mite have too much or too little in her. As you will learn ALL treatments are 'trial & error'. And what works for one may not work for another. PPl, also, MAY experience the same side effects, milder side effects or have none at all. Well, Mom, guess what? If you decide to go w/ the 'diet' you will just have to 'make/take' time to read them labels. :) But, after a few weeks you will know what to buy & what not. Have a GREAT day.

I have had Gran Mals & have noted occasional Absence. Probably more than what I suspect or know about. They can happen & B4 ya blink an eye be gone. All my EEG's have been Normal.

I guess I shouldn't be upset about certain types of seizures not showing up since I don't have the memory or comprehension problems every day or even every week. At least the most common types I experience have been detected.

epilepsy_exchange,2241_0,"Hello Kim, I apologize for not answering sooner. Welcome to WebMD Epilepsy Community AKA Epland. Yes, I have olfactory auras, too. Thankfully, they don't lead to Bad seizures. Most likely because my meds control the Bad seizures. Some days they last for a few seconds, other days they last for a few minutes, but reoccur over & over & other times they just don't/won't go away. Mine are more frequent as the yrs go by, too. Or at least I think so. I had seizures (3 convulsions) as a babe/toddler, over 60 yrs ago. I May have had Unseen or silent seizures but, the convulsions went into remission for 25 yrs & resurfaced after a head blow. I knew nothing about Seizures or Auras for over ten yrs after they resurfaced, so, never kept track of the symptoms. I didn't even Know I had 'silent' seizures (seizures w/ no apparent activity) until I had a Portable EEG done about 5 yrs ago. Suggestion: Under Tips please read the Journal Info. When you see your Epi, definitely Inform him/her of your auras/odd smells. The frequency & Length. So how long have you had seizures? Have you had other Types of seizure activity? Are you on any medication to control them? If you have any more questions, please ask. Knowledge is Power! I Promise to try to chek the boards More Often! Love Candi",3.1,4.3,F

But, I was assured by my OB/GYN that it was 'safe', although my Neuro did Lower my dose for the PG. But, my 'gut' told me there Would Still be problems w/ my child & this med. But, it controlled my seizures & somehow (I was totally Ignorant about EP & meds at that time) I knew that was Better for my child. Lots of EP women have had children while on EP meds w/ no complications. But, Dilantin & Pheno's have proven to be 'unacceptable' for PG. But, they have been around a Long Time! As for Keppra. Who Knows. It is, in my opinion, too new, thus not enough evidence to say one way or another. The best you can hope for is seizure control.

I've had a rough couple of days & maybe should post this on a different discussion. I usually don't complain about my husband. He's always been supportive. But a couple of nights ago he was talking about my spells where I have trouble expressing myself & end up dragging out long sentences. Normally I don't have this problem. I think it is a type of seizure. I can't see clearly, I can't say what I want to say, my words are slurred, I can't comprehend what others say to me, etc. Seizure, right? Well, my husband was saying I need to resolve within myself not to speak that way so that when I have a seizure, I will be able to stop myself. I told him a person cannot stop a seizure at will. I actually cried myself to sleep 2 nights ago when he first said it. It still bothers me that he thinks that way. I thought he was finally understanding this. Maybe I'm wrong to expect that when I don't fully undertand it. What do I do? I don't want to be so self-conscious that I stop speaking. I guess it's just another thing to discuss with the epi.

epilepsy_exchange,1353_2,"Hello Walker, Possible Stress over Christmas & missing meds will do that. :( Did you ask your DR about taking meds all at once? I did. Why? Cuz, they were making me sleep almost ALL day & nite when taken as prescribed, 3X a Day. That was over 20 yrs ago. The DR agreed I could take full dose at nite. I have been s-f except, like you, when i have forgotten to take my meds. Which has been rare. :) I believe the thought is to maintain a consistent level at all times. And as long as taking them all at once isn't tooo much for you, you are fine. So, if your new regimen (3X a day) doesn't work (you show signs of mood swings, over-tired or any other side effects) then call your DR back & ask to go back to old regimen.

Parkinson's disease can cause constipation and difficulty with voiding. In this setting of severe constipation, stream initiation (relaxing the urinary sphincter) may relax all pelvic sphincter muscles and cause defecation. This would be more likely to happen, when the urge to urination is high - in the setting of prolonging the duration between bladder emptying. Here is a suggestion. Have him increase his fluid intake - to assist with his constipation, and put him on an every 2 hour bladder emptying schedule during the day.

parkinsons_disease_exchange,656_0,"Hi, worn1 This work lead by the Dawsons at John's Hopkins, is quite exciting, and was recently published in Nature Neuroscience. Accompanying the publication, was a press release that likely was the source for the article in Bio-medicine. Below is a direct quote from the paper. This report is quite exciting, but they appropriately point out that this approach was highly successful in preventing cell death in an animal model. The scientific community has yet to identify the mechanism of action in LRRK2 associated PD, but the fact that a specific type of drug, called kinase inhibitors, can do this is truly hopeful. \The major finding of this paper is the identification of kinase inhibitors that inhibit LRRK2 kinase activity and protect against LRRK2 toxicity both in vitro and in vivo. Other kinase inhibitors have recently been reported to inhibit LRRK2 kinase activity with similar potencies to those described here12 , 13 , 14 , 15 . Given that an authentic substrate of LRRK2 has yet to be identified, there should be a note of caution regarding the physiological relevance of the screens used in this and related studies based on autophosphorylation and artificial substrates. These results hold particular promise for further studies focused on developing selective and potent inhibitors of LRRK2 kinase activity. Moreover, they demonstrate that pharmacologic inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity is a potentially promising therapeutic modality for the treatment of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease.The major finding of this paper is the identification of kinase inhibitors that inhibit LRRK2 kinase activity and protect against LRRK2 toxicity both in vitro and in vivo.

parkinsons_disease_exchange,638_0,"Anon_59151, Levodopa is often a very reasonable approach to treating early PD. Given her busy schedule, I think the levodopa for mobility and the biperiden for tremor is appropriate; although if she is not having slowness of movement or balance problems, medications, such as pramipexole, rasagiline and ropinirole are also reasonable. Delay of levodopa is an effort to delay the development of dyskinesias, a condition that can be monitored and treated easily. Despite fears, there are no data confirming that levodopa hastens the progression of PD, and I do not think this is a useful discussion at this juncture. The ELLDOPA trial (Fahn et al, New England Journal of Medicine - 2004 [I think>) reported that it took nine weeks for benefit to be seen from 300 mg levodopa per day. There was no dose for 400 mg.

parkinsons_disease_exchange,602_0,"Hi, tman95. What you are experiencing is \wearing-off\"" - defined as a re-emergence of your PD symptoms as your medication levels drop. Symptoms of wearing off that you describe include, increased anxiety, return of tremor, and when your medicines are really low - drenching sweats. Sinemet lasts from 2.5-4 hours with each dosage. Sinemet CR lasts 3.5-5 hours. The CR has a broader peak than the regular Sinemet - so in essence, the medicine wears off more slowly. If your meal times are around 7, noon and 6 you have peak dose times at about 9 am, 2 pm and 7:30 pm. This is when you should feel your best, and the times you are most likely to have dyskinesias - or involuntary movements. The trough times (or wearing off periods) begin with increased anxiety followed by tremor likely around 11 am, 3:30 pm, and 9 pm. The drenching sweats in the night are likely 6-7 hours after your supper dose of regular Sinemet. Strategies to discuss with your doctor: 1) Take sinemet more often - portioning the 3 sinemet and 2.5 sinemet CR every into four hour intervals for 4-5 doses rather than in 3 doses. (I would not be concerned about a total levodopa dose of 1000 mg/d) 2) Adding an agent to make the sinemet last longer (rasagiline or entacapone) 3) Adding an agent to compliment the effects of sinemet (pramipexole or ropinirole). There are now once a day versions of these pills - more expensive, but more likely to take you off the roller coaster of on and off that you are now experiencing. These agents will also last through the night - and may stop the drenching sweats. The dry mouth is likely from dehydration, a side effect of diamox (and the night sweats), so you should drink more (8-12 oz of water at breakfast and lunch). Some antibiotics will change the effectiveness of Sinemet, but I would not make any changes for the brief time you are taking them for dental cleaning. One more thing: \""Sinemet\"" is the brand name for carbidopa/levodopa. A \""25/100\"" tablet contains 100 mg of levodopa, while a 50/200 will contain 200 mg of levodopa.""",1.0,6.1,F

parkinsons_disease_exchange,718_1,Dr Stacy Thank you for taking the time to respond to my questions. I lost my depth perception long before I was diagnosed with parkinsons. But like any other handicap you adjust and adapt. I wish I could stay on nights but I have been fighting a loosing battle. The neurologist and my husband have both been pressuring me to switch to days. In fact I was told that no one with parkinsons should be doing shift work and if I did not switch to days my license could be pulled. Note I have no problems driving. No speeding tickets or any other violations. I have explained to both I am not a day person and there is less stress on nights than any other shift. But what do I know I am just the patient. Althogh my husband should know as I did work days for a year and I was the biggist witch. Co workers would cry if they found out I was working with them and my husband asked me to go back to nights. My boss and coworkers remember. As far as cognitive testing goes I will be making a stop at the liasons office after the 1st to see what can be done. You know Dr Stacy I do not understand why most people in health care make it so diffucult for patients. I work in health care and I pass along the problems I have to my fellow health care providers hoping they will remember that they could be in the patients place one of these days. I have seen health care providers rushing past and almost knocking patients over or see a patient struggling to walk to their appointments and have health care providers walk on by as if they were not there.

parkinsons_disease_exchange,767_0,"Hi, sparky1109 Thank you for your note. Comtan, or entacapone, is a drug that increases the delivery of levodopa to the brain. While it does not cross into the brain, perhaps, by increasing the amount of levodopa delivery to the brain, it can cause some psychoactive effects. It would be important to talk with your doctor about these symptoms. If they are vivid dreaming, or only occur in sleep, this may not be related to your medications at all. This may be a condition called \REM Behavior Disorder\"" and may be treated with a bedtime dose of clonazepam. If you are having these symptoms at particular dosing intervals, such as just after your afternoon medication, it may be reasonable to ask your neurologist if that dose should be adjusted. Finally, you may not wish to reduce your PD medication at all, because it may reduce your mobility. In this case the addition of a medicine for hallucinations may be a better choice. It is likely that your symptoms can be helped; please talk with your neurologist about your options.""",1.6,5.8,F

It may be found by going to PubMed, and searching: \DOMINION.\"" )You may also type in \""Stacy, M\"" - if you would like additional information. In the DOMINION trial, we interviewed almost 3,000 patients with PD, and found compulsive spending, gambling, sexual behavior, and eating to be in 13.6 of the PD population. While we were not able to make any assumptions about risk factors, these behaviors are associated with advancing PD, and increasing dosages of levodopa or dopamine agonists (pramipexole or ropinirole). Treatment is intially reducing PD medications - usually the dopamine agonist. I would advise you to call your Neurologist today, and ask for some direction on how to reduce the appropriate medication.""",1.0,5.3,P

parkinsons_disease_exchange,531_5,"hello again, T -- i'm not sure i could say is \typically\"" the first sign of parkinson's disease. i can tell you what the first signs were for me. because of these, i already suspected that i had PD before i ever went to the dr, altho of course it was a major disappointment when the dr confirmed my self-diagnosis. i hadn't wanted to acknowledge to myself how much i had hoped i was wrong. i had tremors in my hand. i could no longer do fine motor movements -- tying knots, putting on earrings with those little holders in the back. and my handwriting got really tiny. somewhere earlier i had read about the tiny handwriting being a sign of PD, and that was really the very first thing i noticed. i have always been a clumsy-bumsy, so if i had had any trouble navigating, i just attributed it to my natural lack of coordination. the final thing that confirmed my diagnosis for me was that once i started taking meds for it, all of my symptoms got better, and some even disappeared. at first i was terrified. since then, i go thru periods of still being terrified and then hardly thinking about it at all. i have made some adjustments to my house that help now and some others that i anticipate will help in the future. after falling down the stairs for indiscernible reasons (fortunately the stairs and the landing are carpeted), i put a second bannister on the wall going up the stairs (parallel to the first bannister only on the other side of the stair steps). i moved all my computer stuff downstairs so i hardly ever have to go up and down the stairs any more. after falling off my back porch for indiscernible reasons, i put up nice-looking iron railings along the sides of the porch. after falling or fainting inside several times for indiscernible reasons, i put some really strong hand grips about two feet off the floor so i could pull myself up from the floor. i also put really strong hand grips on each side of all doors to the outside (on left and right side of the door, not inside and outside the door); these help tremendously for getting in and out of the house even when i'm not feeling unsteady. i put up bars in the bathtub. finally, i got a fancy-looking cane -- i figured all of those ugly utilitarian kinds would make me feel depressed -- which i don't use all of the time but which i do use on days when i am feeling unsteady (i call them \""wobbly days\""). i am wobbly for about two or three days/month, i would guess, but that is the only symptom that has really persisted since i began taking my med (requip XL). webMD is a good place to come for any kind of support. i've loved it since the first time i stumbled upon it, which must have been several years ago. take care of yourself, T! -- susie margaret""",3.2,4.4,C

parkinsons_disease_exchange,662_0,"hello, 66844 -- i am so sorry that your brother's condition has deteriorated so badly. i know that you will have your hands full, and i admire you tremendously for taking on those responsibilities. i think i can answer some of your Qs but not all. HEALTH INSURANCE let me say, first thing, that you need to keep in mind that i am no expert on insurance policies for health care or anything else. therefore, with respect to anything i suggest about health insurance, you must check it out with someone much more knowledgeable than i before you take any action based on what i say. i want to stress this, because some decisions about health insurance can be very difficult to change or even irrevocable, and i would be devastated if you ended up making some serious miscalculation and detrimental decision on acct of my summary of what current law is or future law will be. i've never quite understood what kaiser permanente is, and i apologize for the consequent likely stupidness of my Qs. nonetheless, is it a group plan for employees of some particular employer, or retirees of the same employer? a large-scale private plan, such as blue cross, that anyone can sign up for, no matter where they work or their employment status? etc., etc. if it is a private plan of some type, i think you need to be very careful to get new insurance for your brother before you cancel the kaiser plan. this is because i am 100% certain that parkinson's disease is considered a pre-existing condition that would currently lead any insurance company to deny your brother as a policyholder. my belief is that under the new health care law, it won't be long until insurance companies can no longer use pre-existing conditions as a disqualifier for accepting a policyholder, but that provision doesn't go into effect until 2014. between now and 2014, a person who cannot get health insurance because of a pre-existing condition can sign up for an interim plan that covers people with a pre-existing condition, but there are certain provisions in this interim plan that make it less than ideal for someone in your brother's circumstances. the most onerous one is that the applicant has to have been uninsured for six months before s/he can be accepted into the interim plan. given your brother's situation, he does not want to go uninsured for six months. if he is already a policyholder in a plan that cannot use his parkinson's as the basis for canceling his coverage (meaning, kaiser), my advice is that he stick with kaiser until at least 2014; then he can compare the kaiser premiums/provisions with the premiums/provisions of the plans that will be available in 2014. of course, if you do find another health insurance plan that will accept your brother as a policyholder now despite his parkinson's, the logical thing to do is to compare premiums/provisions. frankly, however, i don't think it is likely that you will find such an insurance company at this time. oops -- i see that i am about to run over the word limit for this post, so if you would indulge me, let's go to my subsequent post to continue. -- susie margaret what good is gold, or silver too, if your heart's not good and true -- hank williams, sr.",3.9,5.2,P

parkinsons_disease_exchange,624_2,"hello again, chris -- this is the second part of my post about the difficulties of figuring out how to handle your father's care now that he is deteriorating more quickly from his parkinson's. i think you are being very loving, and very wise, to think about this. i see the problem as bigger than how to help your mother day to day, and that is the Q of how everyone characterizes the responsibility for your father's care. my view is that these kinds of situations amt to a family problem and need to be solved collectively, with the help of everyone in the family. in other words, i think that your role and the role of others in your immediate family -- i'm not sure who you mean when you say \we\"" in your post, i'm hoping you mean that you have siblings -- is not to help out your mother whenever it fits into your schedules and doesn't interfere with other obligations that you have. no, what really needs to happen is for you and the others in your immediate family -- -- to reconceptualize what your obligations are, -- to include your father's care as one of them, -- to evaluate the tasks/time/energy involved in that care, and -- to divide up the responsibilities for that care. the sooner everyone is able to make this philosophical shift, the easier things will be from here on out. the best reason for determining the actual tasks/time/energy needed to care for your father in the immediate future, however, is not because it will facilitate decisions about who can/should contribute time/money (altho it will); it is because it will also guide the decision-making about the primary concern you express in your post -- when your father has become so disabled that it is no longer possible for the family to care for him at home. once everyone has a grasp of the amount of time/energy that is required for him to stay at home, it will be obvious much more quickly, i believe, when the demands of his care have crossed the line from difficult but manageable to heartbreakingly unmanageable. and before that point -- i.e., now -- is when you start investigating what your options are for when that point comes. in order to think about when your father might no longer be able to stay at home, tho, you need to know what is happening while he is staying at home. perhaps you could start by having a family meeting, with everyone present who is in your immediate family; for those who can't be there, another person must have permission to speak for or make commitments for the absent one. do you have siblings, or do your father and mother have siblings in good health? all of those people have to be included. then your mother -- who will know the most -- and everyone else should come up with a list of all of the things that need to be done for your father, every day and periodically, and how long each one of them takes.

(of course, i still had to cope with the broken bones for the next three months, which was a real drag!) at any rate, definitely follow redbear's advice, but if my experience sounds anything like what you have been going thru, then you might want to bring up with your dr the possibility of needing to change the dosage of one or more of your meds. -- good luck to you, and, as always, in deference to redbear -- susie margaret",4.0,3.6,F

If you have no other PD symptom (change in voice volume, a masked facial expression, rigidity or bradykinesia in the tremoring limb, small handwriting, difficulty dressing or showering) and your doctor does not believe you have responded to sinemet, then this may be a consideration. I have talked about the diagnosis and prognosis of PD in several responses today, and would ask that you look at some of these.

parkinsons_disease_exchange,756_0,"Dear Anon_150288 Thank you for your note. I must admit I am puzzled by this also. Your mother is no doubt disappointed by the loss of hope from not having a surgery, and I think you should try to help her with some answers about the OR and any future interventions. I would first ask her if she remembers any of the surgery, and at any point did she sense something was going wrong. She may have become anxious during the event, and I know of a case in which a patient insisted that the surgery be stopped, and tried to sit up to leave. He did not remember the event, but we really did not wish to try surgery again, out of concern for his potential health risk. Then you have to approach her doctors with some finesse. I am sure everyone health care person involved is embarrassed at the outcome and worried that your family will be angry. I suggest you call the Neurology office, and talk with the nurse or the doctor's assistant, and report your concerns. Using your best manners... express you worry about your mother, and would like to help her to understand why the surgery was stopped. Tell the assistant that you would like an appt to talk with the neurologist about several things, and that you hope that he or she will talk with the surgeon before you meet. Did she get upset in the operating room or during the MRI? Was the equipment working properly? Did the surgeon use electrode recordings to assist with target location, and if so, were they unusual or abnormal? Then questions just for the neurologist. Should we pursue surgery with someone else? (Especially if no intra-operative recording was done.) Do you think that she does not have PD, since the surgeon could not find the path? I think that is a reasonable way to start. You will want to discover all the information you can, and it will be more successful, if you and you mother are able to minimize your frustration. There may be some silver lining in all of this. I suspect everyone will be more responsive to your concerns in the future.",3.1,5.2,P

Succeeding in college with untreated ADHD is slim to none. I would not fund that endeavor. My husband is 49 years old with ADHD and working in law enforcement. My first son (ADD) was valedictorian at high school and is pursuing a career in criminal justice. He is 20 years old. He no longer requires medication. His symptoms were mild to moderate when he was younger. The second (ADHD) is moving successfully into middle school (age 13) with good grades and good social skills. He is currently on medication and will likely need it for quite some time if not throughout his life. Medications are/were not the only treatments used for my sons.

You said, ""The chance to succeed at college with ADHD and the denial or refusal of treatment is slim to none. "" That's not really true. Treatment does NOT equal drugs. There are other treatment options available that don't require medication. Having ADHD doesn't make you an automatic failure. You fail your kid when you say that. Don't close your mind to the real possibilities. It may be hard for you to understand what's coming. I think your kid is very young. When your kid is small and they may seem like a bouncing ball of destruction and noise until you put them on pills. It's not like that for adults generally. We run late a lot. We forget appointments. We forget to bring stuff. We don't always hear what people are saying. We kind of zone out when we're bored. We get frustrated easily and we say stuff that sounds mean when we didn't mean it that way. Drugs can help. But they're not the only way. There is a lot of info out there now. Life skills is a necessary part of any treatment plan even when drugs are helpful. Some people don't need pills at all once they know how to address their symptoms.

Thanks for being patient and explaining. I appreciate that you responded and did it politely. It looks like we're in near total agreement on ADHD treatment after all. I just wish you'd be more positive about her chances at school. You may be right, but telling someone that can make it a self fulfilling prophecy. ADHD people get lots of negativity. I try to make things brighter most of the time. It may not seem that way, but most of my posts are pretty up beat. People here need that I think. Yeah. I know objectivity is important, but it's also boring. You're right about education outside of the classroom. Sometimes dropping out doesn't mean giving up. I technically dropped out of HS, but really I just changed schools. I took adult education classes for computer programming during the 2 years I was waiting to qualify to take the GED by turning 18. I almost maxed out the test and got an award for it. I had enough credits to qualify as HS and some college in the Army. I only need to take 3 classes to get my Computer Science degree and I've never set foot on a college campus except to take a placement test. Traditional college may be too hard if she takes on too much. She might be able to CLEP out of some classes or do some other form of self study. I'm pretty good at taking tests because I can study at my own pace and completely concentrate on one thing. So that may be an option for her too. I got my MCSE in 6 months thanks to hyper-focus without drugs. That was in 1999. Long before I knew anything about ADHD. Please accept my sincere apologies about getting you mixed up with someone else. I got your kids age wrong and the part about drugs = treatment. I'm pretty sure I was thinking of someone else.

add_and_adhd_exchange,1367_4,"I was hesitant to post a reply here because I asked a similar question a while back. I wanted to get people thinking about what's good in their lives. I wasn't sure if I'd have anything interesting to contribute. Maybe I do. For me ADHD is the wrong acronym for my condition. I don't have an Attention Deficit. I have Attention Overload. The only ""Disorder"" in my life is the way I organize (or not) the stuff in my home and in my head. ADHD has taken me places most people wouldn't want to go and wouldn't appreciate anyway. ADHD people make lots of mistakes. The actions we take to correct those mistakes are just as likely to lead to more mistakes as they are solutions. In school, I was disciplined a lot. I met some very interesting people that weren't in my normal classes. As an adult, I may find myself in the wrong building or arriving on the wrong day only to run into someone I haven't seen in years or discover the incredible statue in the fountain in the lobby of some company I'd never even heard of before. Sometimes I might take the wrong exit in the middle of the night and find myself sitting at the bar in a Waffle House in the middle of nowhere at 3:00am deep into conversation with an 87 year old man about life and the nature of the universe while I'm waiting for the tire place to open. Once I met a homeless man at the gas station where I worked and gave him my clean laundry basket and all just so he'd have some decent clothes to wear. He turned out to have some kind of mental problem because he would occasionally march around and salute the gas pumps. He NEVER asked for anything and when I did give him money, he'd buy food. I smiled at him and talked with him every day while I watched my favorite jeans deteriorate into rags. I can say my life wouldn't be the same if I hadn't met him. He was crazy in a nice way and knew some amazing stuff. His view of the world made me think differently. If I was a ""Normal"" person who thought things through, I might have snubbed him or been too busy with a ""real job"" to even notice him. That seems like an empty life to me. I can't say how many interesting conversations I have had during my years standing in line to pay the electric bill before they shut it off. I once dialed a wrong number 3 times in a row. The lady who answered thought I was hilarious and we wound up going on a few dates. Have you ever gotten lost in a conversation and found yourself staring at something on the ground that turned out to be a $20.00 bill that 100 people missed? I have. Ever think it would be a good idea to jump over the stopped train instead of waiting for it to move then find yourself trying to figure out how to jump from a moving train without breaking anything vital before it gets too fast? I have. Ever find yourself in the St. Johns river paddling a piece of Styrofoam shaped like a boat motor that you got from the dumpster at a marina after the cheap inflatable pool raft you started out on deflated? I have. The best part of ADHD to me is the part of me that never really grows up. I'm a 38 year old boy. I watch cartoons because they're more interesting than the news. I draw comics and read them and still like to put Batman stickers on my stuff. I have a good job and a nice house and all of that. I'm a responsible citizen and a good father. I just happen to like the same stuff my 6 year old likes. So we spend lots of time together and I love every minute of it. She's a lot like me. She's smart, funny and has her own unique style and sense of humor. She talks a mile a minute and so do I and we keep each other entertained. My life hasn't all been easy, but it hasn't been boring and I have a million stories that nobody would ever believe could happen in real life. Well, you can have real life. I'll stay in my ADHD world. I can't wait to see what happens next. Good luck. - Chris",2.3,2.1,C

(I can't say that the way I usually do here, but you get the idea.) Once I was warned about a certain Doctor who could ""destroy you."" I said ""No. He can't 'destroy' me.

I know you're worried and you're under stress because of the tension between you and your son, but try to let that go and see what he does in a different light. He's obviously got personality. ADHD people have a different sense of humor sometimes. I know I do. When he's more mature, he'll be able to make you laugh because he'll understand what ""normal"" people think is funny. This is just is just a personal theory because of something I noticed in my own extended family. I recently spent time with my brother and sisters (plural) kids. Most of them have ADHD just like the rest of us (parents aunts, uncles). We were yelled at as kids a lot. We have a tendency to yell first and think later. It's an ADHD thing. Just like your son. The good thing is we have a thick skin about it. It's not easy to push any of us around. Sometimes that's a good thing as an adult. The thing is I spend a lot of time with my own kid who most likely has ADHD. I watch the same shows she watches.... voluntarily. I admit it. I still watch cartoons as an adult. There I said it. I'm basically a grown up kid in a lot of ways. Everybody says I'm funny. They also say that about my daughter. Anyway, I noticed that most of the time my dad or my sisters got mad at the kids for being mouthy or rude when the kid was just being funny. I asked niece to do something and she responded with a line from a cartoon. I answered her the same way they do in the show and we both had a great laugh, but my dad was ready to get all worked up until I explained the joke. To him she was being a smart mouth, but she thought she was being funny. I got the joke and we both had a great laugh. It's the same thing adults do only most adults get the reference if it's from Seinfeld or Eddie Murphy whatever sitcom is funny these days. Like how Steve Martin used to say ""Excuuuse meee"" or Billy Crystal ""You look Mavalous!"" Same thing only kids and cartoons are pretty obnoxious these days. The reason I'm saying this is you said he ""hisses at his enemies."" I bet that's hilarious to watch. Can you imagine a bully or school jerk talking trash, then you hiss at him like a cat. That would crack me up. The day the stock market crashed back in uh... 1986 I think, I almost got beat up by a school bully who didn't like something I'd said. This was 8th grade. Anyway, he started off by talking trash. About 15 minutes later, he was literally crying because I'm really good at talking trash back and most of the kids who had gathered to watch me get turned into hamburger were laughing and pointing at Cecil not me for a change. Fast forward a lot of years... I'm at work. I'm a tech. One of my fellow techs is this guy who knows everything. Really he does. He's very intelligent and knowledgeable, but he's also obnoxious about it. At this point in our life, my wife also had an evil cat that hated my guts. The cat would hiss at me all the time. I hissed back as a joke. Later when my wife would bother me, I'd hiss at her as a joke. I did that for so long it was instinct. One day at work, Bill was being himself and I'd had enough of it. He started on me about something stupid. I turned around and hissed at him like a cat. You should have seen the look on his face. When I realized what I'd done, I tried to recover by being macho ""Yeah! That's right! I said it!"" He was in shock. Then we both busted out laughing. I swear that's true. I wish I'd been there to see the look on the face of whomever your kid hissed at. That had to be something else. I'm kind of proud of your kid. The point is ADHD people don't see things the way other people do. We have a lot to deal with and we're often just as confused about our own behavior as you are. I didn't know I had ADHD until 2 years ago. I learned a long time ago to make lemonade from life's little lemons.

Flu-like symptoms could be allergies, poison, cancer or just a cold. They're the first sign that something is wrong. The same with ADHD symptoms. Everyone has them at some point. They could be caused by ADHD or sleep deprivation or just having a bad day. The best thing to do is get professional help. Express your concerns about the medication and make an informed choice about whether it's right for your kid to take these meds. if it is ADHD, he'll always have it.

I didn't catch the military thing you said on my first pass. I was in the U.S. Army for a while. It definitely changed my life. I was Airborne (I jumped from flying planes.) I tried out for Special Forces (Green Beret's). This was back in the 1990's after the first gulf war. I had a lot of specialized training with extra tough instructors. But I never went to war. I just went back to my regular life with a lot of extra skills and no trauma. The experience nearly removed any sense of fear or urgency from my daily life in the civilian world. Honestly it takes a lot to scare me. When the crap hits the fan, I get this weird sense of calm and everything snaps into focus. I know EXACTLY what needs to be done to resolve the situation. I swear it's a gift. Everybody I know asks me for advice for some reason. It's always impressed my wife how I handle emergencies. My wife is the only person who gets under my skin. I can ignore people yelling at me. I never get worked up over pushy people or whatever. But my wife knows exactly how to get me so angry I can't even speak. I clean when I'm angry. Sometimes I think she does it just to make me do house work. I do think that my military experience installed some OCD tendencies into my life. On some levels I can't even comprehend my life before that. I had some journals that I'd written before and I have NO IDEA why I wrote that stuff. It was a big shift in the way I think and the way I see the world. I now have a ""professionalism"" mode that kicks in at work and makes me a model employee most of the time. But at home it's a different story. Your dad probably had it worse than I did. Even in the US Army they were a LOT tougher in the 1940's than they were in the 1990's. I can only imagine what the German military was like back then. I'd imagine an experience like that could mess with a person's mind. I have no problem believing that military training could reinforce any existing OCD tendencies a person might have had all along. They can definitely install new instincts and habits. They train you to do something until it becomes automatic and you don't have to think about it. They train you to react to certain things in specific ways. I think that counts as some kind of compulsion. That's my 2 cents worth. I probably should go do something useful now. - Chris",2.7,1.5,F
add_and_adhd_exchange,2120_3,"A few years ago my nephew was diagnosed with ADHD. Followed by his mom, my other sister, my brother and my dad. I was the last one to be evaluated. I knew I was a bit different in 3rd grade. That year I started visiting the guidance councilor. She asked me a lot of questions, had me draw a lot and watch cartoons. She used a puppet named Do-So Dolphin to explain how to behave in class. I liked it because it was just more entertaining that whatever the 'normal kids' were doing. That year I did so well on the annual testing, that I was a candidate for the Gifted program. I qualified for that too, but my grades weren't up to par so it was over after the first quarter. It was also the first year I was held back a grade. I barely skinned by 4th and 5th. But 6th grade was the pinnacle of public school idiocy. As usual, I qualified for gifted but my grades weren't high enough. This time they had me take an extra test where I found out that I have a high IQ whatever that was. They said it means I'm a bit smarter than most people my age. I thought if I'm the smart one, the Earth is doomed. They also said I had trouble remembering things. I tried out for ""6th Sense Team"" and made it. We competed with other schools Jeopardy style. We finished that year in second for the county. I got a T-Shirt!!! Oh and I was held back that year, didn't pass summer school, repeated 6th grade,qualified for gifted, failed again, and finally passed summer school on my second try. I skinned by until 9th when I quit school. I took adult vocational classes to learn computers, got an a ward for scoring high on the GED and graduated on time. I joined the Army and got kicked out, married a lesbian and got divorced, beat up a gun toting mugger with a broom and spent one night in jail for fighting with my brother in my parents front yard. I had an interesting career most of it in computers and most of it in weird places. I've had a lot of personal conflict. I've always tried to fit in and failed. I've been angry at the school, my parents and the world for making ""normal"" seem like something real. What would my life have been like if they'd diagnosed me properly in 3rd grade? Who would I be? An A student? College Graduate? Insurance salesman or executive? Adventurer? I realize now, that I don't care. I am who I am because of my life. I had to forgive everyone I was angry at for all of these years including myself before I could relax. I've said that I feel more like my younger self now that I know why I had trouble. I think the reason for that is I haven't been myself since 3rd grade. Before that I didn't know I was different and didn't care. I'm in that place again except, I know I'm different, but I don't care. Nobody is normal anyway. The medicine helps, but it's not the reason I feel better about life.

That's all. I didn't mean to assume anything. Please clarify which ""assumptions are way off base."" The content of your post ""appears"" to equate treatment with drugs. It seems like you are saying you would not pay for the kid to go to college unless she takes drugs. Amy I wrong about that? Are you saying something else? I appreciate that your profession puts you in a position to see people with psychiatric problems. I wouldn't presume to discount your knowledge and experience. However, seeing people who need help isn't the same as being someone who needs help. Please keep that in mind. I'm proud of your family.

I made a mistake about the age of your kids. Probably mixed you up with someone else. (I do that sometimes.) I didn't have those circumstances as a kid. My parent's meant well, but they just weren't equipped mentally or financially to put 4 kids through college or even pay their mortgage on time. They hit some hard times and things just didn't work out. I don't think I would have been any better off at home than I was on my own, except it wouldn't have been as much of a tight-rope walk. My kid probably has ADHD. She's a lot like me. After all I've been through, I know that ADHD people can do anything anyone else can. They may not be able to do it the same way. I'm teaching her that it's OK to be different. I'm teaching her that she can succeed and that failure is only temporary. We learn more from our failures than we do from our successes. When she falls, I help her up, let her try again until she gets it. Then I leave her to it. I don?t get in her way. If I were in the same situation as the parent who started this post, I'd support my kid's decision not to take meds, but I'd make sure she had a plan to deal with the situation. Maybe she takes a few less classes or whatever. No matter what I won't deny her the chance to succeed. I'm not stupid. I won't let her be one of those career students still in college and no job at 40. But I?m not going to tell her she can't even try if she doesn't take meds. I won't punish her for car accidents and failed classes that haven't happened yet. She'll never succeed if she doesn't have a chance to fail. There's no way I'd deny her the chance to go to college even if she chose not to take meds. I think that sums it up. Please let me know what's wrong with anything I've said.

add_and_adhd_exchange,923_0,"I've been on Adderall for more than a year now. I have exactly the same problems. I've posted about it here. Dry Mouth: This is a common problem with Adderal for sure and maybe other stimulant meds. My dentist mentioned meth addicts have bad teeth because their mouth dries out and the saliva doesn't protect their teeth against bacteria. This is something you need to take seriously for more than just bad breath. Advice: Drink water and carry some gum with xylotol in it everywhere. Put some in your desk and your car if it's not too hot. Carry some in your pocket or purse if your a purse / man bag type of person. Starbucks gum works, but it's more expensive than the grocery store brands. I usually pick some up at the dollar store every now and then. The gum also helps with teeth clenching. Sometimes I tend to clench my teeth unconsciously on the meds. It was giving me tooth aches. I talked to my doc and he reduced my dose a bit. It still happens sometimes, but not as much. The gum helps. Emotions: Grumpy, Depressed, Tired and sad: I have the same problem. I've posted about it here. It usually happens during the period when the meds are wearing off. I feel awful. My wife, my kid, the cat, the phone pretty much anything annoys the heck out of me and I feel really sad and depressed. The more intense feelings usually don't last more than an hour, two on a bad day. Then it's kind of like it didn't happen at all. My doctor called it a mini-withdrawal. It happens because our body changes gears as the stimulants wear off. It's part of the reason we can't just stop taking them cold turkey. We have to reduce the dose slowly to prevent problems. Advice: Talk to your doctor about this stuff. There might be something going on. Maybe your dose isn't quite right or something else. The doctor can help you figure things out. I did that. Now I know what to expect, I can feel it coming on and go take a nap or something. Ideally I like to time my meds so it happens at bed time. Hopefully, I'll sleep thought it. Some more thoughts. I got along fine for 37 years without meds. I knew I wasn't quite ""normal"" but I didn't really care once I got out into the world on my own. Now that I know what it's like to be a ""normal"" person, I'm more critical of myself than I used to be and I wonder about my ability to function without them. When I forget to take the meds, I feel fine. I'm bouncing off the walls and kind of silly. It feels good to be myself, but I don't like screwing up all the time. I'm much more critical of myself than I used to be. When I mess up, I get angry with myself for the mistake and for for depending on the meds to help me not make mistakes. I don't like that feeling. I hope this makes sense. I guess I'm saying I'm glad the meds help me to be more organized and make fewer mistakes. But using them makes me feel more uptight and less accepting of who I really am and that makes me kind of sad. It helps to recognize the meds are a tool. They're not a cure. I'm trying to scale back and use them when I have to do something important and my ADHD won't matter much. We can minimize the problems caused by ADHD with smart lifestyle changes that we can handle when we're ourselves even without meds. We can't change who we are, but we can learn to live with ourselves and still do what needs to be done. It's all about balance. Good luck. - Chris",3.6,5.2,F

All I can remember was I had a high IQ for my age, short term memory problems and I wasn't very good at math. My Reading and Writing were really high even for most people. It was off the scale for kids my age. I don't think they knew about ADHD in the 1970's because they didn't detect it. I was ""Gifted"" in school but I wasn't allowed to stay in the program because of bad grades. (I kept forgetting to turn in my homework.) BTW: I was a computer programmer when I was younger. I'm actually good at math, but I suck at arithmetic. I'm good at figuring out formulas and abstractions. I just have trouble with actual numbers. I think there's a distinction in those test for that, but it was a long time ago. I'm also ADHD combined type. I'm Inattentive and Distracted not hyper. I have problems with working memory and uh... other stuff. Oppositional Defiance Disorder and Significant OCD tendencies. ADHD Combined Type is often associated with low motivation and lethargy. The Ritalin should help you with that. Once your head clears you feel better because you're not bogged down by all of the stuff in your head. I used to have so much going on in my mind, that I'd just get paralyzed and give up on doing anything because I couldn't figure out what I should be doing. The meds helped me get past that. Keep in mind, the doctor doesn't know who much medicine you need yet. They usually start you off on a low dose and ramp up from there until they find the dose that works for you. My advice is don't take that stuff on the weekends or when you don't need to be focused. If you take it every day, the effectiveness drops off and they raise your dose. I'm struggling with that now. My wife says the Adderall makes me friendlier and less irritable. I also like having a clear head. So I typically take them daily. Even on weekends. They've had to increase my dose twice now. If I keep on this way, they'll probably have to change meds because these will stop working and they won't be able to increase the dose anymore.

add_and_adhd_exchange,919_1,"It's good he's going to a psychiatrist. ADHD and bi-polar are very similar. The doc can help him find out what the real problem is and hopefully get your family on the right treatment plan. The reason I said your family would be on the treatment plan is ADHD is not a curable condition. He's always going to be the same guy he is now. He's always going to need help in certain areas. The good thing is knowing WHY he does or doesn't do things can be a big relief. He's not screwing up on purpose. It's a lot easier to laugh off some of the stuff that used to bug you when you know ""It's not me. It's my ADHD."" When he sees the doc, he'll have to get some evaluations and tests. Sometimes they have a pretty good idea right away. Sometimes they need to do brain scans and so on. It may take some time to decide the right path. For me it took several months of talking about stuff I don't like to think about much before the doc decided on ADHD and not bipolar. When he starts taking the meds, he's going to have to figure out which dose works and how to time them so they work without messing things up even more. It's a tricky thing to figure out. Good communication with the doctor is critical if you want to get it right. When he's not on his meds. He's going to be himself again. ADHD and all. It's not a bad thing if you figure out some lifestyle changes to minimize the negative aspects of his ADHD. There is absolutely no reason why you can't start working on that right now. I mean the meds are a help, but they're no cure. There are plenty of non-medical / drug ways to help people get organized, even whole families. Everybody has ADHD symptoms at some point in their lives, it's just not everyone has them ALL the time. So there are plenty of resources to help you find out what you can do to handle each specific issue on its own. For example chronic tardiness or forgetfulness can be addressed quite effectively exactly the same way non ADHD people handle it. Use calendars and reminders and the good old fashioned check list. The truth is he'll never be cured, but with the right support system in place, it won't matter much. Mistakes will happen. That's an indisputable fact, but you'll know what kind of mistakes to expect and you can work out a system to minimize their impact. Get started on that now. Why wait? You'll need patience and understanding while your husband and the doc figure out what works. But at least you'll know why he does what he does. That's a big relief in itself. Believe me. Don't sweat the small stuff. Just try to take care of the big things and everything will be OK. Good luck. - Chris",3.7,5.4,P

add_and_adhd_exchange,1077_0,"Go ahead and schedule that meeting with the teacher as soon as possible. There are several reasons for this. First, you want to get input from the teacher that you'll need for the evaluation. ADHD has to effect at least 2 areas of your life before you can get a diagnosis. The input from the teacher will go a long way toward helping the doctor figure out what kind of treatment plan will help. Second, you want to get a feel for the teacher and how she's interacting with your kid. Make sure there isn't just a personality conflict between your kid and the teacher or your kid and some of the other kids in class. If your kid is sitting next to the class clown, she may get caught up in their antics. Maybe they just need to move her to a different table so she doesn't get distracted as much. Third, you want to find out how well she's doing. If she's performing above the standards for a Kindergarten student, she may be ready for advanced classes or a gifted program, or whatever they call the extra stuff they do for smart kids at your school. I was 37 when I was diagnosed. I had a lot of problems in school. I won't go into the details this time. The main point is I had undiagnosed ADHD and a high IQ. I was bored frustrated and unchallenged. The work they had me do was so easy that I could knock it out in no time, but I can't sit still and wait for everyone else to finish so I'd zone out or read or talk or whatever. I failed several grades because I couldn't get my homework in on time if at all. Every year I started in advanced classes and the gifted program due to placement test scores. Then they'd move me to ""special"" classes for slow learners for the second half of the year. I hated every minute of it. I couldn't figure out why they were messing with my head telling me I was smart and stupid at the same time. As a teen, I was so frustrated that I rebelled against all authority because I thought nobody knew what they were doing. I quit school and did things my own way. I got by OK, but my life was a big mess until I met my wife. It wouldn't have been that way if I'd been properly diagnosed in school and placed in advanced classes. Make sure you keep up with your daughter's progress. Maybe she's just a 5 yo with a high IQ and she's bored. Maybe she has ADHD and you'll have to learn how to deal with that. Meds are a tool, but they won't cure anything. You'll have to teach her how to survive in the real world. Believe me the school system is the LAST place you should go for that. They're all about testing and making sure enough Child Units pass to keep their funding. As an institution, they don't have the time or the motivation to work with individual kids. There are good caring teachers, but they have to meet the schools goals so they don't have enough time or money to do the right thing as well as they'd like. It's up to you. Don't worry about not being able to see what's in front of her face. My wife is all grown up and doesn't have ADHD. She can't find her nose in front of her face. We got in to an argument once because she couldn't find some expensive bottle of face lotion and she ""asked"" (yelled at me) to help her find it. I opened the closet and it was right there. She swore I'd done some David Copperfield type of magic just to mess with her head. When you deal with an ADHD kid, you have to learn the way their mind works. It's not as hard as you might think. Mind your manners. Don't yell at her. Keep your instructions simple. Only ask for one thing at a time. ""Ok. Go get your socks and come back."" When she returns ""Ok. Put on the socks."" and so on. Yeah. It's hard at first, but you get used to it. When she makes a mistake. Give her the chance to fix it. Don't assume she knows what the mistake is. You may have to show her. Some days are better than others, but it can be done with our without meds. Frankly it's easier to deal with girls. Girls just get distracted. Boys are like tornadoes. Good luck",3.1,4.5,P
add_and_adhd_exchange,928_4,"When you make your appointment, they'll ask you what you think the problem is. The only reason they do that is to get the right information and materials ready for the doc to use during your appointment. Talking to the doc is like talking to a mechanic. They'll ask you questions. You'll answer. They'll ask you other questions. Some may seem to have nothing at all to do with the problem. That's just the process of elimination. They'll ask you about things that may indicate some other problem you didn't even know about. Eventually, they'll decide what to try first. It can take a while to get the whole story. I was diagnosed with ADHD a bit more than a year ago at the age of 37. After at least a year of visits, we find out that I have ""significant OCD tendencies"" apparently, it's the light version of OCD. It's not something to ignore, but I don't need meds to control it. The human mind is incredibly complicated. The doctors know what they're doing, but they still need time to do their job. FYI: The test I started with at the doctors office was exactly the same little quiz I found here. So if you think you have a problem you probably should see a doctor to get some help figuring it all out. You're not the only person who ever had anxiety about ADHD or any mental condition. You're also not the first one who showed up confused and worried at the doctors office. They know what to do. You just have to answer their questions honestly and be open about your thoughts and feelings. The doctors need accurate information to make the best decisions. Holding things back only slows the process down. At least that's how it worked for me. Anyway. Good luck. Let us know how the appointment goes, if you want to share. I'm pulling for you. - Chris",4.4,3.4,P
add_and_adhd_exchange,745_10,"Ally and Nates Mommy, You are SO right. It feels good to know I'm not the only one. I've realized that preparation is the key. If I'm going to be on-time, I have to leave REALLY early. I can't watch TV or read e-mail for 15 minutes then leave for an appointment. I'll forget about the appointment and never actually read my e-mail. I get ready to go, then just GO. I'll wait in the lobby with my iPod or a book. If I don't I'll be late. That happened the day I was being tested for ADHD. I was late and had to re-schedule. LOL I actually love lists, but I can't make one ahead of time. I use it as an extension of my short term memory. Cooking for example. A recipe is a paragraph with ingredients listed at the bottom. I can't follow it. Instead, I type it up as a list of steps and ingredients, with space for notes. I check things off and make notes as I go. If I don't. I may stop half way through and start over because I can't be sure if I REALLY put something in once, twice or not at all. My work area is always clean and orderly, with utensils in order and ingredients in separate containers like a NASA experiment or Food network. I have to be able to SEE everything at a glance because I can't remember it for more than a minute. My wife is the opposite. She jumps in recipe in hand, flour in her hair dirty pots and pans everywhere. She calls me every 5 minutes to get something from the top shelf, or stir a pot. Yet she pulls it off in half the time I do and it's always good. I have to drive a certain route. Towels have to be folded just so. My tools HAVE to be in the right place or I can't work. Everything else has always been chaos though. When people don't do something the ""RIGHT"" way, I want to rip it out of their hands and do it for them. Inside my brain is about to explode every time I see it. I have to fight the urge to scream. I think it's because I find a technique I can remember and I latch onto it like an anchor in storm. I have no problems with kids for some reason. I've always talked to my daughter like she was a person who didn't know things yet. Not as a pet like some people. I answer her questions as honestly as I think she can handle it and if she makes a mistake, I help her fix it. The next time, she REALLY tries to get it right. When she was 4 everyone thought she was 6 because she's tall and VERY articulate. Now she's 5 and asks me questions I have to research to answer. LOL Everybody says I'm great with kids and ask me for advice. The thing is I can't really explain it. I just go with the flow. I think it's because EVERYONE was always on my case to get it together etc growing up. I just don't think kids need that kind of crap. I'm not patient with adults or people I think should already know the ""RIGHT"" way. LOL Oh yea, my 5 year old has a better memory than I do. She's started helping me to remember things and even gives me advice on how NOT to be late getting her to school. I'm so proud of her. (Got misty eyed for a second there.) I HATE PEOPLE TOUCHING ME! Even shaking hands with a stranger is bad. I hate crowds too. When we go to Disney World or even the grocery store, I have to be careful. The crowds and people bumping into me make me crazy. Sometimes I'm fine, then suddenly people around me start to look like one big cloud of chaos. I couldn't pick ONE person out of the crowd because they look like one big thing. I'll get this twisty feeling in my head like I'm drowning or something and I have to move to a quiet area with some elbow room until it clears up and I can think. I'm not antisocial. I'm friendly enough, I just don't usually click with people I meet. It's just hard to finds friend that can put up with all of the ADHD stuff. It seems like it's not worth the trouble.

People with ADHD show differences in brain scans. Brain and biochemical differences are not caused by a lack of quality time with parents. I certainly would not consult a Pastor, Priest, or Rabbi about a medical disorder unless they held medical degrees. The majority of clergy do not and the reputable ones will refer you to someone who has a medical degree. I too have a 12 year old son. He plays hockey, baseball and football.

add_and_adhd_exchange,1493_9,"Psychiatrists do not ""enjoy"" writing prescriptions. It is not a form of recreation for them. As a ""recent high school graduate"" you are very young, inexperienced and lack advanced education. A child psychiatrist is the professional who should be consulted when ADHD is suspected. ADHD is not all about grades. There are many other facets of life that usually are effected. Most parents try other forms of support before turning to medication. That is obvious. It sounds as if you may have had other problems. ADHD is not correlated with being ""bitter and cynical."" ADHD symptoms are hyperactivity, inattention, impulsivity. You can look it up as well. I'm sure therapy was very helpful for you. My youngest takes medication, plus receives many different kinds of support for his ADHD. The fact that a child takes medication does not negate other methods of support. I have two sons who have taken medication for ADHD/ADD. It was not effective for one (ADD) and the other (ADHD) is on medication currently. Neither boy suffered from mood swings nor have they been ""altered"" as persons nor are they zombies. I have also worked with many children over the years who have taken medication for ADHD who have experienced the same. If a child is having a reaction to the medication, that parent can discuss this with the child's psychiatrist. I'm sure people with diabetes would rather not require medications as well. I have to take medications for certain conditions an it is not enjoyable either. It is something one learns as one matures. There are things in life that are necessary and not ""enjoyable."" As for ""ADHD medications are drugs""... all medications are drugs. That is why a physician must write a prescription and one must obtain the medication at a pharmacy. Many, if not most medications have the potential for abuse. One does not throw the baby out with the bath water so to speak, because some people choose to abuse them.

add_and_adhd_exchange,885_4,"Sandie Thanks for your reply. I've been wrestling with this OCD possibility for a few weeks. I read (part of) the book the doc suggested. From what I can tell, there are two areas of my life that appear to be a bit like OCD. Neither of them is what I'd expressed concern about. I initially complained about how I get stuck on doing things, like writing WebMD posts or building Lego models or projects or whatever. That's the reason the doc had me read up on OCD. That getting stuck on a task thing isn't caused by any OCD triggers that I can find. I think it's actually just an extended period of procrastination. Right now, I'd rather be writing this than sleeping, so I put off going to bed over and over again until I just can't ignore it anymore. It's not because I'm worried about what will happen if I don't finish it. or any compulsion to make it perfect. It's just less boring than whatever else I have to do. The OCD things were a surprise to me. I didn't realize what was going on until I started reading up on OCD. I have this problem with absolutes. For example when I was taking the evaluations for ADHD and OCD, I picked the questions apart and couldn't decide how to answer them because of the word ""EVER"". That word is an absolute. For example ""Do you EVER feel sad?"" ; Yeah. I've felt sad at some point in my life. It may have been 20 years ago, but It's within the scope of ""EVER"", so the answer is ""YES"". So do I mark ""YES"" or ""NO""? I couldn't decide. It took me forever to finish those evals. Some of them had more than one check mark, or I'd circle something or X something else out. I'm a computer guy, so that type of thinking is actually useful most of the time. It hardly ever causes me a problem in my daily life. The other problem I have is similar. I have trouble gauging the scope of a question or statement when someone is talking to me. Maybe they're talking about some small thing, but I think they're talking about something much bigger or more important. It also happens when I read instructions or safety information on tools or chemicals like paint or whatever. I recently spent several days trying to figure out what kind of paint to use on galvanized metal. The instructions said ""don't use this product on galvanized metal."" Somehow I got the idea that it would probably cause some kind of chemical reaction and kill somebody or start a fire or whatever. It turns out , the paint just doesn't stick to galvanized metal because of the zinc coating. My mind never even considered the simplest explanation. I jumped right to the worst possible extreme. That happens a lot. I actually find it kind of useful so I don't think I'll seek OCD treatment unless it somehow impairs my normal life. My sister does have OCD. But her ""symptoms"" are much more extreme than anything I've seen in myself. I gave her the book rather than take it back to the store, because I think she'll get some use out of it. I'm just going to tell the doc ""Never mind. I'll let you know if I have any problems."" Thanks for replying. Thanks for reading this. - Chris",3.3,2.3,P

My oldest was valedictorian in high school. My youngest is working towards his Eagle Scout. Yes, they likely may need medication, more structure and support form parents as well as social skills training, behavioral managment and more home-school communication and partnership. Yes, it is more work but the outcome is worth it. I'd start with a child psychiatrist. Parenting/education classes for parents of ADHD children can be very helpful. ADHD is really not ""outgrown.""

I started going to the gym, working out and taking yoga. I also became a member of a book club with other women and we also see movies and local plays. It is easier for me as one son is an adult and the other one is almost 13. :<O Have you thought about going to family counseling?

He can complete one and he may or may not advise medication. You as a parent can refuse medical treatment i.e. medication if you so choose.

Extract"If you have migraines, you need to keep going back to your doctor when he asks you to return if you are not better. If you do not return, he assumes you have improved with the last medicine he gave you. There are lots of different kinds of preventative and rescue meds to try for migraines, often you try them each for 4-6 weeks, then if you are not better, you go back and try a different one. I can<APO>t think of anything you could have done to damage your head in the situation you described, but a CT or MRI is often done to rule out any serious brain problem with new headaches so if you haven<APO>t had one, ask your doctor if it would be appropriate. Take care, Annette""I would discuss this with your pharmacist and doctor. Most people who are allergic to ""sulfa"" drugs, mistakenly say sulfur. There is no reason that I know of why someone who is allergic to sulfa drugs would not be able to be treated with the opiates. I looked up morphine and methadone and neither mention any cross sensitivity for folks with allergies to sulfa drugs. Nor does it mention sulfur allergy as a problem. I looked them up in a nursing drug handbook. Sulfur is a naturally occurring mineral, sulfa drugs are entirely synthetic. Take care, Annette""I looked into Botox injections for migraines years ago, but the research was not good for that indication at that time. I would have had them in a minute. The needles they use are very tiny compared to the spinal needles and other injection needles. Learn some relaxation techniques: slow abdominal breathing, visual imagery, progressive relaxation, etc. That can help you a lot. Meanwhile call the office back again and ask again if he can call you in a mild anxiolytic drug to help deal with your anxiety. Ask how long before the procedure you should take it, you don<APO>t want it to wear off before you begin. If you threaten to cancel the procedure they may respond faster, or they may say ""cancel it"", so that one is up to you. Take care, Annette Take care, Annette""I agree with Dave. Surgery sounds like a blessing that will save you from a life time in pain right now? Unfortunately, it only helps about 50% of the time, and the doctors have no way of telling if it will even work on someone, it is pretty much a crap shoot. Once they find a way of narrowing down the patient pool to the patients that surgery will actually help, they will have much better results. Try to hold out until then if you feel this is the route you want to go. I personally feel the risk of going off the coumadin is far greater than staying on it and not having surgery. But, that is a personal decision. Take care, Annette""Ask your pharmacist to be sure if you are concerned. I have seem them prescribed together before. The flexeril may be causing the dry mouth, that is a common side effect. Tramadol can also cause a dry mouth, but not as often. Sugar free hard candies can help with the dry mouth. Or regular hard candies if you can stand the calories. Brush your teeth often, as a dry mouth can cause cavities. Take care, Annette""Why are you afraid you have cauda equina syndrome? What would that have to do with falling asleep with your head on the back of your chair? What do you mean by ""I<APO>m spotty with my voiding functions""? Take care, Annette""Is what you want narcotics? You don<APO>t even say what your symptoms are. 150 mg. a day of tramadol is not a high dose, you can take up to 400 mg. a day (with a doctor<APO>s prescription of course). Do you have any history of alcoholism or drug abuse? Why won<APO>t you take non-narcotic meds? Why won<APO>t they give them to you? Do they feel they aren<APO>t necessary, are you a risky patient to prescribe them to? Take care, Annette""I had a C5-6 discectomy without a fusion. I would have been in the hospital 2 nights, 3 days total, except I developed a blood clot in my leg that required another 6 days of hospitalization. I was in the hospital a total of 9 days. Then I was on anticlotting meds for another six months. Maybe he can do one on his lunch hour (he must get a long lunch), but he won<APO>t have the pain or possible complications, recovery time, etc. that goes along with having major surgery. And you are paying for his ""bread and butter"". I was still able to go back to work in 6 weeks, full time ER nursing, 12 hour shifts with no restrictions. My neurosurgeon told me if I had a fusion also it would have been 12 weeks. And a lot more pain. I have heard the pain in the hip from the donor site is worse than the pain in the neck. I did not do my surgery for pain relief, but for loss of function. That was restored immediately. You should have two surgical opinions from different surgeons who do not practice in the same group. Ask them both a lot of questions, and write down the answers to compare. How are you making arrangements for after your surgery, if you did not ask all these questions of your surgeon? Are you doing this for pain relief or loss of function in your hands? What does your doctor consider successful? What do you consider successful? Make sure you are both on the same page. Take care, Annette""I had an anterior approach for my discectomy (no fusion).I had no real trouble swallowing afterwards. I did have numbness along my neck for several years after the surgery, not total numbness, but partial with a definite change in feeling when I stroked my neck with my finger. It still feels a little different, I had my surgery in 1992. I had had difficulty with my right hand, and the herniation was pressing inward on my spinal cord, osteophytes were noted on my MRI. My hand function was normal immediately after the surgery. Unfortunately, six months after the surgery, I was rear-ended and herniated the disc above with the same outcome, pressure on the spinal cord. I have developed new osteophytes. This time I had no trouble with my hands so I opted to not have any further surgery. Take care, Annette""Ditto what Swank said. I am also concerned that she fell twice, once into a wall with her shoulder, and once 4 feet onto her hip. Nurses are always taught to ask about domestic abuse in that scenario, as well as look into anything else that may cause frequent injuries. What<APO>s up with all the falling? That is not normal. She needs to see a doctor. Take care, Annette""I<APO>ve had neither. I had one injection into a very painful spot that did work, but hurt really bad, nothing minor about that pain. It was worth it to me. The original pain has not come back at the original severity. That one shot also cost me $200 above what my insurance company paid. My question would be why increase pain, minor or not, if the injection is not likely going to work at all? The evidence of many injections and radio frequency ablation is pretty poor for relief. Your history of 20 injections and RFA that did not work, would point me away from these treatments if I were considering them. Good luck with your own quest for relief. Take care, Annette""I have been thinking good thoughts for you also. How did it go? Take care, Annette""Please go back and see your doctor again. If you have had this pain all along, tell him that. If the initial pain went away, came back, and this feels the same to you, tell him that. If this feels completely different, tell him that. Be sure to tell him if you have any other symptoms at all, even if they seem unrelated, like nausea, jaw pain, arm pain, sweats, etc. Take care, Annette""The problem with buying any kind of supplements in the US is that they are completely unregulated as to purity, strength, etc. A study some years ago showed that when examined in the laboratory supplements had anywhere from 0-300% of the dose stated on the label, in addition to that they also found a great deal of heavy metals and some prescription drugs as impurities. When this study came out, the rheumatologist that I was seeing at the time told all of his patients to stop taking any supplements at all. He had been trained in Germany where they treat supplements the same as pharmaceuticals, and have quality assurance in the same way. he said when they do that in the US, he will again support using some of them. I do not know anything about the supplement you are using specifically. I would consult your doctor about this treatment, and ask him what he thinks of it. Natural does not mean non-toxic. Think of curare, or cocaine, these are both natural substances and both can kill you. Take care, Annette""Although they call it restless leg syndrome, the symptoms can happen all over the body, not just in the legs. It can also happen in the daytime, not just at night. I started taking Ambien about ten years ago, and it helped me sleep better. When I started taking neurontin for FMS pain, that seemed to really help the RLS also. My husband said I wasn<APO>t moving around in bed as much, and I stopped wearing holes in the bottom sheets from kicking my feet. Some anti-Parkinson<APO>s drugs are also used for RLS. Sinemet comes to mind, but there are others also. Tell the rheumy again that it is keeping you from sleeping and ask if there is there anything he can do? If he feels like he doesn<APO>t know what to do, ask him for a referral to another doctor for help. Don<APO>t take nothing for an answer. Or you could ask your pcp if you feel he would be more helpful, but I would start with the rheumy myself. Take care, Annette""Nyquil (I believe), excedrin PM and Benadryl all contain the same drug, so you may be overdosing. Plain generic Benadryl (diphenhydramine), will do the same thing, without the extra components in the other drugs. Lorazepam is a benzo and can be easily abused and/or addictive so please don<APO>t double up on them. Tell your doctor it isn<APO>t working. You can try the regular generic zolpidem rather than the ambien CR and see if that works. Or ask the doctor for one of the anti-Parkinson<APO>s drugs used for RLS rather than just piling sleep aids on you. Before the neurontin I used to get up and walk my dog at 3 am for 45 minutes, then take a hot bath and go back to bed. Try the yoga stuff the other person suggested, it may help. Take care, Annette""All I know about this med is that it is generally used to treat opioid induced constipation. Although I am only familiar with giving it subcutaneously, I believe there are pills available now also. Take care, Annette""Call your insurance program and ask them about a pain management program close enough for you to go to. It is unreasonable to expect you to drive 100 miles to see a specialist regularly. They may have an appeals program and tell you how to go about getting an exception. You can also ask your old pain management doctor if he will join the insurance program you belong to. Several doctors have done that for my hubby and I. It means some extra paperwork for them, but they will reap the monetary benefits so they will often do it. Take care, Annette""Many pain management programs do have addiction specialists that work with them. It sounds like this would be a better program for him than a pain management doctor alone. If your friend<APO>s doctor dose not have an addiction doctor in his clinic he may still have one that he works with at times that he can refer patients to. Many addicts still need pain meds and do get them, but are under more strict supervision than patients who do not have addiction problems. Take care, Annette""Some doctors are more skilled than others at keeping sources confidential. You should assume however that your boyfriend will figure out where the doctor got such personal information. The doctor only sees him very briefly once a month at the most, it would be easy for your boyfriend to hide the signs of addiction from him. The nose may not deteriorate for some time after snorting regularly, so that is a late rather than an early sign. You are the only one who can decide what to do. Take care, Annette""It doesn<APO>t matter how much pain he has, he is abusing the drugs, and I am positive he has not told his doctor he is snorting, chewing, or shooting his meds. That is not how the doctor prescribed the meds. His doctor probably sees him once a month or less, for 5-10 minutes. Most people can keep up an act for that long. I agree with the others that said you should call the doctor and tell him the truth about how he is abusing the meds. Let the doctor deal with it. He is trained to do so. If it comes down to you or the drugs, leave. You may save his life. You leaving may be the bottom of the barrel for him. If you leave he may see that he really has a problem. Or he may not, but you deserve better than to wake up with him dead next to you. It is not your job to be his mommy and hold his pills for him and try to keep him straight and sober. That is his job. I will keep good thoughts for you both. Take care, Annette""Glad it went okay. I am not a fan of soft collars, don<APO>t use it any longer than she told you to, and then do not use it on your own, always ask the doctor first. My neurosurgeon and my pcp both told me that the soft collars really don<APO>t relieve the pressure on your neck, you need a hard collar to do that. In addition to that, the muscles in your neck lose tone within 3-4 days while wearing a collar, so you end up with a weaker neck than when you started. They both suggested neck exercises to strengthen my neck muscles and relax any spasms I was having. Their explanation made sense to me. They both also said one should not drive a car in any kind of collar because of the decreased range of motion in the neck, and decreased vision due to the decreased range of motion. Let us know how the botox works. Take care, Annette""The soft collars fasten in the back, not the front. The curve of the collar should fit under your chin. Make sure when you buy one to take it out of the package and try it on first. Fit is VERY important. It should gently remind you to hold your head still on your shoulders, it should not feel really tight. If you are too small for the small size adult, you may need a large size kid<APO>s collar. I knew a lady once who was so petite she wore GRR Animals clothes from the kid<APO>s dept. of the store, she had an 18 year old child, lol. Go ahead and wear it until you get a hold of the doctor or her nurse, then ask them how long you should wear it. If they say just until you feel better, I would give it about three days, then see how it goes without it. If necessary I would put it back on, but I would call the doctor again at that point. That is just me, you have to do what you feel is right for you. I have never had Botox so I don<APO>t know how long one would wear this for that indication. Once it is off, ask the doctor if you need to do any strengthening exercises to help strengthen your neck muscles, you may or may not need to. Take care, Annette""Don<APO>t worry about it. I get the email digest so I just scroll down the emails and often respond before reading posts further along. It can get confusing. Take care, Annette""I did respond to your post, it sounds like only part of it stuck in your mind. What I said was to wear it like your doctor said, only as long as she said to wear it, and then not to use it on your own later without discussing it with your doctor first. A soft collar will remind you to limit your range of movement while the Botox shots take effect, and I suspect that is what she gave it to you for. Some people once they get a soft collar will put it on when ever their neck is bothering them for the rest of their life. They don<APO>t discuss it with their doctor, they just drag it out of a drawer and put it on. I think that is a bad idea. I believe that it can weaken the neck muscles if used for too long or too often. Never worry about what you read on the internet to the point that you disobey your doctor<APO>s instructions. Read what you find, take notes, and take them to your doctor to discuss if you feel they apply to your problem. Your doctor is the one taking care of you and has examined you and usually knows best what is good for you. Doing our own research is good, but always discuss what you find with your own doctor. There is almost always more than one way to treat any problem. Different doctors use different methods and patients from both doctors still do fine. I may disagree with another doctor or nurse, but we can both be right. Never change your treatment plan in any way without discussing it with your doctor first, certainly not based on what you read on the internet. Take care, Annette""Go read my post after your response top me in the other thread. I hope I answered more of your questions. Take care, Annette""I would wear it until you speak to her and get your questions answered. No, I doubt it hurt anything by not wearing it. Hugs, Annette""I don<APO>t believe that using fentanyl patches will shorten your life. They were originally used in hospice care for terminal cancer patients, but now they are in common use for chronic pain. If my choice were to use them and be comfortable, and die a year earlier than I would have anyway, I would probably still opt to use them. I believe in quality of life, I don<APO>t see any point in being miserable and living a bit longer. That said, I have never read anything about them shortening ones life. My doctor offered them to me ten years ago, when I was 48. I opted not to use them because I adore my hot tub and was not willing to give that up. But I trust my doctor and doubt that she would offer me anything that would hurt me in anyway without telling me the risks ahead of time. I don<APO>t think there is a big difference in side effects among the opiates, they all seem to have the same side effect profile. I think you should use whatever you and your doctor decide is best for you. Hugs, Annette""MS Contin is a morphine pill that is made to last up to 12 hours. Avinza and Kadian are long acting morphine pills that are made to last up to 24 hours. Some patients and their doctors have tried other dosing schedules depending on how the patient responds to the meds. You should take all your meds exactly the way your doctor prescribes them, if they don<APO>t work, tell the doctor and try what he says. Take care, Annette""My opinion is that the MRI results really do not mean much in relation to your pain. They have done huge studies of people who have had MRIs of their backs. Many people with chronic back pain have normal discs in their back, and many people with terrible disc disease have no pain at all. The MRI is not a tool that consistently demonstrates who should have back pain and who should not. The MRI should show if there is any other problem in your back like tumors, etc. that could be a problem. As for treating your pain, I am in agreement with you, no surgery or injections for pain alone. I would find a comprehensive pain management clinic that uses many different approaches for pain control including oral meds. Then it is just a matter of trying the different things and using whatever works. Take care, Annette""I am really not surprised. An addict would tell himself that since the somas are not narcotics, he is not abusing them. Only you know how to handle this situation. If you think it would help, you might offer to go to the doctor with him, then tell the doctor that the somas do not work properly and describe what happens when he takes them. I would not ever take another soma again. I took one once years ago and my body shut down just like you describe. My house could have burned down around me and I would have just laid there. After 6-8 hours I was able to move again and flushed the rest of the RX down the toilet. Take care, Annette""I have been taught the same thing about people who ask for soma and opiates together, a big, red flag for possible drug abuse. It may not always be true, but it is true often enough that I would never encourage people to use the two types of drugs together or ask a doctor for the two at the same time. I would be happy if Soma were taken off the market all together. Take care, Annette""Nice to know it wasn<APO>t just me. However, now I didn<APO>t get my email digests for today. I am signed up for four different ones, and got none of them. I went to the email digest page and deleted all of the times and rechecked them and resubmitted them, but no use so far. Take care, Annette""I got my email digests for yesterday and today. Thanks. Take care, Annette""You can<APO>t self diagnose or get an accurate diagnosis on line. You need to go see a doctor in person. Take care, Annette""There are many free or low cost clinics available, but they can be hard to find. Mostly they do not advertise. Check with the local Goodwill, Salvation Army, and Catholic Charities. Your county health department may know of low cost clinics or they may even have primary care clinics themselves. You can Google for ""free/low cost clinics in<UD><UD><UD><UD><UD><UD>"" fill in the blank with your county, city, whatever. Volunteers In Medicine run a lot of free/low cost clinics all over the country, you could Google them also. Good luck. Take care, Annette""Sometimes people continue to have pain or the pain comes back after a week or so. It is often caused by a smaller stone that was left in what is left of the common bile duct. This can sometimes be taken care of using a scope down the esophagus, stomach, etc. I don<APO>t know if that is your problem or not. Take care, Annette""I would ask your present doctor to refer me to a pain management specialist who uses a large variety of pain management techniques including PT, OT, cognitive behavioral therapy, massage, acupuncture, biofeedback, TENS units, oral meds including opiates, and whatever injections or procedures are appropriate for my pain. I would not go to a pain management specialist who only does injections and procedures. You have to ask a lot of questions before you make your appt. I am 58 now and have used opiates daily for 10-15 years. I am dependent on them, but I am not addicted to them. I also use other pain management techniques. I believe you should use whatever tools work for you. I think that opiates should be used after other treatment methods have failed, but there is no reason to just let someone suffer in pain due to their age, that is so arbitrary. Take care, Annette""I do the same thing to make a paragraph, I hit enter twice whenever I want to make a paragraph. Like there, I did it. I also only post from a PC, I don<APO>t have the other devices hooked up for the internet. Take care, Annette""For those who are able to, I would really appreciate it if you would break up your posts into paragraphs. It makes it much easier to read them clear through. I hate to admit it, but sometimes I skip whole posts rather than try to read them all the way through. If you can<APO>t do this, or don<APO>t want to, that is entirely up to you. Thanks, Annette""Yes, I get the same kind of pain behind my knees. It is a burning pain for me. Almost like a severe sun burn feels. I use Lidoderm patches for it and they help a lot. I would get your blood sugar, Vit. B12 and Vit. D levels checked to be sure they are all normal. Just to be on the safe side. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I have been on a generic extended release morphine for about 10-11 years now. Cheaper than Avinza and I don<APO>t mind taking it twice a day instead of once a day. I also use Norco for breakthrough pain. I have found no reliable medical studies to show that any one opiate is better than another. I believe it is all in the dosing. When I need to change to another long acting med, I will give methadone a try. My friend used it after the morphine did not work well for him, and he found the methadone to work really well. When he went off of it, the taper was fairly fast and he had no withdrawal symptoms at all. Methadone is also really cheap. Take care, Annette""I absolutely agree with what Gail said. Methadone can be very dangerous for a person who has not already been on narcotic meds. People DO die from taking it, and not realizing how it works or what dose they should be on. it can also affect the electrical system of your heart. You are now an illegal drug user, whether you were before or not isn<APO>t important to your doctor. If it were me, I would never take another pill that was not prescribed to me, never tell a doctor I had done that, and start fresh with a new appt. at least a week after the last dose. By then my urine would be clean. By now you have already seen him and all I can say is I hope he didn<APO>t do a drug screen, because it would probably turn up positive. Take care, Annette""Often times the primary doctor just refers off of a list he has, they take turns taking patients. If your doctor actually knows the doc he is referring you to and feels like it would be a good fit for you, that is fine. But, if he is just giving you the next name on a list, you may want to do your own research first. The first orthopedist my husband was referred to for his total hip, was just the next name on a list. My husband had an active Staph infection in a partially healed wound, and the ortho wanted to just go ahead and do his hip right then. He did not ever touch my hubbie, except to shake hands. Yet, he charted that he did a full exam, with range of motion measurements, etc. We never went back and reported him to our primary care doc. I did the research and found the two most respected orthos in our area that did a lot of total hip replacements, my hubbie went and saw both of them, then he chose the surgeon he wanted. I would never have major surgery without thoroughly researching the doctor myself. Just my approach, not everyone has to follow it. Take care, Annette""I am sorry you are not getting more relief from the botox. Regretfully, I do not know what the time frame is for it to start working, you will have to ask your doctor. The fact that you can move your neck more to the right is a good sign. Did the doctor say if you would require multiple treatments? Take care, Annette""I saw his speech and he did address the malpractice issue. Insurance companies keep about 30% of the money we give them and pay the doctors, hospitals, etc. with the other 70%. I think we should eliminate the insurance companies altogether, that would be a 30% savings right there. I don<APO>t know why Obama took the single payer system off the table to begin with. I feel that is the direction we need to be going in. Take care, Annette""Vit B2 is a vitamin, it is not meant to treat an illness. I am not sure what you mean by ""working""? Take care, Annette""I am so glad things are going better for you. I hope it continues. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know what you mean by ""self medicating""? What kinds of drugs were you using and for how long? If you are telling the PM doc the same story as you told the methadone clinic when you signed up there things should not be too rough. My experience with methadone clinics for opiate abuse is pretty old, so I don<APO>t know what their requirements for entry are now. In the olden days you had to prove with documentation at least two years of opiate abuse, and at least two previous attempts at quitting drugs. If you have any history of dealing drugs, you will be hard put to find any doctor willing to prescribe controlled substances to you for fear you will divert them. No doctor must prescribe opiates to any patient. They can deny opiate meds to anyone they want to. I think the PM doc is correct in having you see an addictions specialist. RA, FMS, and scoliosis all have non-opiate treatments that you can try first anyway. No doctor begins treatment of any of those with opiates. Why aren<APO>t you asking about non-opiate treatments? Take care, Annette""Call the company that makes the urine screening tests and ask them what could make you have a false positive. A hair follicle test might be another option, it should show any drugs you have done for the last several months at least. Take care, Annette""I doubt the Norco has anything to do with any of your symptoms. Take care, Annette""Pain meds may cause urinary retention, but that just means you feel the need to urinate even after you just did, because the bladder is not emptying completely. Your body continues to make urine, it just has a hard time coming out. This is a rare side effect. It would not cause swelling in just one foot/ankle. Occasionally someone retains fluid in their tissues, but both legs would swell, not just one. You may indeed have cellulitis. Sometimes the first antibiotic they try does not work. Go back to the same doctor, and show her how you are doing. Let her see the foot/ankle and she may give you a different antibiotic to take. Is the swelling any worse, any better? Is the area hot to the touch, red? Does the swelling go down if you elevate the foot higher than your heart? Take care, Annette""Methadone especially in the higher dose range can cause electrical problems in the heart. Your PM doc may have decided that if you needed to go see a cardiologist, perhaps that was not the right drug for you to be on. I do not know why your pcp opted to send you to a cardiologist, one seldom goes to see one unless there is a problem. Take care, Annette""I agree with you, Teresakitty2. The sleep apnea is another consideration that might lead away from using opiates. Take care, Annette""Explain to your doctor that you seem to be getting a reputation that you do not like and ask him for another plan for when you have flares. I have chronic pain conditions and it would never occur to me to go to the ER for simple pain relief. My PCP and I have a plan for when my pain gets worse, and she lets me keep certain pain meds at home for those occasions. I use the meds we decided upon, and call her office immediately. Her office fits me in as soon as possible, usually within a few days. I feel your doctor is being lazy by not looking after you himself, and telling you to go to the ER when you have pain. Just my opinion. My doc and my husband<APO>s doc both keep a couple of slots open every day for emergencies such as this. If they don<APO>t get any calls for emergency appts. then they use that time with other scheduled patients or to complete paper work, or God forbid go home early or take a longer lunch!!! Docs who book their appts. so tightly that they can never get an urgent patient in really aren<APO>t doing their patients any favors. Take care, Annette""Ask your pcp for a referral to a PM doctor. Don<APO>t take 6 tylenol at one time, it can kill your liver. You should follow the directions on the bottle exactly, never take any more than recommended in a single dose or go over the maximum daily dose. I am sorry, I don<APO>t remember why you are having such a hard time finding a PM doctor, what happened with your old one? Take care, Annette""Some people find the patches last 72 hours as they are designed to, and others find it works better to change them at 48 hours and do so with their doctors approval. As far as adding a patch and keeping the old one on for a couple of days, I would not do that unless your doctor tells you it is okay. You can ask him when you see him, or call and ask him or your pharmacist. The instructions you got with your patches should also have this kind of information in them. Read them and see what they say. Never base what you do with meds on what someone tells you on an internet message board. It is fine to get ideas from one, and then discuss it with your doctor. I am glad to hear the patch is working for you at this point. That is great news. Take care, Annette""Hi, Mark Since the 25 mcg/hr patch makes you feel ""normal"", why go up another 12.5 mcg/hr with a second patch? Don<APO>t get in the habit of trying to chase the pain free state, it is not reasonable. Folks with chronic pain will always have some pain, and by increasing the dose looking for ""pain-free"" we end up with huge doses of drugs, and the pain always seeps through anyway. I suspect most of us have incurable pain and will be dealing with it for the rest of our lives. I try my best to keep my med doses as low as possible for as long as possible. You might try adding other kinds of meds rather than increasing the fentanyl, just for when you have extra pain. You can discuss this with your doctor. There are many kinds of BT meds available, including ones that are absorbed inside your mouth rather than in your stomach. Glad you found a good doctor. Take care, Annette""Although my doctor has always been willing to increase my long acting med by 100% when I needed an increase, I have decided to only increase it by 50% of my total daily dose. I have found this works fine. I don<APO>t see any reason to increase the dose any higher than absolutely necessary. I will probably be on long acting opiates for the rest of my life, I like keeping my dose as low as possible so I have plenty of room to increase it when I need to. I don<APO>t want doctors freaking out because I am on ""too high a dose"" for them to be comfortable any sooner than necessary. Take care, Annette""It is correct medical practice to use about 50% of the equianalgesic dose when switching to a new opiate as the starting dose. This is because there is only a partial cross tolerance between opiates. If the patient has increased pain or what seem like withdrawal symptoms, she should be given breakthrough meds by the doctor to use as he adjusts the dose of the patch upwards slowly until she is doing well. There are also guidelines for patients to use when starting on the fentanyl patch when they are only on short acting opiates and have never used long acting opiates of any kind. I am sorry you have had such a terrible experience with doctors in regard to your pain meds. I have been very fortunate in having had great doctors. I ran into one ER doctor about 25 years ago when I went in with a migraine while visiting someone out of town. He was really rude, his ER nurse apologized for his behavior. He did give me an injection that worked just fine though. I wasn<APO>t on any opiates at that time. I marked it up to he was having a bad night. Addicts and drug dealers are happy to go through the degradation and intimidation to get meds. I find that very sad. Vent anytime, and feel free to ignore my posts if you want to. I speak out very frankly, but as accurately as I can. Not everyone likes that. Take care, Annette""If it is not red, or hot to touch, I would move past the cellulitis and on to other possible diagnoses. You have had the doppler study to rule out clots, that is the most dangerous diagnosis, so your doctor was right to rule that one out immediately. Now you have had the antibiotics, so unless it was just the wrong antibiotic, that is probably not the problem. If your blood work is all normal, your kidneys and liver are probably working fine, as most doctors include a chem panel when doing blood tests for swelling. Have you told your doctor that your tummy is bloated, and you feel like you aren<APO>t emptying your bladder completely? Your bladder is at the very front of your abdomen, it is easy for the doctor to feel it with her hands during a physical exam. The other test for urinary retention is to ask you to go empty your bladder as much as you can, then the nurse inserts a catheter into your bladder and removes any urine that was left behind, and measures it. The doctor can tell by how much urine is left if you are retaining urine. It is normal to have some urine left, it is a matter of how much. I would go back to see the doctor again, give her as clear an idea as possible as to what is going on. Making a medical diagnosis is a process, the doctor makes a list in her head of all the possible things that would fit your symptoms, and then starts working through the list starting with the most dangerous things and the most common things. (Cellulitis is very common and occurs for no apparent reason.) Don<APO>t feel bad if it takes awhile to figure this one out. Take care, Annette""""Lap"" surgery is surgery into the abdomen as in a ""laparoscopy"" or a ""laparotomy"". I am sure you mean he had an ""arthroscope"" type surgery as opposed to an open procedure. In this type of surgery the surgery is done through a scope that is inserted into the joint. You would have several small incisions as opposed to a large incision with an open procedure. Glad to hear your husband is doing well and has recovered completely. Take care, Annette""I would discuss this with a pharmacist who is well informed about these things. Opiates are not the best drugs for migraines anyway, can you take any of the migraine rescue drugs? I had terrible migraines four to five times a week at the worst. I stopped using opiates completely, and relied on other types of meds and found they really worked better. Opiates can cause rebound headaches if you take them more than 2-3 days per week. I was always glad I didn<APO>t develop those. Take care, Annette""I have also known doctors who did lumbar spinal surgery using the anterior approach. It always grossed me out to know they just pushed all the intestines to one side to get to the spine from the front. Take care, Annette""Sorry, Caprice. I did the survey, not sure why I bothered. Please do not ""craft better tools"". Just fix the email digests, which have not worked properly for over two years now. If our voices were so important, this would have been corrected a long time ago. I (and others) have posted about this on the Tech. Board repeatedly, I am always told they are working on it. I know you are not the person who can actually make this happen. I apologize to you as you are just the poor person who gets stuck reading these kinds of complaints and passing them on. Take care, Annette""I have never taken this drug myself. I have given it to patients for pain many years ago as a nurse. It was indicated for moderate to severe pain. I didn<APO>t find that it worked that well for my patients, most doctors soon went back to using other opiates. I am not familiar with using it for chronic pain, I will have to do some reading. Because it is an opiate antagonist my drug handbook carries a warning about using it if you have a history of opiate dependence as it may trigger withdrawal symptoms. Is your doctor suggesting that you go off the MS for long enough to clean it out of your system, or is he advising you to take the Talwin NX along with the morphine? I would question taking it along with morphine as a regular med, I would need the full explanation of how it works and I would need to see the research. I will go look this up and do some reading. Take care, Annette""I Googled this and did not find any recent research using this drug for chronic pain. I would ask the doctor for links to the research or copies of it if he has them available. The drug handbook info says one may become dependent on Talwin NX is one takes it for awhile. Take care, Annette""Talwin NX also contains naloxone, the other opioids do not contain that, even methadone. Naloxone may trigger withdrawals if this drug is taken by someone on opiates. Including this in the drug<APO>s formula was done to prevent drug abusers from crushing the tablets and dissolving them to inject the drug. The plasma half life of Talwin NX is 2-3 hours per my drug handbook. Oral dosing for pain is every 3-4 hours. Methadone<APO>s half life is 8-59 hours per the same book. Dosing for pain is every 4-12 hours, usually less frequently after one is established on this medication because of the long half life. Take care, Annette""You should have received better pain control while you were in the hospital. 5 mgs. of morphine IV is a common dose for opiate naive patients, you should have gotten much more if you were already dependent on opiates. I have given patients in severe pain up to 10 mg. IV, even if they were not on opiates at home. We would just titrate the dose according to what the patient needed and could tolerate. My friend was in the hospital and had surgery last year. He was already on methadone and percocet for pain. They let him have a patient controlled pump the day after surgery so he could control his own meds. As soon as he was able to swallow they gave him back the meds he was used to, plus extra Percocet if he needed it for acute post op pain. Usually that is all you need to do, take your regular meds, plus a bit more of your breakthrough meds for any extra pain you are having. To me it is scary that there are still doctors and hospitals that do not know how to handle people on chronic pain meds when they go to the hospital and have acute pain. I am so sorry you went through this. Take care, Annette""I understand the tests you need done and why. I am a bit confused about the note saying you can<APO>t work until after you have the tests and appts. with your doctors? But, you are already off of work? It would seem like you either cannot work due to the pain, or you can work with it. I wouldn<APO>t mention the appts. or tests on the note. I have had the EMG or nerve test, it is not a big deal, so don<APO>t worry about it too much. I am sure Charles will chime in with the stats on spinal surgery for pain vs. spinal surgery for functional deficits. My neurosurgeon would never do spinal disc surgery for pain alone, he felt the odds were poor and did not outweigh the risks. I had a C6-7 discectomy for functional deficits, my hand was not working well and losing function fast. It did work for that. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette"."The note should just say you cannot return to work due to pain or whatever symptoms you have, and a possible return date if they require that. I just meant not to have the pcp write the note to say you cannot go back to work until you have certain tests and appts. completed. Work may or may not accept that as a reasonable excuse. Management can be nice or mean, you never know, lol. I liked my neurosurgeon, I pretty much knew I would be having surgery by the time I went to see him, because I was losing function in my hand. He did a basic exam and looked at the MRI films I took with me, then made his recommendations. If this guy that you are going to see recommends surgery, be sure to get a second opinion before proceeding. You should do that with all elective surgery. Take care, Annette""I just had the plain discectomy, the two vertebrae fused naturally after 4-5 months. Every one is different, so you need to speak to a good neurosurgeon and then if you consider surgery, get a second opinion. I do not recommend surgery if you are seeking pain relief. The risks are greater than the possible benefits as far as I am concerned. God helps those who help themselves. Take care, Annette""I take 100 mg. when I wake up along with my long lasting morphine. It seems to make my meds last longer during the day. I take less hydrocodone/APAP. I have tried omitting it, but I notice the difference right away. I don<APO>t take it later in the day, because then I don<APO>t sleep at night. Tramadol is one of the meds my doc told me to try and see how it worked out for me. It is just one of those things that works fine for some people, and doesn<APO>t for others. Take care, Annette""I totally agree with you. I have had a number of days lately where I have not taken any of my breakthrough meds except my ultram once a day when I get up. But I notice right away if I don<APO>t take it at all. It really helps make my long acting drug work better. I only take that two times a day now. I can<APO>t take the Ultram later in the day though, because it makes it too hard for me to sleep. I think Ultram is one of the many tools we have for our chronic pain, and it is worth trying if you have never tried it before. Sure, some people will have a bad side effect with it, and they should opt for other meds, but many people will find it works well. It is approved for mild to moderate pain, I would compare it to taking one vicodin with 5 mg. of hydrocodone in it for me. Other people will have other efficacy. Take care, Annette""if you were taking pain meds for pain and became dependent on them, that is different than being addicted to them. If you were taking pain meds, but ended up taking them to get high rather than for pain, then you are probably an addict. Suboxone is an opiate antagonist, but it also causes dependence, and if you stopped taking it abruptly you may well go through withdrawal symptoms. It is considered a narcotic. I would not consider you addicted to suboxone, because you are not taking it to get high, you are taking it to function better in life. I would say you are dependent on suboxone. I consider it pretty much the same as using methadone for opioid dependence. Yes, you are still taking a drug every day, but so what? You are moving towards being drug free, and I consider that a good thing. I used to work in drug abuse treatment and I say congratulations on moving forward in your recovery. I think it is something to be proud of, not ashamed of. Anyone can become an addict, not everyone can get into the recovery stage. When you are good and ready, you can take the next step and taper off of the suboxone. But don<APO>t do it until you are ready, the heck with what anyone else thinks. Hugs, Annette""I would get a referral to a pain management doc, and see for sure if medicaid will pay for it. Otherwise your pcp can manage your pain meds as long as you are taking a reasonable amount of them. Tell your pcp that if medicaid won<APO>t pay for PM then you would like him to continue to take care of you. I would pass on a myelogram or any invasive diagnostic test myself, unless I was already planning on having surgery, but that is just my opinion. I do not know if you are still taking a friend<APO>s pain pills or not, but that is a bad idea. If you are currently dependent on opiates that you are getting from ""friends"" and have not told your doctor, I don<APO>t have any advice that will really help you. Take care, Annette""No one here can diagnose your headaches. You need to see a doctor and get a proper evaluation to figure out what is causing them. Take care, Annette""Did your OB prescribe the amoxicillin or did your pcp? If you have already seen your pcp and she prescribed these meds you are currently on, then you need to call her back and make an appt. to see her again. If you have not seen your pcp yet, get to it. If you get short of breath from even just talking and you ""have basically been on the couch motionless for the 2 weeks"" you clearly should NOT drive a car, if your doctor cannot see you, perhaps you have someone take you to the ER. Take care, Annette""I am so sorry to hear about your sister<APO>s addiction. I know how difficult that can be for a family. I do know that you can stop enabling her addictive behavior without cutting off all communication with her. You might discuss this with your therapist. You might get more cooperation from your family if you approach it from a medical disease mode. Take care, Annette""My first job as a nurse was in an addiction treatment center that I helped found. There is nothing you can do to help your sister get straight and sober. She has to decide that is the path she wants to follow. All you can do is not enable her addiction by rescuing her, giving her money, etc. It is your choice if you feel she is too toxic to you to want to keep her in your life. I have family members with addiction problems, my choice has been to maintain contact with them so if they ever get straight they will know I am in their corner for them. I refuse to participate in their dramas though. Staying in some contact with her would also allow you contact with her children if they are still minors. Don<APO>t abandon them if there is any way to avoid that. I wish there was some magic answer that cured addiction, but there isn<APO>t one. I personally feel it is a much more difficult road to walk than chronic pain for both the patient and the family. Take care, Annette""Write down your questions prior to your appt. and take them with you. Take a pad and paper so you can write down the answers as you go along. Many people forget the answers to their questions as soon as they get out of the office. It is just nerves that makes people forget. Take care, Annette""No it is not a new med. I can<APO>t remember how long it has been available, but it has been years. Take care, Annette""All hydrocodone pill formulas are immediate release in the US. Hydrocodone does not come in a pill by itself (in the US), it is available with acetaminophen, aspirin, or ibuprofen. I think you can have it made up by a compounding pharmacy, if you want it alone. I believe that then it is a schedule II drug rather than a schedule III. Oxycodone is available in immediate release or long acting form. Take care, Annette""I personally don<APO>t believe there is much clinical difference between one opiate and another. It is all in the dosing as far as I am concerned. If you have used oxycodone before and it worked for you, it would make sense to try it again. It comes in short acting and long acting forms. I would suggest you try a long acting opiate for use on a set schedule, then add a short acting opiate as a breakthrough med. You end up taking fewer pills and your blood levels are more stable. You can call your insurance company and they should be able to tell you what is on their formulary and what would be the cheapest. Usually generics are cheaper than non-generics. Methadone is usually the cheapest of all. Dosing it is a little trickier, you need to start very low and increase the dose slowly until you hit the dose that works for you. It is long acting so often you only need to take it twice a day on a set schedule. Take care, Annette""I would go see the doctor your pcp is referring you to. Either pay for it yourself, or put it on your regular health insurance. Get an opinion from someone who has no financial interest in what you may or may not do next. The w/c doctors answer to w/c, they get more referrals from them if they find enough of them ready to go back to work. Do you have a copy of the form you filled out for the doctor who said you ""have no pain""? If that is what you actually said, then he is correct in his thinking you should go back to work. If you were careful in your documentation of your pain on this form, it should back you up. I would also suggest you hire a lawyer in the state where the w/c case has been filed. Many doctors insist that their medical assistants or nurses make ALL patients undress and put on a gown, regardless of what is wrong with them. This makes things move faster (for the doctor) if he decides you need further examination. Although I am a nurse, I have never heard of a nurse getting w/c for DDD of the spine because unless you had a specific injury, it is difficult to prove it is due to work. Some places they have a no lifting policy and use mechanical hoists and lift teams to move patients from bed to chairs, etc. It seems like it is only recently that the public has been aware at all of the difficult physical work involved in being a nurse. Take care, Annette""I never had any trouble with w/c doctors until my husband fell off a truck onto concrete and developed a non-healing wound and AVN of the hip he landed on. They treated the wound until it finally healed after two years of wound care and two surgeries. But they claimed the hip problem was re-existing and refused to cover the hip replacement he required. All of his own doctors said the hip injury from the fall caused the AVN, but the w/c doctors all said it was pre-existing. He had NEVER had pain or any problems with that hip prior to the accident. The definition of pre-existing in our state says you must have medical documentation that it had been diagnosed and treated in the past. They opted to ignore that. It is the job of ""independent"" doctors who work for w/c to reject as many claims as they can. We gave up and used his employers insurance and paid out nearly $5,000 for our share of the cost, not counting time off work, etc. He had his hip replaced and is doing great. It is been one year post op now. This is one more reason I am for a single payer system of universal health care. We would eliminate w/c because all people would go through their own doctors for care and they would be paid out of one system. It has made me politically more radical than I was before. Take care, Annette""I live in a state where there are laws on the books to protect medical marijuana users. They have to get a doctor to fill out a form and they pay a yearly fee, they then get a card from the state. As long as they do that, the state and local police will leave them alone. Of course, nothing protects them from the feds. I tried it years ago when we first moved here, both of my doctors at that time said it was okay in moderation if it worked. For me, it did not work at all, so I never bothered to apply for the card. I feel the same way about marijuana that I do about other pain management drugs. I feel it you are more functional on it than you are off of it, it is okay to use it in moderation. If all one did was lay around stoned all the time, I would not consider that more functional. You also have to consider your own body<APO>s toleration of smoking daily. As I see it, you have several options: keep it on the down low and live in fear of getting caught, work towards getting it legalized, or move elsewhere where there are at least local laws to protect you. You also need to decide whether or not to discuss this with your doctors as marijuana can interact with other drugs. You can feel them out first and see what their views are before actually telling them you are already using it. The last suggestion I have is to ask your doctors about prescribing Marinol for you. It is a pill that contains THC, the main ingredient of marijuana. If this works for you, it eliminates the illegal aspects of smoking pot, and the possible harm to your lungs of smoking it. Take care, Annette""I assume the CT was of his head? If so that was the appropriate thing to do based on what I have learned over the years as an ER nurse. Two weeks is not long enough for him to give up yet. Many of the headache meds designed to prevent headaches take up to 4-6 weeks to work. Your hubby also need rescue meds to take when the headaches hit. I had a bump on the head in an auto accident once and had chronic daily headaches for about 8 weeks, then they went away. My doc called it post-concussive syndrome. It was miserable while I had it, and I was happy to see the end of it. Take care, Annette""Nope, I have a thick skin and take nothing personally. I can<APO>t remember anything anyone has said lately that would bother me. I was gone for a couple of days, my brother came through town on his way to his son<APO>s community college graduation. In prison, unfortunately. But, he is the first one there to complete this program and graduate. I am very proud of him for doing this. Not for what he did to get there, but once there it was his choice what path to take, and he has not been in trouble once. For that I am forever grateful. Anyhow, I am back for now. I don<APO>t post every day, and usually only late in the night when I do, so don<APO>t worry. My brother will be coming home Monday and staying here for a day or so, so I might not be on line then either. I use the email digests, but if I missed a post, I apologize, please just post again, preferably with my name in the heading, so I don<APO>t miss it. If someone else posts and says what I would have anyway, I usually don<APO>t post. I have my own pain levels and at a certain point, I just give up and go get more comfy than I am at my desk. Take care, Annette""Thanks for answering Lori. Nothing anyone says on line upsets me much. The email digests do not do what they say they will as far as delivering on time, but they do usually arrive at least one time per day. I only answer late at night, so I don<APO>t pay any attention to what time they do arrive. I have given up on WebMD fixing them, lol. Hope you are feeling well. Hugs, Annette""I wouldn<APO>t wish my doctor to be in pain, lol. I used to work with an ER doc who was wonderful to pain patients when they came in. Then he developed back pain of his own, and finally ended up having back surgery. He never took anything stronger than NSAIDs when he had to work. He had the pain we have, and he continued to work, and he actually had less sympathy for folks in pain after his own experience. He still provided great care, because he was a great doctor. However, he told me privately that if he could still manage to go to work with all his pain, so could some of his patients. He shared with me that he had lost a certain amount of respect for many of our patients since he had his own experience with chronic pain. We worked in a small town hospital and had long term relationships with many of our patients. Many of them used the ER like it was a clinic, even at night. Since then, I am careful what I wish for, lol. Take care, Annette""I just want everyone to know there is hope out there, there are good doctors around. My pcp manages my pain, and between the two of us we have done pretty well for the last 11 years or so. I had seen a PM doc just before I moved here so it had been awhile since I had been to one. She was updating her files and decided that all her pain patients should sign up to date opiate consents and pain med contracts. Part of that was that we needed to see a board certified pain specialist for a consultation if we had not seen one recently. My state medical board has guidelines for doctors who manage chronic pain with opiates, and they include a consultation with another doctor, and his agreement that opiates are the right way to go. As long as the doctors practice within these guidelines they are fine with the authorities. I asked my doctor for a referral to a PM doctor and she gave me one in my town. I checked out his website and he practices interventional pain management. I was very concerned that he would have an immediate bias towards doing injections and procedures and against using oral pain meds. I was so wrong to worry. He did a very thorough history, both the written one I filled out, and the one he did in our interview. We went through all the treatments and meds I had tried over the years, and I had tried more than he was used to. I have FMS, migraines, and DDD. I have had one discectomy in 1992. We spent about 50 minutes talking (he was even on time for my appt.). After our talk he told me I was possibly the best managed chronic pain patient he had ever seen, he congratulated me and my pcp. The only suggestion he made was that I do my stretches twice a day rather than once a day. Otherwise, I should just keep on with the treatment plan I had in place. He did not even suggest I have any invasive procedures. He commented on leaving that in his experience folks with FMS ended up in acute pain after the tender point exam and it was best done only to make a diagnosis. He felt there was no need to repeat it after that unless there was some kind of change in the patient<APO>s condition. He said since he would not be there to treat that pain, he would rather not instigate it. Hooray!! A caring doctor who understands FMS pain and does not want to make it worse. Seeing him was a really nice experience. So, they are out there. Keep looking if you have not found one yet. Take care, Annette""I am sorry you are in so much pain. I hope you find some way to get relief soon. There is no patient bill of rights that says a doctor has to treat pain with opiate pain meds. What kind of meds or other treatments a doctor offers is entirely up to him. I don<APO>t know what treatments would be best for you, that is between you and your doctor. I would suggest you choose one doctor and stick with him. Try whatever he offers, and if it doesn<APO>t work, tell him so. Then try the next thing he offers. As you build up a relationship with him he may learn to trust you enough to offer opiates if he feels they are warranted. Take care, Annette""Great advice!!! Hope you are doing okay yourself??? Hugs, Annette""I totally agree with you about the small percentage of people who may develop addiction after using opiates, and that education is necessary for both the general population and our doctors so that people are given this option if they have pain. That said, it is not only folks who have a personal or family history of addiction that become addicts. Some people who have no history of addiction in themselves or their families become addicts. It may be that they were in a very vulnerable place in their life when they were introduced to opiates for their physical pain, and they ended up using them for the wrong reasons. Because I have worked with addicts, and know how very serious addiction can be I believe that this should be one of the possible side effects that patients should be educated about. Not to scare them, but to inform them. Just like surgeons should always warn patients that infection is a risk of any incision through the skin. The surgeon that did my husband<APO>s hip replacement has a less than 4% infection rate, but he still told us about that possible risk. Not to talk us out of having the surgery, but so we would be careful and watchful after the surgery. Same thing with addiction. It is rare, but it does happen, and an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Take care, Annette""Gail and I totally agree that using opiates for chronic pain is appropriate in most cases. I just believe in education about ALL possible side effects from meds to prevent problems, not to scare people away. She and I both use opiates for chronic pain, and have for quite awhile. I have used them daily for over twelve years. I believe in open, honest communication between doctors and patients. Take care, Annette""I am an RN also, although I am disabled and not currently working. Everyone has their own opinion about using opiates for chronic pain. I feel it is fine and as long as I function better with them than without them, I will continue to use them. I don<APO>t find it necessary to tell everyone in my life about what kinds of meds I take. No one treats me like an addict. There are pain management clinics that aim to eliminate the use of opiates in all their patients. There are other pain management clinics that do not. I certainly recommend the latter. I think you should do anything you can to lower your pain levels, including using opiates. If you truly feel that you want to be off all the opiates, then work with your doctor on a tapering program. My husband had his hip replaced, and had less pain so he wanted to taper off of the methadone he had been on. We discussed it with his doctor and he tapered off with no withdrawal symptoms at all. He had stopped taking morphine years ago when he had cancer and he says he had no withdrawal symptoms then that was worse than a case of the flu, and it only lasted a few days. Everyone is different of course. Your doctor should be able to guide you through this. You can go one step lower on the patch, then switch over to an oral opiate for the end of the taper. If you feel that your pain becomes unmanagable at any point, you can always change your mind about stopping the opiates. Good luck. Take care, Annette""I totally agree with Gail. The research I have read in nursing journals says that up to 5% of people who take opiates as directed for pain will become addicted to the meds. It is a psychological condition, but it is also based on neurological changes that happen in the brain when one takes these kinds of drugs. There may also be a genetic predisposition in some people. Folks with their own medical history of drug abuse or a family history of drug abuse are often more likely to develop addiction themselves. That said, even folk with NO history of addiction can become addicts. Can recovering addicts be treated for pain with opiates successfully? Yes, with careful monitoring by both a pain management professional and an addictions specialist, some can use opiates successfully. I worked with opiate addicted people for my first job in nursing back in the 1970s. I am so glad I did. I NEVER take a pain pill without asking myself first if I really need it for physical pain, or am I taking it for a bit of an escape from life. I only take them for pain. Very few people with addictions are treated successfully, it is a horrible disease with far-reaching ramifications that reach through the friends and family of the addict in addition to the direct affect on the addict. Even if only 1% of opiate users became addicted, it would still be something we should all be aware of due to the seriousness of addiction. I never push the use of opiates on anyone, if they feel they are using their pain meds inappropriately, I believe them. The best person one can speak to regarding pain management vs. addiction is a trusted health care professional who is familiar with that person and their medical history. Thank you Gail, for bringing this topic to our attention and starting a discussion about it. Take care, Annette""It sounds like irritable bowel syndrome to me except for the 35 pound weight loss. Many meds can cause abdominal problems including constipation. You should see a gastroenterologist and be evaluated. A weight loss like that can mean something bad is wrong with you like cancer. Take care, Annette""Any time you get a headache that is different than usual, you need to see a doctor and be evaluated. There are free/low cost clinics in many communities, you can ""Google"", free clinics in<UD><UD><UD><UD><UD><UD><UD>(your area) and often find one that way. You can also call Goodwill, Salvation Army, or Catholic Charities and ask them. Also your county health department might be able to help you. Take care, Annette""No more apologies. Things are fine with you and me. Even some bad things can have good outcomes. I am proud of my nephew. My brother gets in tomorrow night, so I will hear all about graduation. Take care, Annette""I wish there were a simple answer but there isn<APO>t. I would stick with one doctor who specializes in headache management, probably a neurologist. Then you just have to go through all the different meds, first one at a time, then in pairs. It can take 2-3 years to do this as you need to stay on a steady dose of each for 3-4 weeks at least to see if they will work. Narcotics are a poor choice for migraines or other types of headaches, as they can cause rebound headaches, which can lead to chronic daily headaches. Include the day your period starts and ends in your headache journal. It took me a really long time to learn to manage my migraines, but it was worth it when I finally came up with a treatment program that worked fairly well. Take care, Annette""Please see a pain management specialist before you opt for another surgery. There are lots of treatments and other meds to try first. Take care, Annette""Dystonia is a symptom, not a diagnosis. It is an impairment of muscle tone, and is often a side effect of meds according to my medical text. You are only taking one or two percocets a day, that is not a lot. What other meds/treatments have you tried? Why do you think your doctor is wrong about the FMS diagnosis, and you are correct about the dystonia one? Did he do the FMS tender point test? Take care, Annette""Just the fact of using opiates does not mean one WILL become addicted. Less than 5% of people who use opiates as directed for chronic pain become addicts. Take care, Annette""Only your doctor can make a medical diagnosis. I have FMS, 99% of my pain is centered around my hips and legs, with some pain in the upper body around the spine for the most part. I occasionally have pain in my upper arms. FMS pain can be anywhere on the body. A tender point test is quick and easy to do during an office visit, it only takes a few minutes. The FMS diagnosis is based on at least three months of pain above and below the waist, and on both sides of the mid-line of the body, a positive tender point test, and a lack of any other illness that would explain the symptoms. Most doctors do a variety of blood tests to rule out any other cause of the pain and fatigue. Everyone with FMS has a different experience, everyone with it has pain, fatigue is the second complaint. Many people have other problems along with it, some don<APO>t. I recommend www.myalgia.com for good medical info about FMS. Whatever the cause of your pain, you can still be treating it. There are other meds to try, and non-drug treatments also. There are other anti-seizure meds, and antidepressant meds that are useful for chronic pain. Take care, Annette""Teresa said many useful things. I want to really impress upon you the comment she made about ""chasing your tail"" with taking the pain meds after work and then waiting for them to get your pain levels down to something you can deal with. It has been shown in medical studies that people who take opiates when their pain level starts to go up, rather than waiting until the pain is terrible to take their pills, end up taking less medicine in the long run. Opiates work better when taken early on in the pain cycle. You should discuss with your doctor trying a long acting opiate, whether you try the fentanyl patch or one of the long acting pills doesn<APO>t really matter to me. By doing that you end up with a steadier level of medicine in your blood stream, and a steadier amount of pain relief. Many people also take a short acting med like your percocet for any breakthrough pain caused by increased activity, etc. Addiction happens in less than 5% of those who use opiates for pain. Be aware of this, but it is no reason to avoid opiates if you have no history of addiction problems in the past. Take care, Annette""If you don<APO>t tell anyone about your meds, then they won<APO>t treat you like a drug addict. Very few people know what meds I take, and for quite awhile it was only my doctor, my pharmacist, and my husband. As far as the money goes, that is tougher. There are some clinics that are free or low cost on a sliding scale depending on income, but you have to hunt them down. Try calling Goodwill, the Salvation Army, Catholic Charities, or your local health dept. You might also ask your doctor if he would be willing to lower his fee for now, or barter for skills that you may have. All he can do is say no, can<APO>t hurt to ask. Take care, Annette""This is a question for your pharmacist. Take care, Annette""I guess if I have to ask, it isn<APO>t me you are thinking of. Take care, Annette.""If this is due to a work injury, call your w/c caseworker and ask her what to do next. If you have a w/c lawyer you might discuss this with him. I went to my state dept. of disability and vocational rehabilitation when I saw I was not going to be able to keep working in my job. All I needed was a letter to that effect from my doctor. They offered retraining and education paid for by the state, and then helped me get a job. I worked for another 5-6 months in home health with no lifting included in what I told them I could do before I was hired. They had plenty of work for me. Take care, Annette""Substituting one opiate for another often reduces or eliminates withdrawal. If you develop any withdrawal symptoms, call your doctor and he can adjust the fentanyl or let you take percocet for breakthrough while you adjust to the patch. Take care, Annette""I believe that this is a drug that needs to be carefully prescribed by a doctor with experience. I worked in a heroin treatment facility in the 1970s that used methadone as one treatment method for heroin addiction. We didn<APO>t have any deaths in our client base in the years that I worked there. I am aware that in higher doses it can cause electrical irregularities in the heart that can cause death. It should NEVER be mixed with alcohol or benzos in my opinion. Those mix badly and can cause severe respiratory depression and death. But, this is something I learned nearly 40 years ago. I find people on these boards and others who routinely mix methadone and benzos with their doctor<APO>s blessing. I feel the doctors are to blame, not the drug itself. This is why I believe that it should be prescribed by doctors experienced in its use. Doctor<APO>s education is important here. I am a nurse, and a recent pain management class that I attended said one should not prescribe any opiates and benzos at the same time due to the risks involved in the interaction of these drugs. I think this is particularly important with methadone. One must start the methadone dose very low and increase it very slowly. Once you get to a dose that works, one can often decrease the dose somewhat and still get good pain relief. This is due to the extremely long half-life of the drug. Patients must absolutely stick to the dose the doctor gives them. NO EXTRA PILLS, ever. Methadone works differently than oxycodone or morphine, you can<APO>t double up on them when you feel like you need a bit of extra pain relief, or back down one day because you feel better, then increase them again the next day. You can die that way. I think this is a very useful drug in the right hands, prescribed by the right doctors. Take care, Annette""Benzos are drugs in the benzodiazepine family, things like valium, xanax, ativan, klonopin, restoril, etc. We were told way back then not to ever mix them with methadone when I worked in heroin addiction treatment in the 1970s. It seems like now they are finally telling the pain management world that it is still a bad idea. They mentioned it at a pain management class I took a year or so ago, and when I mentioned that here a lot of people got angry with me and thought I was wrong. Apparently they were taking opiates and benzos and didn<APO>t like me suggesting it wasn<APO>t a good idea. Take care, Annette""Any time I can help I am happy to, Charlie. Methadone was invented by the Germans during WWII because they could not get enough morphine for their troops. It was used for pain only until the 1960s or so, then it was utilized for heroin addiction. I was in nursing school in 1968 and was familiar with it mixed in a cocktail they gave cancer patients for pain. After I graduated in 1970, I worked in a heroin addiction clinic where we used it for treatment for those who wanted to try it. It was still considered experimental for that use at that time. I feel so comfortable with methadone that when my husband needed pain management for a bad hip, I had no trouble with his doctor putting him on methadone. He was on it for a couple of years until his other medical problem was healed and he could have the hip replacement surgery he needed. He was maintained on the methadone until after the surgery, then his doctor told us he could taper off whenever he wanted to. I fill his weekly medicine box with his meds, and my husband left it up to me to taper him off. He told me he didn<APO>t want to know about it. I told him fine, but he was to tell me if he felt sick at all. I tapered him off, he says he had no withdrawals at all. When I went on long acting meds my doctor and I were new to each other so I opted to go on long acting morphine because that was what she felt comfortable with. If we ever lose our private insurance, I will end up on Medicare and will switch to methadone. I hope it is working well for you. Take care, Annette""Will these new changes make any difference with the email digests? Like make them work correctly, lol? Please don<APO>t tell me you are getting rid of them entirely, once a day is better than never. Hugs, Annette""I hope they work. If I have to go back to using the boards themselves, I will probably not bother. It is a pain in the butt, and takes much more time than just scanning the digests we have now. I really like the community here, but every time WebMD has changed things for the better, it seems like the boards became more difficult and time consuming to use. The email digests are the only thing that have kept me here this long. When will these ""changes for the better"" take place? I do appreciate you finding the correct answer for me, instead of just rattling something off the top of your head. Take care, Annette"."According to my lab manual an adult male should have a red blood cell count of 4.5-5.5 and a female should have one of 4.0-5.0. Platelets should be 150-400. I would not worry about the red blood cells as much as the low platelets. There are many different things that can cause changes in the cell counts and platelet counts. Just being sick can explain the low red blood cells, if you get dehydrated from vomiting or just not eating/drinking enough, you lose blood volume and the red cell count goes up. When you are sick it is often difficult to get a good blood sample, throw in the skill or lack of it of the person drawing the blood, and it can be a real hassle. You need to talk to your doctor and ask him to explain the blood test results to you in the context of your medical history and present condition. Take care, Annette""Ditto what Teresa said. All doctors have their own way of doing things. I would be prepared to give a specimen every time you go see him. Drink some extra fluids, but don<APO>t go overboard with that. If your urine is too diluted they may think you are trying to beat the test. The reason for the test is twofold, to make sure you are taking what is given to you rather than selling it, and to make sure you are NOT taking anything not prescribed to you. Take care and good luck with the new doc. Annette""I would personally recommend an increase in the long acting med, Oxycontin, rather than the break through med. The literature I have read says one should only be using BT meds a couple of times a day, and if you need it more often than that, you should increase your long acting med. My personal experience is that over ten years I have only increased my breakthrough meds by 1/2 a Norco per dose. I started out taking one, now I take 1 1/2 per dose. As long as my long acting med dose is correct, the BT med gets my blood levels of opiates high enough to work when I need it. All doctors have their own way of prescribing opiates, and there is no ""one"" way to do it. I would just work within his comfort zone and be trustworthy. As long as you maintain a good relationship with your doctor, you should be able to experiment with your meds (with his permission of course) until you get the doses right. Take care, Annette""It is normal to leave clips in place when you have certain kinds of surgery. Go back and talk to your regular doctor and see what he says. Perhaps he can refer you to another pain management doc that is kinder. Take care, Annette""Just tell your doctor what is going on and he will suggest something for you. He knows you better than any of us do. All doctors have their own way of doing things, and I feel it is best not to go in with preconceived notions or to give him names of particular drugs. Take care, Annette""I doubt there is any actiq available at a reasonable cost anywhere, the drug company is in it to make lots of $$$. Insurance companies are also in it to make $$$, thus the conflict. Just ask your doctor to prescribe something your insurance company does cover. Fentanyl is the only drug that is available that is absorbed into the mucosal membrane of the mouth. You will probably have to settle for a pill that you swallow and is absorbed in the gut. It will take a bit longer to work, but there are many drugs available for BT pain. You have the some of the same pain conditions that I do, you should be able to find something that works for you. Take care, Annette""Call the company that makes your actiq and ask to speak to their consumer assistance program. Many drug companies do have programs to help folks who take their own drugs. You may have to do a lot of paper work and have your doctor or pharmacist sign off on it. Take care, Annette""The swelling is probably due to something else, go see your doctor and have it evaluated. Take care, Annette""Don<APO>t go to a surgeon expecting pain management, they are not trained in treating chronic pain. See a pain management specialist or your own pcp. My pcp manages my chronic pain. All you need a surgeon for is to tell you if any surgical procedure will help you. Always get a second opinion from another surgeon before committing to a surgery. I would get the MRI done, then seek other opinions as you wish. Take care, Annette""If you and your doctor have decided that you can take three pain pills a day, then take them as you need them, don<APO>t wait until the pain is terrible or they won<APO>t work. I am not sure that the distraction from being in terrible pain isn<APO>t more likely to cause mistakes than being on medicine to relieve the pain. I would not increase my dose on a work day, but if you are on a steady dose and are very careful with your work, it should not be a problem. I wouldn<APO>t mind doing business with someone who using pain meds appropriately. We use a firm mattress, and a 4 inch 5.5 density memory foam topper with a heated mattress pad on top. I find it works as well as anything does. I still get a lot of hip pain when I lay on my side, and use Lidoderm patches for that, one on each hip. I have been coming here since before it was Web MD, it was a different name back then, Sapient Health Network I think. I think it was about 12 years ago. I never used the chat rooms, just the message boards. Even on the message boards there are cliques at times. Although I don<APO>t find that to be true here, I have found it true on some of the other message boards here at Web MD. I just stick around, and lurk during treacherous times, and come out again after the dust settles. I have been here as long as most people have, and longer than most of the trouble makers. I think for the most part this is a good place to come and share and get answers to questions. If nothing else, I am always honest, lol. Some people prefer blind comfort and support no matter what, but I tend to offer whatever I think might help, and move on if it is unwelcome advice. Hope to see you again soon. Take care, Annette""I would go see your doctor for an exam and a proper diagnosis. Meanwhile here<APO>s a trick for sore feet. Take empty 1 liter soda bottles and fill them half full of water. Stick them in the freezer and freeze them. When your feet hurt, put the bottles on the floor and roll them back and forth with your stockinged feet. You get ice and massage all at once. Might help with the discomfort. Take care, Annette""Sorry, what you describe does not sound like serotonin syndrome to me. I took multiple drugs that could all effect my serotonin levels some years back and my doctor explained that risk to me and the symptoms of serotonin syndrome, he told me to just stop the drugs in question and call him if it happened. It never did. He described serotonin syndrome as an acute event including high fever not as something with irritability and personality changes. Both drugs do lower the seizure threshold, but if you have never had seizures, it is unlikely you will start to have them. He should have explained that to you, like he should have explained serotonin syndrome to you at the beginning. Then you can make the decision of whether or not to try the meds involved. If mentally you have never felt better, then I would stay of of the antidepressants, I had a similar experience, they made me much worse mentally rather than better. I won<APO>t take them anymore. As far as your wife is concerned, all you can do is ask her if she would be willing to observe how you are on opiates alone, if that is what you want to try. Tell her that she can be the one who decides if she can tolerate you on opiates or not. If you are willing, tell her that if she decides later that you should be off of opiates, you will immediately taper off again. If you make her a part of the experiment she may be willing. Side effects of the oxycodone include nervousness, anxiety, confusion, abnormal dreams, euphoria and thought abnormalities, so your wife might be correct about you changing your personality some when on this drug. Have you discussed this with your doctor? Perhaps these side effects are dose related, if so, you may well be able to tolerate a lower dose without these side effects. Since you have already tapered off the opiates, your tolerance level should have reset back to normal and lower doses may well give you adequate pain relief. You may have to make the decision if it is her or the opiates. I don<APO>t live with you and I don<APO>t know what you were like to live with while taking these drugs. Take care, Annette""I did not find useful info at WebMD, so I Googled it and found several good articles, one at Google.com and one at the Mayo Clinic site. After reading these articles, I still don<APO>t think your irritability and personality changes were due to serotonin syndrome, but you should discus this with your doctor. Take care, Annette""Have you found any literature on a mild, chronic form of SS? I have never heard of it before. I looked up SSRIs in my Merck Manual, it says that anxiety and restlessness are among the common side effects of SSRIs. Lexapro is an SSRI. I also looked up Wellbutrin and it has a common side effect of agitation. It is not an SSRI, it does not act on the serotonin system (5-HT system) at all. In fact it ""interacts little with coadministered drugs"". It works by mediating the dopaminergic, catecholeminergic, and noradrenergic functions. By giving you both of these drugs, they pretty much covered mediating all the neurotransmitter systems connected with depression. I did look up the side effects of oxycodone and several other opiates in my drug handbook for advanced practice nurses. It lists nervousness, restlessness, anxiety and thought abnormalities along with other mental issues as happening in 1-10% of users. It sounds like any of the drugs you took could have caused irritability, agitation, and hyperactivity as side effects. I believe you said you felt better mentally after being off all the drugs. I would suggest only trying one new drug at a time from here on out, until you know if you are having any side effects. When you do develop side effects, look back and see what you have added or changed recently. It could be a dosage change or a drug interaction. Be open to whatever the doctors suggest might be causing the problem and see what happens. There is a difference between side effects and serotonin syndrome. Take care, Annette""I copied it from my browser. Try looking for an article called ""Serotonin toxicity: a practical approach to diagnosis and treatment"" by Geoffrey k. Ibister, Nicholas A. Buckley and Ian M. Whyte. It was published in a medical journal in Australia. Take care, Annette""Always glad to help, and I learned something along the way too. I would print out the article in its entirety and take it with you to the doctor to discuss. Take care, Annette""I never had any problems coming off of SSRIs, neither did my son, and we didn<APO>t even taper them, just quit them cold turkey. That was many years ago. My husband more recently went off of them, but on direction of his doctor, we decreased them by half for one week, and then went to every other day for one week, then stopped them altogether. He had no symptoms either. I don<APO>t know what to say about the people who complain of terrible withdrawal symptoms. I would just suggest a longer, slower taper. When I saw a PM specialist recently as a consult so it would be on my record, he told me I was one of the best managed chronic pain patients he had ever seen. I told him my current pain was about a 7-8 with meds, but that I was going through a flare and it was slowly improving. It had been that way for about 3-4 months, but I did not want to increase my opiates. I have been on daily opiate therapy for about 10-12 years now. I am not sure what you mean by the ""low-dose"" opiate therapy your previous two rheumies had prescribed. I would not consider the 180 mg./day of oxycontin, plus BT meds ""low dose"". I don<APO>t take that much, and I no longer consider myself low dose. I think all doctors have different experiences with opiates and choose to prescribe them differently. Since you admit to using your wife<APO>s meds occasionally for additional BT meds, and she has indicated personality changes in you when on opiates, prescribing them to you would be somewhat risky. I don<APO>t know what the ACR<APO>s position on pain management is, but I have never read any medical group saying that a doctor must prescribe opiates to anyone specifically. They tend to leave it up to doctors discretion. Maybe if you do the research, and wait it out for awhile, your wife will come around to an experimental trial on lower doses than you were on previously. I don<APO>t know. It would be hard for me to tolerate my hubby if drugs were adversely affecting him and he chose the drugs before me. The whole risk/benefit balance is different for everyone. Best of luck, please keep in touch. Take care, Annette""I am not sure I understood it correctly. It appeared that you were requesting BT meds from your wife, I interpreted that to mean they were RX<APO>d to her, but upon rereading it, I realized they could have been your meds, which she was holding for you. I am so sorry if I misunderstood it. If it turned out to be more BT doses than the doctor prescribed to you, it was still risky behavior. I discuss with my doctor what is going on before increasing any of my meds. Doctors require that level of trust to go both ways. Have you and your doctor and your wife discussed using methadone for pain? It seems to work well for many patients, tolerance does not seem to ramp up as quickly and it works differently than the other opiates you have used. I know people who stayed on the same dose for years and still got good relief. They had no trouble withdrawing from it with a reasonably slow taper. Something to think about... Take care, Annette""If you have decided that the meds are more important to your well being than your wife and she is not going to change, you could go back on your meds without telling her what you are taking. Just refuse to discuss it with her at all since you get stuck up against a wall and neither of you will change your position. Keep it between you and your doctor. My husband does not know exactly how many mgs. of anything I take, he assumes my doctor and I take care of that. He opts to have me fill his med boxes each week, so I know what he takes, but that is his choice. I have no idea who is right in your conflict with your wife, I suspect you are both partly right, and see things from different angles. Borderline personality disorder does not usually crop up in adulthood, it is usually present throughout ones life. Addiction can crop up anytime during ones life, even after years without a problem. I think you just both see things from your own perspectives. Perhaps marital therapy would be useful, or even therapy alone. Keep in touch. Take care, Annette""Never go along with having a surgical procedure imposed on you. If you can<APO>t afford it, tell the doctor that. If you just don<APO>t believe it will help you, wait until you feel the risks are worth the possible benefits. You can always ask the doctor outright if he will stop prescribing PM meds for you if you refuse this procedure. I would have a friend or family member present when you discuss this with him. A witness is always a good thing. Take care, Annette""I agree with you, interventional medicine is not for everyone. But, that is all some medical practices do, I believe it is better to know sooner than later, so you can start looking for another doctor. In my experience some pain management clinics do only interventional medicine, they only do injections and procedures. The second kind does multi-modality treatment of pain including many different kinds of interventions including oral meds. To me it is like going to a neurosurgeon or a neurologist. A neurosurgeon only does surgery, a neurologist does not do surgery, he does medical interventions. If I knew going in what I wanted, and I do, I would not set myself up for failure by going to an interventionalist program. Noncompliant is not a judgment, it is just a statement of fact that you do not wish to do what the doctor recommends. There is no law that says we have to do what any doctor recommends. I am so sorry you were treated badly. Take care, Annette""I used to go to pain.com, they have lots of info on treating chronic pain and lots of message boards. They have one section for lay people and one section for health care professionals. You can also search Medline or Medscape, but that is mostly on a health care professional level. If you need one buy a good medical dictionary to keep handy as you read. There is more and more info to be had on the internet for chronic pain patients. Meanwhile keep coming here. We have a great group here. We are all getting used to the new changes in how this site runs, but we will get used to it and things will get back to normal. Take care, Annette""Sounds like you are having some of the usual stump irritation that many amputees I have cared for complain of. I am so glad that you are doing well as far as the chronic pain goes, congratulations to you!!! That is great news. It is wonderful that you are willing to keep posting here or writing others in the same boat as you. Nothing is better than getting news from someone who has been down that road and is doing better. Take care, Annette""Hey, Gail Don<APO>t let a bad week bring you down. It really sounds to me like tapering your pain meds was ordered a bit too fast. Talk to your doctor and see what the two of you can do with your taper to make it more comfortable. If worst comes to worst, stay on the meds. If as a result of the surgery, the combination of that and your meds right after surgery makes you feel pretty good, that might be the thing to do. Anyhow, know I am thinking of you, even when I don<APO>t write. Hugs, Annette""Did you have any kind of phantom pain or pain in the stump between 2003 and recently? I guess what I am asking is this new pain or have you had it all along? It sounds like neuropathic pain, have you tried the usual adjuvant meds like antidepressants, and anti-seizure meds? You take these on a set schedule along with your regular opioid pain meds. Have you tried Lidoderm patches? I find them very useful for nerve pain. Has the doctor done any nerve blocks (that is the usual treatment for RSD, along with PT) RSD is a nasty problem to have, read up about it. Are you seeing a neurologist who knows about it? Take care, Annette""I have not had knee surgery. Regardless of what anyone says, you should do what your doctor told you to do. If he wants you walking and doing PT, then do it. Do not refuse to take the meds until the pain is unbearable, they won<APO>t work as well that way. Take them the way he has prescribed them, if the pain is too great on the prescribed dose, go see the doctor. Refill the RX and use it according to the instructions. If it seems like the pain will outlast the meds, make an appt. with the surgeon and go SEE him face to face to discuss the pain situation. Everyone is different, but a simmering infection or other problem could cause increased pain, and he should examine you to see if that is the problem. He cannot do that over the phone. It is customary for a surgeon to prescribe pain pills in 20-30 pill quantities. I know this may seem like too much trouble for you, but that is how they do it and there are reasons. The main reason is to get patients to go in and see the doctor if something is wrong, instead of just taking more pills. If you are taking one pill every four hours, you would still have some left after 48 hours. You didn<APO>t say how he prescribed them, if he said to take more than one at a time he should have you taking them less often. To protect your liver the literature says you should not take more than 4,000 mg. of acetaminophen per day, your RX will have two numbers on it after the name of the drug, probably 5/500, the first number is the mgs. of hydrocodone (the opiate), the second number is the mgs. of acetaminophen (Tylenol). Taking too much acetaminophen per dose or too much per 24 hours can cause liver damage and possibly kill you. If you have any questions about this speak to your surgeon or your pharmacist. Take care, Annette""I am glad things are going better for you. I have found that after surgery just when I thought things were too bad to tolerate, they started getting better. I would suggest you time your meds so that you can take a pain pill about an hour prior to your PT appt. so your pain will be covered. Have someone drive you there and back. PT is very important in your recovery, so you need to do it if possible. If the pain prevents you from doing your PT as prescribed, make an appt. to go see your surgeon. Take care, Annette""I would add that I feel it is always worthwhile to find the most experienced doctor to do any surgery you might need. Expertise is gained through doing the procedure. Surgeons I have spoken to tell me that to be truly proficient a surgeon should have done the procedure you are considering at least 100 times, and should continue to do about 4-5 per week. Practice makes perfect and reduces adverse effects and the time your body is surgically ""open"" which affects infection rates. As a nurse, I feel it is also important to consider the hospital or surgical center where you will be a patient. You want to go somewhere where the nurses are proficient in the area you are considering. I feel a pain management team is important to those of us who have been on chronic pain management meds. You want the facility to have an active anti-MRSA program. I personally prefer hospitals who have achieved ""Magnet"" status. I personally feel that the top doctor at a hospital with a high MRSA rate might not be as good a choice as the second best doctor at the top hospital with a lower infection rate. When my family required orthopedic surgery, I researched the hospitals and orthopedic surgeons in my area that were covered on our insurance. Each time we got one of the top three surgeons in our state and had the surgery done at one of the top three hospitals. Different each time because one was a pediatric surgery and one was an adult surgery. Take care, Annette""Ask away, I don<APO>t know if I have the answers, but I will give you my best shot. Take care, Annette""I suggest you take your doctor<APO>s phone number with you to the hospital. You can call him yourself if need be. Nothing gets us nurses on our toes like a surgeon calling and complaining that one of his patients called him in the middle of the night because they were in pain!!! The hospital we use has a pain management team for all the patients in the hospital who need pain management. They are great. I do agree that everyone should have an adult friend or family member with them at all times in the hospital to be their advocate. Remind everyone who touches you or your bedding to wash their hands first!!! Take care, Annette""It depends on what is compressed, did you compress a disc or do you have a compression fracture of the T12 vertebrae? With the first, it is usually just a wait and get well thing. If you fractured the vertebrae they usually make you a corset-type brace to wear until it heals. Either way they use pain meds until you get well. Take care, Annette""Excuse me, does the doctor think this is a new injury, or does he believe it is from the injury many years ago? If it is old, it is probably already healed as far as the bone goes. Take care, Annette""From that reading of the MRI, it sounds like they are talking about the bone of the T12 vertebrae, since they said ""no bone edema to suggest acute injury"". That probably has nothing to do with any pain you are having now. See a neurologist or your own doctor to ask how any of this might relate to your present pain. It may well be none of it is relevant. Take care, Annette""I agree with the ARNP. A careful examination and history gives the practitioner a lot of information. I think that she gave you a good starting off place as far as treatment goes. I would avoid deep tissue massage for now. See how your symptoms go and discuss this with your doctor or ARNP in 2-3 weeks if you are still having symptoms. Do what they tell you. Without any neurological deficits, I would put off the scans for now. See what happens in a few weeks. Take care, Annette""My understanding of the emergency spinal symptoms that include bowel and bladder problems are that they cause you to be incontinent (leaking), not blocked up. Being unable to move your bowels, or to retain urine, seems more likely to be the result of opioid treatment like your ARNP said. Each pain management practice has their own favorite way to manage bowel care and prevent constipation. Glad to hear her tips are working for you. Take care, Annette""Do the narcotics help your pain? Why are you trying to get off of them if they do? I use a lot of different treatment interventions in addition to my meds. Things like stretches, and my hot tub, pacing my activities, massage, etc. I feel if I get a small amount of relief from each of several interventions, the total amount of relief is worthwhile. Take care, Annette""I had a nurse friend in Reno that worked at the same hospital as me. She had surgery with a severe adverse effect. She felt there was an error in the OR that caused it. She reported it to the state medical board. Her surgeon told her he had done all he could for her, and discharged her from his practice. She tried making appts. with other orthopedic surgeons in town and not one would see her. She had to go out of state to find a doctor to continue her care. As a nurse, I have seen this happen to other patients who ""caused trouble"", the doctors told each other and no one in town would see the patient. It is totally unprofessional, but it does happen. No surgeon wants an unhappy patient to sue him for an adverse outcome. The doctors who participate in this are not professional, but they are out there, they just look out for themselves first. Take care, Annette""I wouldn<APO>t get involved with any complaint system until after you find a doctor you can work with and get established with him. You can get blackballed, especially in a relatively small medical community. It can also end up a matter of he said/she said. The doctors can say that in their medical opinion they were recommending the best treatment for you, especially since you saw two of them and they both suggested injections rather than opiates. You did say in a previous post that one of the PM docs you went to advertised himself as an interventionist. I would just stick to finding a doctor you can work with for now. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t have an answer for your particular situation. Only you can decide what to do. If there are no doctors in your area who will write for opiates, I can<APO>t change that. Take care, Annette""You are very naive if you really believe that patients do not get blackballed for doing things like reporting a doctor to the medical board or leaving a doctor without a good reason. In small medical communities especially, doctors do talk to each other and warn each other about ""difficult"" patients. It is not professional, but it is done. Take care, Annette""Thank you for the direct answer. I have already decided to cut back my use of WebMD to one board, this one. I will see how things go, and how long it takes to read posts. Then I will decide what to do next. I don<APO>t really see how the new tools will replace the email digests yet. On this board I want to be able to read through all the posts so I can make suggestions and learn new things. Having heard of the new applications, they don<APO>t seem to apply. I do not want to only hear/read posts from old friends, or just certain topics. You never know where you will learn something new or meet a person that you want to know more about. Often a thread will start on one topic and then morph into another topic. Will the new applications pass on part of a thread and not all of it based on the beginning topic or the new topic? Will your new software read the headers or the whole thread? We have tried reminding members on the FMS Support Board for instance to use the headers to indicate the topic of the thread, but it doesn<APO>t happen. Some of us figured that way we could sort through and not read the things we were not interested in. There are lots of off topic and social posting on that board. I prefer to read medical info and drug questions. I already miss some things like that, because I usually scroll through all the ""Good Morning"" posts about the weather, etc. in my email digests. I just glance through them. I can<APO>t even imagine going through the board post by post. I guess we will see. Hugs, Annette""They told me at the Ambassadors phone conference that the email digests would stop with the new changes, do you know when that will happen yet? As you know, that is how I use the boards that I visit, I will probably not have the time or energy to continue at all the boards that I currently visit. I would hate to just stop getting the email digests with no warning. Thanks for all your hard work. Hugs, Annette""I guess each phone conference might be a bit different, as different people attend and ask different questions. I asked directly about the digests because I use them and had seen something on the boards about them. I voiced the same concerns as you do. Even working as they do, it is far less time consuming and way easier to read the boards through the digests than it is directly. Those of us in pain all the time can<APO>t sit at computers for hours on end. This board would be my first priority, we will just see how it goes. Take care, Annette""Many years ago, when there was a new post, the whole thread did get bumped to the top again. But, WebMD changed it and told us all to get used to it, that it is the way it was going to be. It has been changed again a couple of times since then from what I hear, but that was when I went to te email digests. I have not used the boards directly, or any other part of WebMD since then. Now, you are changing things around again. Several of us only come here because we have developed attachments to the other community members. I hope we do not lose too many people to this change. I am still trying. But, I cannot get a straight answer to when the email digests are going to be ""suspended"". I was told it might be sometime close to when the new things start, but that was some time ago. When can I expect them to stop arriving? I know none of this has anything to do with you personally, you are a great moderator. Hugs, Annette""People do not die from withdrawals from opiates, particularly if you were basically healthy to start out with, as in no heart disease. Withdrawals from benzos and other meds are something else altogether, and can be very dangerous. Take care, Annette""Since you have done it before when you ran out of percocet, you know what it will be like if you just quit. Everyone varies somewhat when it comes to withdrawals, some people have more severe symptoms than others do. What you mentioned sounds about what I would expect in someone taking the amount of oxycodone that you are taking. There is no reason for you to quit cold turkey unless you want to. You can get another RX and taper off more slowly, as one of the other posters suggested. You can avoid withdrawal symptoms altogether that way, but you will still deal with your original pain, and will need to work with your doctor on a pain management program. Many people do that without using opiates. Since you have noticed a desire to smoke and this seems to be your motivation to stop using percocet, I would discuss this with your doctor. Perhaps a different opiate would help your pain, without giving you that urge. He could also tell you if a nicotene substitute would be medically appropriate for you, and what risks they include. Then the two of you decide what to do. Everyone has different cancer risk factors, you and your doctor can figure out what yours are and how much you should worry. You might feel better if you get regular checkups to insure early detection. Take care, Annette""I totally agree with you, dancingfree48. Unless the person is withdrawing from more than just plain old opioids, there really is no danger for a basically healthy adult. Benzos and alcohol are entirely different things than opioids, withdrawal from those can cause seizures, and other life threatening problems. Take care, Annette""Tell the doctor what you have written here. Let him know that you need better pain control so you can achieve<UD><UD><UD><UD><UD><UD> goals in your life. Fill in the blank. Let him know you are looking for better function in your life. Ask him for specifics, and keep repeating that like a broken record if he doesn<APO>t give you anything solid. If at the end of the appt. you still don<APO>t feel like you have solid things to try, ask him for a referral to someone else if he has no suggestions. Take care, Annette""You had some serious injuries. I am so glad to hear you are doing so well, especially with your positive attitude. Take care, Annette""You also cannot go by postings you see on line. Many people who have a good outcome, disappear from the boards and have a life again. They are too busy to bother with posting. The ones with things to complain about keep coming back to complain. Take care, Annette""Discuss this with your doctor. Most meds have some side effects, particularly when you first start taking them. Most go away after a week or two. You and your partner or another adult should sit down with your kids and explain to them that you are trying some new medicines and if they notice any changes in you to just speak up. Is your doctor used to prescribing these meds? No one should be started on fentanyl unless they are already dependent on opiates at a certain daily dose. There is a lower fentanyl dose if you feel like you are drunk on it. Usually slurred speech, blurred vision and a drunken feeling is because the dose is a bit higher than you need. Take care, Annette""Tendinitis does not ""spread"" like that. It is time to go see your doctor for another evaluation and find out what is going on. Take care, Annette""I am SOOO glad you got to go to your daughter<APO>s wedding. No mother should miss their child<APO>s wedding if it is possible to go. My son is coming up on his fourth anniversary. No wedding turns out exactly like they envisioned, so don<APO>t worry about that. Being married in a museum sounds lovely. I don<APO>t know how I stayed on my feet for the whole day of my son<APO>s wedding, looking back it seems impossible, lol. It must have been wonderful to see all your old friends, even if some of them were related to your ex. I adore my brother<APO>s ex, she was wonderful. I wish we could have kept in touch. She thought it best for him if she dropped out of our family. Not!!! Good luck with your PM doc appt. I hope it goes well. I did read about the amputation, and I thought of you. I have severe doubts about this kind of surgery for folks with RSD, but of course, it is your decision to make. To research hospitals, I got a list of which hospitals were covered by insurance, and only checked those out. I called the orthopedic floors and spoke with the charge nurses in late evening when things were quieter. I asked how many patients with that type of surgery they had on their unit each week. I asked what their infection rate was. I asked especially what their patient to nurse ratio was. The more patients each nurse is assigned to, the higher the complication rate (especially infections) according to nursing research. I also called the recovery room charge nurse, and asked some of the same questions. I also asked what both units did for pain management for folks with chronic pain. I prefer hospitals that have pain management teams who handle pain issues rather than the surgeons. MRSA is a big deal here, so I also asked if they had programs in place to prevent MRSA. Not too many hospitals do, but it is still a good thing to ask. For that question, I asked to speak to the hospital Infection Control Nurse. My pain levels have been really high for the last 4-5 months. If they don<APO>t improve significantly by my doctor<APO>s appt. in Nov. I will ask her about changing meds or something. I went to visit a friend in June to help clear her mom<APO>s house to sell. Her mom had died. It is a two story house, so I did way too much up and down the stairs. I knew afterward I would suffer for awhile, but I hoped it would only last a month or so. When I saw my doc in Sept. I was starting to feel a bit better, but you know how it is, two steps forward and one step back. I got some worse again, now it is some better. I may have turned the corner, I hope so. I use ambien too. I can still usually tell the difference between dreams and reality. I would still rather sleep than not either way. It can cause vivid dreams, but so do all the other sleep aids. Let your friend come help you when he can. It does so much good for folks to do for their friends, we can<APO>t always be the doers, sometimes we have to let others do for us. Let<APO>s just hope we both do better down the road. Hugs, Annette""I would find a neurologist who deals with RSD on a regular basis. Perhaps at a university medical center, like UCLA, UCSF, etc. Tertiary care facilities have more experience with severe cases of anything. They get the patients that were not helped by local doctors. I found it worth flying from Reno down to San Francisco to UCSF Medical Center for advice about migraines from a neurologist. Benadryl made me hallucinate at a certain point, vivid!!! I had such a bad cotton mouth with it, that I switched to the ambien. I<APO>ll be fine. You take care of yourself. Hugs, Annette""I suggested a neurologist because they are the ones who deal with RSD where I live. But that is not true in all geographical areas. You are right, there really seems to be no specialty that has taken over treating the RSD population completely. If there is a PM doc who specializes in RSD in Dallas, and you can get there, that might be the best option for you. I wish I had the answers for you. Hugs, Annette""No one can tell you if something else will work as well for your depression, FMS, pain, etc. We all react differently to pain meds. All you can do is decide to try something else or not. Take care, Annette""Write a list of the concerns that you wish to discuss with the doctor and take it with you to the appt. I do this, and then we just go through the list and cross things off. I write down any instructions my doc gives me so I don<APO>t forget. You can always take a friend or family member with you and they can take notes. Take care, Annette PS, I strongly advise against leaving messages in any form for your doctor. Make an appt. and see him in person.""I am not sure how you ended up with nerve damage from lumbar surgery causing pain in your right arm?? That does not make sense to me... I personally do not believe in trying any surgical procedure until after one has tried ALL the non-surgical methods of controlling pain and failed in attaining adequate relief. You only mentioned one long acting opiate, fentanyl patches. There are also a number of long acting opiates in oral form. There are also a number of other anti-nausea meds besides phenergan that you could try if nausea becomes a problem. Usually, nausea will go away with time on opiates. There are also other meds that can be used for pain management in the antidepressant family. They mediate the neurotransmitters that control the perception of pain in the brain. By waiting until your pain is out of control to take your pain meds, you doom them to not working as well as they could. They should be taken early on in the pain escalation process. Medical studies done back in the 60s showed that people who took their opiates early on took less opiates than the people who waited until their pain was severe and then took their meds. They also got better relief. Most people with chronic pain who use opiates take a long acting opiate on a set schedule to maintain their blood levels so they don<APO>t have big up and down swings of pain relief. It is thought that this also slows the buildup of tolerance. Usually they also take a short acting opiate like Norco or Percocet for any breakthrough pain they have due to increased activity (or for no reason at all). They may take this 1-4 times a day depending on their doctor<APO>s instructions. Some people also take an anti-inflammatory for added relief depending on their condition and their previous medical history. You list RA, OA, and FMS, so it would be important that you control all your sources of pain. Your pcp<APO>s concern that if you get cancer you would have no pain meds available just isn<APO>t true. You can always take more pain meds if you need them, as long as you can tolerate any side effects, and are well supervised. There is no upper limit that one cannot go beyond with opiates while supervised by their doctor. Besides, you may never get cancer, you have pain NOW. Before deciding on a surgical procedure, I would get two opinions from independent surgeons who implant this sort of device. Not two from the same practice, but two from different practices. See if you are a good candidate for this procedure. Tell them up front you are just collecting information, and have not made a decision yet. Be sure and ask them what their infection rate is, as well as the rate of any other complications. Any doctor who tells you that his patients never get infected should scare you. One told my husband that when we were looking for a surgeon to replace his hip. We never saw him again. It sounds like you have already found one surgeon to interview, now you need to find another. I would also see a pain management specialist who manages pain with meds including opiates, and also uses other forms of pain management. I strongly feel that if I use several different treatment techniques and get a small amount of relief from each of them, the total amount of relief I can get can be substantial. Charles posted a link recently to research regarding injections and procedures and how well they work. I would find that and read it thoroughly. I would not consent to any invasive procedure unless I had evidence based medicine showing that it was of considerable benefit. I would also need to know how the doctor decided I would make a good candidate for the procedure. Choosing the right candidates is key. Only after doing all of this do I feel you can make an informed decision. Keep in touch. Take care, Annette""No problem on my side. Hugs, Annette""If you are taking them as prescribed by a doctor it won<APO>t be a problem. If you are taking them illegally you may be out of luck. Most drugs are detectable in urine screens for about three days after the last dose. Take care, Annette""I am glad to know that tylenol can kill your liver if you take too much. And that NSAIDs cause GI bleeding, I already knew that from working in the ER, but what is the problem of giving that information to the general public? The ""Feds"" did not make any new rules about over the counter meds, they just allowed us to have more information so we can make informed choices. Take care, Annette""In what way does the government force our doctors to make any decisions about patient treatment? It certainly does not interfere with my treatment choices made with my doctor. What treatments do you feel the government is preventing our doctors from using? Communism is an economic system, it has nothing whatever to do with the practice of medicine, I have no idea at all where you are going with this one? According to at least one poll, over 60% of the public here in the US feel that there should be a major overhaul of our health care system, including a government sponsored plan to compete with the insurance companies. I agree. But, I don<APO>t think they are taking it far enough, I believe in a single payer system with NO insurance companies at all. If you are anti-government run insurance, will you turn away from Medicare when you become eligible? You are going for SSDI so you can<APO>t be too anti-government. I hope your SSDI decision is a fair one, and that it comes soon. Waiting around for that is very demoralizing, I remember. The judge does have your life in his hands. Take care, Annette""What actual laws concerning drugs have been changed since MJ died? I am not aware of any, and would be glad to learn. ALL narcotic pain meds are not derived from opium poppies. There are a wide variety of synthetic ones available now. Hydrocodone, oxycodone, methadone, fentanyl, are just the ones that come off the top of my head. I am taking a four hour class at our local college titled, ""Using opioids for pain, know the laws and guidelines"", on Oct. 26. I will share what I learn there here. I expect it to be interesting. I have taken other classes from the same instructor. Take care, Annette""The DEA did not tell your doctor what he could and could not prescribe, your doctor decided not to deal with pain meds at all. That is his right, but don<APO>t blame it on the government. How can he manage his patients properly without ever using narcotics? I wouldn<APO>t go to him. Some illnesses require pain management, if only for a short time. The DEA does not make treatment decisions, individual doctors do. You say, ""They are removing the physician<APO>s right to choose the medication that would best treat their patient<APO>s pain."" I will ask you again, what drugs have the DEA said that doctors may not prescribe to their patients during this recent crackdown? Where can I find this information on the DEA website? I have read nothing about this in my nursing journals or on medical websites. The FDA is the agency that determines the safety of medication, they are the ones that pull unsafe drugs from the maket. The DEA deals with enforcement regarding mostly drug dealing and over-prescribing. My doctor has altered her practice somewhat so that she documents more completely those things she and the state feels are important to document for pain patients. I have been seeing her for about 12 years, now and she has updated her policies 3-4 times over the years as new information comes out. A few months ago, she asked all her chronic pain patients to sign updated pain medicine consent forms and pain contracts. She asked everyone on pain meds to get a ""recent"" consult with a pain management doctor to evaluate how our treatment was working for us. I hadn<APO>t had one in about 12 years, I don<APO>t think that was too much to ask of me. I went and saw a PM specialist and after one hour of talking about my history and treatment, he complimented me and my doctor, he said I was ""one of the best managed chronic pain patients he had ever seen."" So, now his report is in my file. The state of Oregon where I live, has specific chronic pain management guidelines, as long as the doctors practice within those guidelines and document their care, they do not get hassled by anyone. The DEA is a federal agency, and if they are ""cracking down"", it seems like they would do it where they find abuses. If your doctor was prescribing and documenting properly, he would have no trouble with them at all. If he is doing 2 minute, monthly appts. and handing out huge amounts of drugs without proper diagnosis and evaluation, then he deserves to be appraised by the DEA. I am a nurse, I am a pain management patient, and I just do not see a big DEA crackdown on doctors who manage pain appropriately. I do see some doctors using that as an excuse to not treat chronic pain. But, it is more likely that they just do not want to deal with figuring out who is a drug abuser after drugs to get high on, and who isn<APO>t. That takes an incredible amount of time out of your day, and drains your energy. I understand that, but I feel it is still a part of my doctor<APO>s job to treat my pain and help make me functional. Take care, Annette""According to my handbook for drugs for advanced practice nurses, suboxone is made up of two drugs, buprenorphine and naloxone. The half life of buprenorphine is 2.2-3 hours, and the half life of naloxone is 1-1 1/2 hours according to this book. I would check with your pharmacist for the correct answer to your question. It depends on what kind of drug test they are using, if they are looking for suboxone to make sure you are taking it, they will be testing for it. If they are looking for drugs of abuse, they may not test for it. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t think the purpose of this pain management board is to tell people how to try and beat a drug screening test. Most herbal cleanse systems to help one beat urine tests are a bunch of hooey anyway. They take your money and could care less what happens after that. The person doing the test can figure out if you have drunk a lot of water because your urine will come out very diluted. I have known work places that automatically tossed specimens like that and considered the person guilty and they were fired. If the drug was prescribed legally and the person took it as prescribed, there will be no problem. If this is someone who is trying to beat the test, that is their problem. Take care, Annette""I would call your pharmacist and ask about this. They get the most recent updates on adverse effects of medicines. You could also call the drug company that makes it and ask for the adverse effects reporting department and ask them if anything like that has been reported before. Meanwhile, continue seeing the doctor for answers, perhaps a neurologist would be helpful. Take care, Annette""I would see a neurologist for this kind of problem. Take care, Annette""I agree with maninpain. Just tell your doctor that your present meds aren<APO>t working well enough for you. I don<APO>t believe that there is any magic combo that works for everyone. I have stayed on morphine and hydrocodone/APAP for about ten years now with only minor adjustments every 3-4 years. It continues to work for me, and both are available in generic. I prefer to stick with the generics drugs if possible. I wouldn<APO>t bother with any more injections if the last one didn<APO>t work very well. Take care, Annette""Ditto what Lori said. Seeing a physical therapist is fine, but they should not be contradicting what your surgeon told you as far as weight limits. Lifting more weight until you have a sudden pain sounds dumb to me, by then it would be too late, the damage would be done. Go see the original surgeon if possible, another orthopedic surgeon is the next best thing. Come clean about cheating on the weight lifting. Take care, Annette""Does the electric stimulation work for her pain? What does her neurologist suggest as pain management techniques that are financially workable for you? He must have other seizure patients that have chronic pain. I know some antiseizure meds can be taken with opiates, would it be possible for her to change seizure meds so she can take opiates? Take care, Annette""Versed (a benzodiazepine) does interact with opiates and other benzodiazepines, so he may be correct. I have heard through the grapevine of patients who did not respond to the versed as the doctor planned, but I have not had a patient like that myself. It sounds like one of the less common side effects. Perhaps you were just not given a high enough dose out of concern that it would interact badly with your other meds? I would ask you if the ablation worked on that first test? Did it relieve your pain? If it did not work the first or second time, I certainly could not be talked into trying it again. Let alone seven times. Take care, Annette""I read in your original post that you were considering having three levels done on your neck and four on your back?? Or vice versa?? 3+4=7 I didn<APO>t know whether they do them all at once, or one level at a time. You know how hard it is to communicate accurately on line, don<APO>t worry about it. I have never had any of these invasive procedures done myself. Do they have to do the two tests on each level to make sure they have the right nerve each time? That sounds ghastly. Do you have double blind research studies to show that these laser treatments work long term for what you have? Sounds interesting but dubious. I am a generally cynical sort of person, I want to see proof that a treatment works at least 75% of the time before I volunteer. Take care, Annette""I am glad it seems to be working for you. I hope you get good relief. Then you will have to change your user name? Don<APO>t you dare change it to something like ""FMSGirl"", go for a positive attribute. Take care, Annette""Lots of people abuse benzos, they do take them to get high, and they do take them with opiates, stop breathing, and die. Sad but true. I am not sure how you are taking your meds the way you wrote them down. When you say you take ""Xanax .05 mg. 3 prn"", does that mean you take 3 pills at once when you feel you need them, or do you take one pill 3 times a day as needed? How far apart do you take them? Do you take all three doses every day? Have you gradually increased the dosage or the number of pills you take per day? It sounds like you have not had to do that. According to my drug book, they don<APO>t come in 0.05 mg. doses, I think you meant to write 0.5 mg. The problem with benzos is that people do develop tolerance and often require higher doses to get the desired effect, but their bodies do not always tolerate the higher or more frequent doses. There is a ceiling for the dose, unlike opiates. Withdrawal symptoms can include seizures and may be deadly if not medically supervised, so be careful. They potentiate the central nervous system depressant effects of opiates. They increase the risk of falling also. Is your family doctor prescribing your pain management meds? I have never heard of neurontin being taken prn, I take it once a day, every day to maintain blood levels and pain control. I think it works great for me. Take care, Annette""I misunderstood, you said in your original post that your family doctor would not increase your percocet to anything stronger, and it was not working for your pain. I thought that meant you would have to go to a PM doc for stronger pain meds. I usually opt to increase my other meds before I increase the opiates. You avoid developing tolerance too quickly that way. I went up to 1800 mg. a day of neurontin at one time, then gradually backed off to 800 mg. per day. My doc says some of her pain patients use up to 3200 mg. per day without any bad side effects as long as they increase it slowly. 800 mg. seems to be my magic number, at that dose I get good results and still feel like myself. You also have some sort of respiratory problems, asthma or COPD? You use two meds that are for opening up your breathing passages, albuterol and advair. That also makes the benzos and opiate interaction something to be very aware of. They can affect your breathing. That may have something to do with why your doctor does not want to increase your percocet. I don<APO>t know. It sounds like you have a great family to support you through your life. That is so very important. It is good to get your input here. Take care, Annette""I thought you said in the other post that you took the neurontin prn as needed. I may have misunderstood. I have been on neurontin about 10 years now. My doctor suggested I try neurontin about two years before I did try it. It was always prescribed three times a day and I was afraid of feeling sedated all day as I am very sensitive to sedation from meds. I didn<APO>t want to even try it. A couple of years later, she told me that many of her chronic pain patients were taking neurontin just once a day at bedtime. It still worked for their pain and also helped them sleep a little better. I was willing to try it once a day at bedtime. I started out at 300 mg. once a day, I finally took it about 4-5 hours before bedtime, that way I wasn<APO>t groggy when I woke up. I increased it by 300 mg. once a week until I was up to 1800 mg. I stayed at that dose for a few months, then when I was feeling some better, I found I was lethargic in the daytime, not sedated, so much as just lazy, good for nothing, laying around. After discussing it with my doctor, I decreased it by 300 mg. per day, once a week, until I got down to 900 mg. per day. That worked fine, with no side effects. After a while I asked her if I could take just one pill a day instead of three 300 mg. capsules. It was available in 800 mg. generic tablets, so I switched to that. It has been fine for me. My doctor told me some of her pain patients take up to 3200 mg. per day. It is a very individual thing with the dosing of this drug. Good luck with your neurontin. I hope it works as well for you as it has for me. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know why anyone would take their opiates in higher doses than prescribed. You can overdose on opiates or you can overdose on benzos alone. Both can stop breathing if taken in higher doses than prescribed. I took valium (the original benzo) many years ago for help sleeping, it was the best high I ever had, I flushed them down the toilet after three days because I knew if there was any drug I could get hooked on this was it. I would be very pleasantly loaded for about an hour, then drift off to sleep. I was giving klonopin just at bedtime, about ten years ago and told it would not cause the problems valium had. It didn<APO>t, but when I wrecked my car and decided to get off of all meds, it caused severe withdrawal that required medical care. I wasn<APO>t on opiates back then. Now, I just stay away from all benzos all the time. Just my choice. If you have grown tolerant to the benzos at the dose you are on now, then they really are no longer giving you the desired effect the way I understand it. So, why not taper off of them? Just a thought? I was just sharing the info I got at a pain management class about the most recent research. It is what it is. Take care, Annette""My old therapist where I used to live gave me a book called, ""Feeling Good"" by Doctor David Burns, MD. This is a book all about CBT and how to use it, either with a therapist or on your own. I love this book. I have used it, and bought new copies and handed them out to my friends and family members who were in need of it. Everyone loves it. It has pages you can use to track your progress. Good luck!!! I cured my depression using it after I stopped working. Take care, Annette""I didn<APO>t say you were taking more than prescribed, I am sorry if you got that impression. I specifically said ""anyone"". I never tell anyone to change their meds without their doctor<APO>s supervision. The info I gave about not prescribing opiates and benzos together was from a class I took on pain management for health care professionals. I know lots of doctors prescribe them that way, and I know lots of people take them that way. That does not change the latest medical research information. I am just sharing information, and I did say where it came from. Take care, Annette""I call and remind the doctor a week before I will run out of meds. That gives the doctor plenty of time to write out the RX and leave it for me at the front desk. All the doctors I know give the patient a copy of the pain med contract to take home. I abide by mine religiously. It is illegal for another doctor to write you a RX for percocet unless he has examined you personally. You would have to make an appt. to see one of your doctor<APO>s associates if you wanted them to write you a RX. They also have to agree that that is the correct thing to do for you. If you are worried about the same thing happening at your new clinic, just ask the doctor how their refill system works and when you should call to remind them you need a refill. Take care, Annette""I think your ortho surgeon is wise in suggesting injections before offering surgery. I also believe in doing the less invasive treatments first. I agree with using meds orally before trying injections for the same reason. That said, I don<APO>t believe in prescribing opiates and benzos. I think it is unsafe. I took a class in pain management last year and they recommended against it. They said research shows an increase in adverse events due to interactions and an increase in overdoses. When doctors say they are worried about the government, DEA, etc. and prescribing opiates, I think they usually have other reasons and don<APO>t wish to argue about them, or they just feel they don<APO>t know enough to manage them properly. Having a psychiatrist prescribe anti-psychotic meds and a neurologist prescribe anti-seizure meds is just part of a doctor saying ,""I am not an expert in all fields and sometimes need help."" You are taking an antidepressant, an anxiolytic, an anti-seizure med, an NSAID, and an opiate. I can understand why your family doctor feels a PM doc should take over the pain management at least. He is probably feeling like he is running out of tools and not fixing anything. With depression, anxiety, and chronic pain, seeing a good therapist may be very helpful. You said in another post that you are starting with a new PM clinic, I hope it works out for you. Did you speak to them ahead of time to determine if they use oral meds and other non-invasive treatments to control pain? You don<APO>t want to get a PM doc who only does interventions like injections and ablations if you are looking to control your pain with meds. Take care, Annette""You might ask your insurance company to send you their formulary, so you know what drugs are covered and which ones aren<APO>t. Our insurance is a three tier system where most brand name drugs are really expensive, and common generic drugs are the cheapest copays. I took my booklet with me to the doctor<APO>s office and explained to her that I would prefer to take the generic drugs whenever possible. When I have the booklet with me it saves her time in picking out the drug we will try next. Doctors can<APO>t possibly keep track of everyone<APO>s different insurance plans. Hugs, Annette""I personally don<APO>t think it is safe to take benzos like klonopin and lorazepam with opiates like fentanyl and percocet. That is what I have been taught, but doctors are the ones prescribing the meds. I also don<APO>t think klonopin is a good drug for muscle spasms, that use is not listed in my drug book under approved uses or off-label uses. I would be concerned about starting three new drugs all at once, because then if you have side effects, it is nearly impossible to tell which drug is causing them. I think, if you are thinking you are having a reaction to one of the new meds, you should be calling the doctor who prescribed them and talking to her. Ask her if she feels all your meds taken the same day are safe for you, read off a list of each medicine, the dose and how many times per day you take it. For ""as needed"" drugs, average out how often you have taken it in the last week, and tell her that. No one here knows what your psychiatrist did or didn<APO>t read in your chart before prescribing your new meds. Your pharmacist is another person to speak to for advice in this topic. Take care, Annette""My understanding of spina bifida occulta is that one usually has no symptoms at all. What is going on with you and your SB occulta? If your doctor sees your leg with knots and changing colors, then he will at least know you have something going on and are not making the whole thing up. RA sometimes does not have a positive blood test in the beginning. You may opt to get retested in a year or so. Are you saying the neighbor went through your trash and got a RX bottle and called your doctor? That does sound a bit far-fetched. Now, you know to remove the label from the bottle before you toss them in the trash. I<APO>ve always done that with all my RXs. You did not say what you were taking, how frequently, and for how long, so it is hard to say if you are going into withdrawals. Or even what your symptoms are. Most people will get their old pain back, but not everyone goes through significant withdrawals. You better find another doctor. Goodwill, Salvation Army, and Catholic Charities are places that may be able to tell you about free clinics in your area. You can also Google ""free clinics, city and state, USA"" and see what comes up. Take care, Annette""Go back to your OB doc and find out why you are having so much pain. Cramping from a miscarriage that requires narcotics shouldn<APO>t last more than about 4 days. It is possible you retained some tissue and that is what is causing your pain. If you develop a fever see a doctor immediately!!! Both pills have the same amount of tylenol in them, 325 mg. Take care, Annette""Before having spinal surgery of any kind, I would see a neurologist (not a neurosurgeon) and ask what my treatment options are. I would also see a pain management specialist who uses many modalities for treatment, and ask him what my options are. I would not opt for any kind of spinal surgery for pain relief only. I would use all the various other options. If I were losing function, couldn<APO>t walk properly, or couldn<APO>t use my hands properly, I would consider surgery. Of course, if you are incontinent due to a spinal problem that is another thing altogether. If all you are taking for pain is hydrocodone 7.5/500, there are probably lots of different meds still for you to try. That is usually one of the first pain meds the doctors prescribe. Take care, Annette""The problem is you cannot measure pain with MRIs, CTs, or xrays. Many people have terrible scans and no pain at all, and others have normal scans and terrible pain. If there was a test that showed doctors whether or not a person really had the pain they claimed, then pain management would be an easy job. But, there isn<APO>t such a test. Doctors have to figure it out as best they can. They get the big money and a long education to learn to do that. How would you feel if a doctor announced he was no longer going to give out high blood pressure medicine, antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics, or insulin? Just stop prescribing a whole class of drugs? I refuse to consent to any kind of surgery just so my doctor can refuse to prescribe opiates responsibly. If pain meds are a better option for me than surgery, I expect my doctor to say so. Even if they are just a different option, he should explain the risks and benefits of ALL appropriate treatments. If a patient cannot take opiates due to side effects or other health issues, fine, but a real doctor offers his patients all the treatment options medically appropriate for their condition. Just my opinion. Take care, Annette""Thank you for your kind words. Take care, Annette""I am so glad to hear you have found a doctor to manage your pain meds, and that you and your daughter have at least opened communications again. What wonderful news!!! I hope this contact with your daughter brings you both love and support. Just last Monday you posted here that there were no doctors in your state that would manage your pain, I am so happy that one popped up. No one deserves to be treated poorly. Hugs, Annette""I am so sorry to hear about your sister<APO>s death. My condolences to you and her other loved ones. The sooner they find some easy way to tell the difference between chronic pain patients and addicts, the better it will be for all of us. Both are terrible illnesses and both need to be treated early and promptly. Take care, Annette""My son and DIL and I plan to buy a family compound like the Kennedys have, when we hit the lotto. We will all have our own homes, but all in one area. You are right though, you have to play to win. I don<APO>t know how to work the Powerball machine, so I give my hubby the $$ and he has the guy at the little corner store run off the tickets for me. They pick the numbers randomly. So far, nothing, lol. But I don<APO>t play regularly. For lunch there is a great little place on the coast in southern Oregon, overlooks a great view, and they have wonderful food. Take care, good luck with the new doctors. I hope someone comes up with something to help you. Hugs, Annette""I have lived in the boonies and the city and have lived in three states, and frankly I have never really had any trouble getting opiate pain meds legally through doctors. When I lived in Reno and needed a neurologist for migraine treatment, there were none I felt good about in Reno, so I flew to SF and went to UC SF Medical Center and got a consult there. I slept on my brother<APO>s couch for that one night. He did a consult and sent a report to my family doctor. I had one doctor out in the boonies at the only medical clinic in town, that was pushing long acting meds on me before I was ready to do that. I left his practice and I did drive for an hour and a half to a rheumatologist who was happy to keep me on short acting opiates at that time. I found another internist an hour away, and told him the rheumy was managing my opiates and I wouldn<APO>t need him for that. After three or four visits, he offered to manage my opiates too if I wished. I hear people on line say the things you do, but I have never experienced it, not as a patient and not as a nurse. Everywhere I have lived there were doctors who played it safe, and doctors who were willing to do what it took to keep their patients functional and comfortable. It was just a matter of finding the doctors who fit with my style and way of doing things. Patients vote on their doctors<APO> behavior by walking out the door. They can only act like that if we let them. If it means moving to a different place geographically, then I would do it. My health is more important than anything else in my life. Without decent medical care I cannot manage my home and family responsibilities. I would not try an invasive treatment no matter what kind of pain I had, if I knew that I could be managed medically. I feel really strongly about that. I have been in a position to refuse surgery before and I did refuse it. The odds were so against the result I wanted and the risks were too great. Your decision is your decision, mine is mine. I hope things go well for you whatever you decide. Take care, Annette""I have been seeing doctors for pain management since I was 35 years old and I am now 59. I started working as a nurse in 1970. No doctor has ever told me they were worried about the DEA. None have changed their practices due to the DEA, other than being more careful with documentation. I have lived paycheck to paycheck for much of that time, I have been on SSDI for the last 12 years or so. We are not wealthy. I have moved to a different state with only $20 left until I got my first paycheck at my new job. If you can<APO>t drive 10 minutes comfortably, then you need to live close to a bunch of doctors and hospitals. If economic times are so tough that you can<APO>t do that immediately, then start saving your change or tuck an extra $ away when you can and save up to move. Anyone who truly has no friends or family that they can call in an emergency needs to look inward and see why that is so. I don<APO>t believe that anyone who can afford to have a surgical procedure and all that it entails, can<APO>t put that money away towards a better life, if they believe that there is a better medical choice for them. Of course everyone has their own path to follow, but we do have free will, and can decide how to live our own lives. I can only honestly share what is true in my own experience. I am happy to make suggestions to anyone, but that is all it is, it is just a suggestion. Everyone makes their own life choices. I have empathy for everyone in pain, but I don<APO>t have pity for everyone. Take care, Annette""I know we all have our own paths to follow. Things are different for all of us. It sounds like at this point in time the best thing for you to do is pay down your mortgage, pay down your bills, and just try and hang on. At some point the economy will turn around, housing will again be worth more than it is now. Things will get better. I remember you recently telling me how impossible it would be for you to go to your daughter<APO>s wedding, how miserable you would be, how many of the people there would be related to your ex, they wouldn<APO>t be nice to you, you didn<APO>t have the right clothes, or shoes, etc. But you went, and you had a great time.No one cared about your shoes. Once it was over, you were glad you had gone. You pushed yourself beyond your comfort zone and you were successful. I discovered early on that I needed to do that most of the time. It has developed my own self confidence. I believe in you. Maybe more than you do. I believe we can all do more than we think we can. You are right, I did my homework when looking for doctors. I did that from my house on the telephone, I don<APO>t think I am so special that only I can do this. You say your doctor doesn<APO>t want to give you monthly RXs, but he still does. I always feel uncomfortable about asking for an increase in my meds, but I know that is just me feeling scared. I just don<APO>t blame it on anything but my own paranoia. Maybe you will luck out and your doctor will just keep giving you the RX every month for now. Tell him you are in debt for the other procedures and you can<APO>t afford it if you don<APO>t want to have it done. Tell him things might look better financially for you in six months or a year, and see if he will just wait... I don<APO>t claim to have answers for everyone, all I can do is make suggestions and share my own experiences. Mine have been good, I am not going to act like that is impossible, when I know it is possible in many cases. Nothing works for everyone. Someone else posted that you have to ""be a friend in order to have a friend."" She was upset that I had suggested that anyone who had no family and no friends should look inward. I agree with her, but I also feel we can be good friends whether or not we can go out to lunch or out shopping. You are a good friend here on the board. I doubt that your good qualities only shine here on the board. Hugs, Annette""I haven<APO>t used it, antidepressants do not agree with me. My hubby used it for a couple of years for pain control for AVN of his hip. After he had his hip replacement and no longer needed it, he went off of it in about three weeks with no withdrawal symptoms at all. He felt it was worth using. He had no side effects while he was on it. It was just part of a total pain management program. Take care, Annette""There is no place to get a ""free"" doctor<APO>s opinion, that would be like expecting a plumber to come fix your pipes for free. What have the doctors in Reno told you as far as the diagnosis and treatment plan go? It sounds to me like you are having tension headaches related to your neck pain, and possibly migraines on top of that if it goes too long. The meds they gave you sound like an appropriate starting plan. If it doesn<APO>t work, you call the doctor back and make an appt. to go see him again and try another type of meds. If they don<APO>t work, you go back again and try something different, until you find the combo that works for you. Twelve years ago, I lived in Reno for about ten years and had migraines and FMS and DDD all managed there by a local family practice doctor, and an occasional specialty consult. I used to work in the ER at the hospital in Sparks. There were plenty of good doctors there. Once I flew down to San Francisco to UCSF Medical Center for a neurology consult when I was having near daily headaches. He was great and gave my family doc a report with his recommendations. He actually didn<APO>t tell me anything different from what my Reno doctors said, but it felt good to know that he agreed with them as far as treatment methods. That is my hospital of choice for serious problems. Headaches are difficult to treat, it isn<APO>t like there is one pill that works for everyone. It took me a couple of years to find the right combination of meds. Take care, Annette""Stick to one doctor that you feel comfortable with. Continuity of care is very important if you want your doctor to really figure out what is going on with you. I found it took 3-4 visits to really know how I felt about a doctor. Take care, Annette""It sounds like your main problem is RA, for that you should be seeing a rheumatologist. He can also manage your FMS. There is a variety of meds that you can use for those illnesses, not just opiates. MS 15 mg. twice a day is a very small dose. Perhaps mixing that with other RA meds or adding the other meds and increasing the dose of morphine a bit would help. Take care, Annette""Cymbalta and Lyrica are not in the same class of drugs. Both are used to treat chronic pain, but from different angles. Cymbalta is an SNRI, an antidepressant also used for chronic pain. Lyrica is an antiseizure med, also used to treat chronic pain. Take care, Annette""No big deal. I thought you knew the difference, but was afraid a newcomer reading the post might get confused. Take care, Annette""I am not sure what a doctor could have done previously to prevent a bulging disc from herniating now? In my experience if one has a bulging disc one watches and waits and treats any symptoms. Even after a disc herniates, one still has choices about whether to have surgery or not unless there are severe functional deficits that can be attributed to the disc/spur problems. Before you have spinal surgery in your neck, you want to be sure your symptoms in your hands/forearms are caused by your DDD and not the carpal tunnel problem. As far as dismissing headaches as being caused by high B/P, one has only to treat the B/P and get it down to normal to see if the headaches subside. if they do, no worries, if they don<APO>t, then further exploration is needed. Same with the carpal tunnel syndrome, EMGs can often help a doctor differentiate between CTS and DDD in the cervical spine. There is no reason not to get an MRI of the lumbar region now that I am aware of. I have had MRIs of the lumbar spine along with having a diagnosed herniated disc of the cervical spine. The last MRI you had of your lower back was in 2006, may as well see what is going on there and plan how to cope with it. I do have FMS along with the DDD of my cervical spine. If you had a positive tender point test for FMS, and actually have FMS, it can really complicate coming up with a treatment plan for other pain producing problems. You could have surgery, and have NO relief of your pain at all, if the pain is actually from your FMS. I would see a neurologist and start there at trying to sort this all out. Take care, Annette""I recommend visiting the site www.myalgia.com for good medical info about FMS. There may not be any licensing for therapists who see mainly FMS patients, a lot of therapists do see mostly chronic pain patients, and some see a lot of FMS patients. The therapist I saw was very familiar with FMS and saw many patients who had this syndrome. I strongly recommend cognitive behavioral therapy. There is a self help book called, ""Feeling Good"", by Dr. David Burns, MD. I found it to be excellent. Also, ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"", By Dr. Margaret A. Caudil, PhD, MD. I used these two books on my own after I moved away from where my therapist worked. I was able to cure my depression completely. Take care, Annette""I do not know whether you have FMS or not. This is just to clarify specifics about FMS for those who are unaware of it. There is no test either for it, or to rule it out, bone scans don<APO>t show FMS and do not rule it out. Many people have FMS and also have other illnesses at the same time, especially OA and RA. FMS is diagnosed by examination and history. There are specific findings that lead a doctor to consider FMS as a diagnosis. Tests are done to rule other things out that could cause the same symptoms. To learn more about it, I recommend www.myalgia.com. Take care, Annette""I had a C6-7 discectomy on my cervical spine in 1992, and herniated another disc at C5-6 after that. I have opted not to have any surgery on that disc, it was diagnosed as herniated by MRI in 1993. I have multiple other bulging discs in my neck, osteophytes, impingement on my spinal cord from the herniated disc. All that was from my last MRI over 15 years ago. I did have an MRI of my lumbar spine about 10 years ago, it is normal. As far as I know, there is no medical treatment that will prevent a bulging disc from herniating at a later date. What treatment do you believe a neurologist could have done for you back in 2006 other than just treating your pain? What could have been done to prevent the herniation? I have DDD of my cervical spine, I never had any injury either. I developed FMS long after my spinal problems came along. Take care, Annette""You said in your first post on this thread that you had been diagnosed with FMS. Take care, Annette""I am assuming the PC you are talking about is your primary care doc??? Surgeons are not trained in managing chronic pain, only acute pain, so I am not surprised that he cut you off when you ceased to have a surgical option. Your primary care doc should cover you until you can get back in to see the pain management doctor. You are not on heavy duty meds at this point. If you taper off according to the surgeon<APO>s instructions, you may not have any withdrawal to speak of. That usually comes when someone stops suddenly, even then it is very individual. You mentioned they do not work much any more anyway. I would suggest you make appts. with both your primary care doc and the pain management doc. Tell both offices to put you in their cancellation lists so that if anyone cancels their appt. you will be moved up to their appt. I was told my husband would not be able to see a special surgeon for three months, and he got in in less than a week, because someone else canceled. It is hit and miss, no guarantees, but it is worth a shot. Meanwhile, I would see your primary care doc in person, and explain what is going on. I would suggest you either hold it together in front of your daughter, or find someone else to care for her during the difficult times. It isn<APO>t good for her to see you like that. You know that already, call a friend or family member. Take care, Annette""RSD is not in my area of expertise, so I did go look it up in my Merck Manual. I am happy to look things up for folks who don<APO>t have the books. Keep in mind that all people who write books don<APO>t always do good research. I think it is good to read a variety of things, but I lean toward medical texts since that is what I am familiar with. I would ask the doctor you are going to see on Monday directly about surgical sympathectomies in your case. Everyone is different, and I think the most important thing with most surgeries and other treatments is for the doctor to carefully match the patient with the procedure. I think this is where you really need to find a good doctor that you trust completely. Take care, and let me know how it goes. Hugs, Annette""I missed you!!! Glad to have you back. I hope your wife and you both recover quickly from the swine flu. The regular flu shots do not protect us from the swine flu. The regular flu shots are made up every year and must be repeated each year. Fortunately, the regular flu shots and the swine flu shots are made using dead virus material, so they CANNOT give us the flu. My hubby and I had our regular flu shots already, but there is a shortage of swine flu shots out here. We don<APO>t really fall into the emergency categories, although my husband has asthma, it is very mild. So I guess we will wait until more becomes available. Take good care of yourself and your dear wife. Hugs, Annette""I am pro vaccine. I would get it if it were available for everyone here, so far it is not. I am calling my hubby<APO>s doctor in the AM to see if they have any for him. DH and I talked about it last night, and decided if there were limited numbers of shots available, we would both rather it be given to children. The H1N1 flu seems to hit kids and pregnant women the hardest. I don<APO>t know where you got the number ""25,000 times the mercury"". I believe Thermisol (sp.?) was the mercury-based preservative that people were concerned about causing autism in children. Although all the medical studies done showed no relationship between this chemical and autism, it was long ago removed from most vaccines. I do not know if the flu vaccine or the H1N1 vaccine contains mercury or not, but I feel both are safe and have used the seasonal flu vaccine every year for a good 25 years, as have my hubby and son. They both skipped one year and both got the flu and were very sick, and never missed it again. I got the flu one year early in the season, before getting the flu shot, and got Tamiflu the first day I was sick, and was well within two or three days. I still got the flu shot when it came out that year. There are a variety of viruses that can cause flu symptoms, the flu shot covers three of them, I think. The virus in all kinds of flu is one that can mutate over time, so previous exposure or illness is not a guarantee from what I have heard. I doubt you would get the same virus again the same year you had it, but in the following years it might be possible. They do say that folks old enough to have had the swine flue the last time it went around seem to have at least a partial resistance to it. They seem to think that is why it is hitting small children and young adults more than older folks. I will get the vaccine, as soon as me getting it will not keep a younger person from getting access to it. Hopefully, soon. This is just my own opinion, we all have one. Everyone should have this discussion with their own doctor and make their own decision based on their own health and medical history. Take care, Annette""Sorry the PM doc was a jerk. The foot doctor actually sounds right on point with his theory. I have been there when the ER doctors did those blocks and did do minor procedures on toes, like removing the toe nail. The patient didn<APO>t feel a thing. It is too bad that it didn<APO>t help you, but at least now you know what you have and can stop looking. I hope your friend does okay in Afghanistan. Is he in the military? My son was in the Marines there during the initial invasion. It was pretty rough. Hopefully, the communications are better now. I didn<APO>t hear his voice or get an email the whole time he was in country. Just the occasional letter by snail mail. I bet you will be able to email, or even talk on the phone now. Hugs, Annette""Afghanistan was a breeze compared to the two deployments to Iraq. Then I truly felt he was there for no good reason, that was hard to bear, especially the last trip. He felt the main reason he was in Iraq was to bring his men home safely. He was the one with combat experience. I will hold good thoughts for your friend. He is brave to go over there, but the pay is good. That is why most civilians go. God knows the military doesn<APO>t pay enough to make it worthwhile. He should make sure he understands what kind of health coverage he gets in case anything goes wrong, and save the money he gets paid until he is safely home. My son knows former Marines who went back as civilians and had their money spent before they even got home. I think your friend is more mature than that though. Bless you both. Hugs, Annette""According to my Merck Manual they do still do surgical sympathectomies for RSD in selected patients. It is a much more invasive procedure, but it does seem to help some people. I would check with a surgeon who does this type of surgery and see what his success rate is. Take care, Annette""By ""adequate meds"" do you mean opiates? Is it possible that with things like gout, you should be laying down with your affected part elevated above your heart, rather than climbing and crawling, etc.? There are some conditions that that simply prevent us from doing certain kinds of work. Covering symptoms with certain kinds of meds may only cause our underlying condition to get worse. I do not know if this fits your condition or not. Take care, Annette""I am not familiar with Canada<APO>s way of working so I can<APO>t even guess how to expedite care there.. Please break up your posts into paragraphs in the future. Many of us find one long post too difficult to read and we may just skip over it. Take care, Annette""Cortisol levels are measured in urine collections over specific time periods, and also in blood tests to measure adrenal function with a drug given to suppress or stimulate the function as indicated. I have only read about the cortisol saliva test on alternative medicine websites where they are selling you the test. This does not fall within the realm of my expertise. Take care, Annette""I do not know about cortisol and how it affects your teeth. But, I do know that many of the meds we use for pain cause a dry mouth, and that leads to dental decay. Discuss your concerns with your dentist and doctor, and see what they say. I do agree with Gail that the best thing we can do about this is take really good care of the teeth we have. Some people use artificial saliva to combat the dry mouth, I don<APO>t know if that would be useful here or not. Take care, Annette""This is far away from my area of expertise, so I am just making suggestions for further research. Would the psoriatic arthritis have anything to do with the bad teeth? I know it affects primarily skin and nails, but teeth are made of the same cells as skin and nails from what I heard recently on a medical show. According to one book I have folks with this ailment can actually resorb the bones in the ends of their fingers. I have not experienced what you describe, sounds like we need to do more research. Take care, Annette""Thank you for the suggestion about the book, I will go and read it. It sounds vaguely familiar, but I am not positive I have read it before. You mentioned that you had set up dental care with a student, but it fell through. You might try again, my brother had all his dental care for years through a dental school, he felt he got great care. My best friend was a wartime child and she did not get the right nutrients as a fetus or young child. Her teeth all rotted when she was very young. She got both upper and lower dentures when she was about 20 years old. I never knew her before, when she had her own teeth. She has always been very happy with hers, and no longer has the constant dental pain she had before. She is about 65 now. She has had some bone loss recently, and said it was harder to fit the lower ones so they would stay in. She has never used any kind of dental adhesive. My hubby has an upper plate, he lost his upper teeth due to rotting out when he had chemotherapy. He lost several of the lower ones too, but so far has all the front ones and doesn<APO>t want to deal with a lower denture. They are more difficult to fit so you can wear them without adhesive. We lived together for nearly 20 years before I ever saw him without his denture is place. They took it out for surgery, and I saw him then for the first time. No big deal. Take good care of yourself, Gail. You are such a big help here. Hugs, Annette""I did go find Dr. Tennant<APO>s paper and reread it. I have read it before. I remembered it once I got started. Thanks for posting it. Hope you are feeling better. Hugs, Annette""The amount of SSDI $$ you get does not depend on how much information you give them about your illnesses. It is based on the amount of money you have earned in your lifetime and paid SSDI premiums on. It took me 14 months from initial filing of SSDI until I was approved at a judicial hearing. I strongly recommend you get a lawyer involved as early as possible. They know how to word things so that SS understands just what you can and cannot do. You need your doctors to support you in the claim for SSDI. It is only approved for people who are unable to do any kind of work in the country that nets you a certain amount of money per month. That amount changes from year to year. You can find all that info at ssa.gov. Take care, Annette""But it will change. Contact he human resources dept. at your job and ask them what you can do about health insurance. The government will pay a percentage of your COBRA, but you will have to pay part of it to maintain coverage. See a doctor about your depression before you lose coverage. Call 911 or your doctor if you seriously consider hurting yourself. Call your state dept. of disability and vocational rehabilitation to see what you may be eligible for as far as re-education or re-training for a different job. They were a great help to me when I could no longer work as an RN in the ER. Yes, for me the depression did pass. I got on disability when I could no longer do any kind of work. But, that takes time, up to two years on average. If you have long term or short term disability at your job, apply for it as soon as you might be eligible. Your human resource dept. should be able to help you with that. Take care, Annette""Tramadol does not even come in 25 mg. tablets, so it sounds to me like your ""safety manager"" doesn<APO>t really know what he is talking about. Go to someone higher up the food chain and ask again. There are some jobs that include licensing requirements that preclude opiate use along with other meds for things like seizures, and diabetes. Zero tolerance drug policies often refer to illegally obtained drugs, not prescription meds given by your doctor. I worked in a hospital that did drug screens for various employers, and as long as the person had a legal RX for a drug, it was not a problem. The only job there that was different was for truck drivers with commercial licenses. Short acting opiates only give a response for 4-6 hours, so even if they showed in your urine test, they would not be affecting your behavior in the morning if you took one when you got home from work, in the evening, or on weekends. They will show up in your urine for up to three days, but it is not illegal to take them on your time off if prescribed for you. Back when I was working as a nurse, I had a positive drug screen for a short acting drug that was legally prescribed and they did not fire me. I took it after work and never less than 8 hours before coming to work. Back then, they felt the same way about nurses taking opiates, I just assumed that I could not take the long acting kind and work in a hospital. Nowadays, it is completely different. The state board of nursing in most states leave it up to the nurse, and her employer. They decided that working in pain is more distracting and likelier to cause mistakes than a nurse on well managed opiate therapy. If you have a state or federal license, check with your licensing organization. Otherwise check with your human resource dept. at work and get more information. Take care, Annette""I am so glad to hear you are finding some relief. I hear you about sleeping. The days that I get a decent amount of sleep are SO different from the ones where I have not slept well. I really believe that sleep is a very important component of our care and is often overlooked. Take care, Annette""Fibromyalgia is the correct term. Fibrosis is something else entirely. Rheumatologists are the specialists who treat FMS. In the old days they thought it was a rheumatic problem, and so they got the FMS patients. Now some believe it is a neurological problem, but no one believes it is a rheumatic problem. But, rheumatologists still are the official specialists for FMS. I have worked with rheumys, neurologists and pcps who were all very good at managing FMS. Take care, Annette""Migraines can be so hard to manage, I was lucky and my pcp managed all my meds, so only one doctor was making medicine decisions for me. I did have a consult with neurologists, including one at UCSF Medical Center in San Francisco. They would check out my scans, and previous history and write a report for my pcp. He would read them with me and we would decide what to do next. There are literally dozens of preventative meds for migraines, we went through the different kinds one at a time, then they try two at a time. I kept journals for years. I would find a med that worked and then after a year or two, it would stop working. Then I had to cycle through them again until I found the right one. Rescue meds for migraines are nearly as difficult. I did the same kind of experimentation until I found what worked for me. I learned early on to stay away from opiates for my migraines. I went online and talked to my pharmacist and found all kinds of studies from all over the world. When I found something that seemed worthwhile, I would print it out and show it to my doctor. Menopause was a good thing for me, my migraines decreased in frequency and severity. I started using neurontin about that time, so I am never sure which it was. I take the neurontin for something else, and am not willing to stop it to see if it is what helps my migraines. I wish there was a magic pill that everyone with migraines could take, but there isn<APO>t. You just have to keep trying the different things until you find what works for you. I had cervical spine surgery in 1992, it made no difference in my migraines at all. Some people have improvement in headaches after neck surgery, but many don<APO>t. Take care, Annette""You need to see your doctor and get evaluated so you know what you are dealing with. Meanwhile, unless you have a visual problem or some other reason to use all capitol letters, please don<APO>t. It is often interpreted as you yelling at us if you use all CAPs. It is also hard for many of us to read. Take care, Annette""Go to the ssa.gov site and get the info you need there. It is very user friendly. They don<APO>t do percentages of disability for SSDI like they do for the military, it is pretty black and white. They either say you are disabled or not. But you need to keep going through the appeals processes, most people are turned down at the beginning, and many are approved at a later stage. Get a lawyer. Take care, Annette""I feel your pain also. I wish I had some kind of answer for you. As you have read in the posts before mine, many people live in chronic pain. It sounds like you have tried everything else, now try the opiates. None of us ever thought we would need daily opiates to keep going. My best friend at work, (we were RNs in an ER), told me when I stopped working, ""Now you can take your pain meds the way you teach your patients to take them and they might even work."" She was right, at that time I was using short acting opiates and only taking them when the pain was really, really bad. Wrong! I am on SSDI and now I use my pain meds wisely and they work better. Am I living the life I thought I would be living? NO! But, I am living and I am happy most of the time. I am not paralyzed. I strongly recommend volunteer work for everyone, but especially for those who are forced to stop working and miss it. I know what you mean by missing your patients. I have volunteered since I stopped working in 1997-8 at various places. Take care, hope to see you again. Hugs, Annette""I agree, it is time to see an MD. Chiros can only do so much, and I would never let a chiro adjust my neck. I have a nurse friend who had a stroke due to a neck adjustment, the ambulance picked her up at the chiro<APO>s office. She was paralyzed on one side, but fully recovered after about three years. At this stage of the game a scan is probably a reasonable choice. They give more information than xrays do. It has only been two months, you didn<APO>t have any traumatic injury, this may well go away in a few more months. Don<APO>t cross bridges before you get to them. My mom always said that, and she gave good advice. I hope you don<APO>t have chronic pain that lasts your whole life, it is far too soon to be worrying about that. See what the doctor says. Take care, Annette""Yesterday I posted a reply to Rick<APO>s concern about the H1N1 flu shots that he had heard contain mercury. I said I did not know if it contained Thimerosal or not. I did some research this AM and found that it is available with or without Thimerosal. This ingredient is used in multiple dose vials to preserve the sterility of the vaccine. There are brands of H1N1 vaccine available in single dose vials that do not contain this. So if you are concerned about this ingredient, you can still get the vaccine, just choose accordingly. Take care, Annette""My doctor told me it only helps if your body is low on B12 anyway, same with Vit. D. She ran my blood for these two vitamins and my B12 was normal and my D was a tiny bit low, so I am now taking Vit. D. I have FMS, and had pain behind my knees that she thought might be related to a vit. deficiency. There has been no difference for me since starting the vit. D, or after starting the prenatal vits. that I take. I have taken a prenatal vit for many years, it contains a vit B complex, that just means it has several different vit. Bs in it, in addition to the other vits. in it. My doctor feels that the balance of Bs in it is good for all women. Take care, Annette""This is a question for his doctor. Write down all the questions you two have and take a pad and pen with you so you can write down the answers, you will for get them otherwise, too much stress in this kind of situation. The surgeon will need to know all the meds he takes, RX and non-RX, and herbal or supplements. Take care, Annette""I do not know what his surgeon does. I have read that some surgeons want their patients off of opiates before surgery, and others who don<APO>t. I personally do not see the point of being miserable, but I have not gone through this nor had a friend or family member go through it. At the point where the surgeon tells the two of you what he would like to do, you are not bound to go forward. You should hear him out, get a second opinion from another unrelated surgeon, the two of you talk it over, then make the appt. for surgery if you decide to go forward. My husband saw at least four different surgeons before deciding on the surgeon who replaced his hip. Take care, Annette""Congratulations on stopping the alcohol, that is a tough battle. It sounds like they have gone down the right path so far. I would see a neurologist next. Perhaps have an EMG if he feels it is appropriate. Take care, Annette""If I had an injection that lasted 3 months, I would just repeat it if possible. What is the maximum number of these injections that you can have per year? Itching from opioids is not necessarily a sign of an allergic reaction, it is a common side effect of opioids and often goes away completely after a few months. If you have no hives or difficulty breathing it is unlikely to be an allergic reaction. You are lucky to already have a daughter, I would want to get my pain under control prior to being pregnant again. Discuss with your OB doctor what meds he would okay during pregnancy to see in advance if they would likely work for you. See a good therapist with experience with chronic pain patients to get past the sadness and depression. They really do help. Take care, Annette""If taking steroids orally works as well as the injections do, then just go with that. I used to take oral steroids for a couple of weeks, three or four times a year for a spinal problem. It worked fairly well as far as the pain went. The down side is that the steroids go all through your body that way. With the injections, they stay close to the area where they are injected. Please don<APO>t try to get pregnant close to the steroid treatment without talking it over with your OB doctor first. If she hasn<APO>t dealt with high risk pregnancies like yours, then you should ask for a referral to someone who has. With some kinds of medicines, you need to wait for a period of time to get pregnant to allow your body to wash the drugs out of your body. The OB doctor should be able to tell you how long to wait to get pregnant if it is necessary. It isn<APO>t right to sacrifice time with one child that is already here, in order to satisfy one<APO>s desire to have another baby. If you are crying all day now, how will you care for two kids? Deal with your problems before you get pregnant again. get all your ducks in a row. Everyone has hardships in their own lives that they do not share with everyone they know. What is ""normal"" anyway? Take care, Annette""Sorry to hear about your cat. Since the cat goes outside, it is hard to tell if she was hit by a car, got in a fight, or the eye just ruptured due to the old infection. I suggest you start keeping her indoors, with a litter box. Indoor cats live much longer and healthier lives than cats that are allowed to roam outdoors. Sorry you are having so much pain, I hope things settle down for you and your meds work. Take care, Annette""I had deQuervain<APO>s tendinitis years ago. They did rest with a splint, cortisone injections, then he finally did surgery. I wished he had just done that first, lol. It took him 7 minutes from when he did the incision until the last suture was placed. He did it with just a local anesthetic, I stayed awake and unmedicated so I could watch. I had near immediate pain relief. All I have left is a scar that most people would not even notice, he did a great job on that. I can<APO>t help with your other problems, but the deQuervain<APO>s is usually nothing to worry about. If you also have RSD, then you need to be careful with any kind of surgery, discuss this with a doctor who manages RSD. Take care, Annette""If you are taking more vicodin than your prescription allows, call your doctor and make an appt. and go see him. He should be able to tell you if it is safe to take more vicodin between now and when he can see you. Don<APO>t take any more than is prescribed, or you may not get any more after this. Take care, Annette""You need to be seen by a doctor and evaluated. Then he/she can tell you what to do next. Don<APO>t try and get professional information from ""people"" or on the net, see a professional. Once you get a diagnosis, there may be other people here who have had the same thing and can offer advice. Take care, Annette""I believe in trying to work with a doctor. But, at this point in your care, I would tell him the meds he gives you aren<APO>t working and if he can<APO>t help you, you would like a referral to a doctor who specializes in back pain that may be able to help you. You might take a friend or family member with you to your next appt. Have them take notes. Sometimes that pushes a doctor into doing more than he would if it were just you and he. You say he gives you an muscle relaxant in your butt, I assume you mean an injection of some kind. Do you know what it is he is giving you? Does it help at all? For how long? Take care, Annette""What kinds of symptoms do you have in your sleep when you refer to withdrawal? Be very specific? Take care, Annette""Don<APO>t ask for a specific drug, just tell him that you can no longer afford the patches, that they don<APO>t work well for you anyway, and could he recommend a different long acting opiate instead. I don<APO>t know how w/c works in your state, here if one was already on meds for a pre-existing condition, w/c would not pay for them, or allow their doctor to deal with other issues than the work related injury. It makes it very complicated if one has more than one pain condition, and not all were caused by the work related injury. Good luck. Take care, Annette""The on line tool I use says that 4.5 mg. of hydrocodone is equianalgesic to 30 mg. of codeine. That means they have the same analgesic effect for someone in pain at those doses. That does not mean that one switches from 30 mg. of codeine to 4.5 mg. of hydrocodone if one has been taking the codeine regularly. There is only a partial cross tolerance with different opiates, so the doctor should start at about half of the equianalgesic dose and adjust the dose as needed beyond that. Otherwise one can overdose on the new drug. If you are playing with illegal drugs and just want to know how much to party with, please don<APO>t do that. It is dangerous. Take care, Annette""Fentanyl does come in lollypops and lozenges that are absorbed by the mucous membrane between your gums and your cheek. But there are only good for breakthrough pain, and last a short time only. The patch is a long acting delivery system. If it isn<APO>t right for someone, they would usually go to one of the long acting opioids taken orally next. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t even know that the patch is what made you sick last time. It might have been the increase in the fentanyl, or it might have been some brief illness. If you increase the patch again, you may feel ill again, I don<APO>t know and the only way to find out is to give it a try. Ask the doctor for some kind of meds to use for nausea, just in case. Opiates frequently cause nausea, so if it happens you will be ready. Those kinds of symptoms usually go away in a few days. Plan your increase for a time in your life when you don<APO>t need to drive the car, and have someone there with you to help if you need it. Anyhow, now you are back on the 25 mcg./hour patch and say you go into withdrawal after 40 hours, what exactly are the symptoms you are having? How could the doctor help you, other than prescribing the patch more frequently, which he probably won<APO>t do? I have found that treating specific symptoms often works. Talk to your doctor, tell him what you have shared with us. Take care, Annette""Many people ascribe any feelings they get to withdrawal. I asked because you could be getting something else, or the doctor might be able to treat you symptomatically. You can treat symptoms of opiate withdrawal with non-opiate meds if necessary. I just asked to get an idea what you were experiencing. I think Teresa<APO>s suggestion of increasing your meds by 12 mcg./hour is one choice. But knowing how the fentanyl patch delivery system works and if you are going through withdrawals at 40 hours, I am not sure that increasing the hourly dose would change that. Wouldn<APO>t you still run out at 40 hours? You might ask the doctor if you are going to apply a second patch, if you could apply it the day after you put on the first patch, so they overlap. It defeats the purpose of only having to change your patch every 2 days, but that is up to you and your doctor, and it might work. If the patch doesn<APO>t work well for you, maybe try an oral med? I take other oral long acting and short acting opiates for pain management, so I do know how upsetting withdrawal symptoms can be. Opiate withdrawal is opiate withdrawal, the symptoms are all the same. I hope you figure something out soon. Take care, Annette""I<APO>ve been posting here for well over ten years and many people have posted here that the patches do last 72 hours for them, just like the long acting oral meds last 12 hours for many of us, they don<APO>t have to be taken every 8 hours to work. It varies from person to person. You are the only person I have heard of that changes their patches daily, but you don<APO>t do it because of the medication delivery, it sounds like you do it because the adhesive bothers your skin??? In my experience changing the patch every 36 hours would be unusual. I believe that if the patch doesn<APO>t work after 40 hours, and this poor person goes into withdrawal every 40 hours for a whole day, then it might be best to try something different. Just my opinion. We all have them. Obviously, the best thing for anyone to do is have a frank and open discussion with their doctor. Take care, Annette""If you are passing blood in your urine, you need to go see a urologist to discover the source. The last time it happened, did the doctor finally say your urine was clear of blood cells completely, and tell you that you didn<APO>t need to come back again? Or did the urine look clear to you, so you quit going? You can have blood in your urine even when it looks clear to the naked eye. They have to look at it under the microscope to be certain it has cleared up. Unfortunately, one bad source of blood in the urine is cancer of the bladder. If you have ever been a smoker this would increase your odds of having cancer. There are also much simpler causes. The only way to know is to go see your doctor, then a urologist is necessary. Take care, Annette""I<APO>m afraid I know exactly the kind of torture test they do for this. They do the same one for women. A good friend of mine had bladder cancer that was treated successfully with surgery, radiation and chemo. A tough combo, but she came through it fine, no ostomy bag or anything like that. This is one of those things that scares all of us, at least those of us with brains, lol. It is too easy to write it off rather than go to the specialist and get the torture test. Please follow up with the urologist as soon as you can. Take care, Annette""I will think good thoughts for you. Let me know how things go on Thursday. Hugs, Annette""I would just be honest and tell him the patches don<APO>t work that well and are too expensive. Ask if you could try an oral medication instead. I wouldn<APO>t ask for specific drugs by name. I don<APO>t know what happens after a year on w/c in your state, I would find out now though, and not leave it until the last minute. Do you get a $$ settlement at that point if you continue to be disabled? Take care, Annette""I have had migraines for 25 years now, I have not read anything about a vit. D deficiency triggering migraines. You could have your doctor draw your blood and test it during cloudy days to see if the vit. D level is low, or just take a supplement and see if it makes any difference. Take care, Annette""Chronic pain is different than migraines. I don<APO>t think Vit D levels change much from day to day, but seasonally those of us who live up north may not get enough sunshine in the winter months, so ones Vit. D level may drop. My level has dipped down this winter slightly below normal, and it has never been low before. I started taking supplements per my doctor, but have not noticed any difference with my pain. It was just as bad back when my Vit. D level was normal. Barometric changes can affect migraines and other kinds of chronic pain also. Take care, Annette""Lots of universities and graduate programs have counseling available on a sliding scale or for free for folks who need it and can<APO>t afford it. If you feel like hurting yourself or killing yourself, please call your doctor, a crisis line, or go directly to the ER for help. I have found volunteer work to be a great help in finding something productive to do. Call around your community and see what is available. Most places there is everything from a weekly commitment to occasional events that need help. Schools and libraries need people to just read to kids or help them with their reading. Adult literacy programs are in most communities, they train you, you don<APO>t have to be a teacher. A friend of mine hands out programs and ushers at a local place where they have concerts, comics, plays, etc. She gets in for free, meets some new people, gets some distraction from her own medical problems. I have volunteered at Camp Fire Girls, libraries, clinics, the animal shelter. I love it. There are also two books I would recommend, ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns, MD and ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"", by Dr. Margaret A. Caudil, MD, PhD. Both have really helped me over the years with all the adjustments that come with chronic pain. Take care, Annette""Medicare comes in several parts. Part A (covers hospitalization) comes free with your SSDI. To get Part B (covers doctors, labs, other out patient stuff) or Part D (covers meds) you have to apply and pay your premiums. When I had Part B, the premium was deducted from my SSDI check, but I had to write a check every month for the Part D. Nothing happens automatically, it is a complicated and confusing process. It is shocking to those who don<APO>t know, but many of us on SSDI are not eligible for any kind of state or county assistance. I<APO>m not. Even without my husband<APO>s income my SSDI check puts me enough over the poverty level that I do not qualify for anything else. Medicare sends out a handbook every year that explains just how to use it, even if all you have is Part A, you should have received this handbook in the mail already for 2010. Many pain management clinics have counselors connected with them. Take care, Annette""Everything sounds miserable, but the B/P sounds the scariest. If the inderal is bringing the blood pressure down to 137/58, that is a good thing. How often are you to be taking the inderal? Is it the short acting inderal or the sustained release kind that you only take once a day? 10 mg. is a very small dose, but usually it is gradually increased until you get the control you are looking for. Sometimes doctors like to get the patient started on the immediate, short acting inderal and once they find the daily dose that works they switch it over to the once a day kind. Don<APO>t fire one doctor until you have found a replacement. I understand being angry, but don<APO>t let it hurt you. Has your endocrinologist committed to controlling your B/P in addition to your thyroid and female issues? Take care, Annette""The reason I asked is because usually the internist handles B/P. Lots of endocrinologists choose to only manage thyroid problems rather than the whole picture. This is just my preference, but I opt to have an internist for my pcp. She writes ALL my RXs. When I have seen a specialist, they sent reports to my pcp, and she and I sat down and decided what med changes to make. I prefer the safety of having one doctor write all my RXs, to the convenience of letting everyone write what they want. Even though I am an old nurse, and have a great pharmacist, I would worry about having drug interactions from different doctors writing my RXs. An internist is the doctor who usually takes care of total adult patient. They don<APO>t do kids at all. I have also had a Family Practice Doctor as a pcp and we handled things the same way. With all the risk factors you have, you should be on a life style program to prevent heart disease. A diet to bring down your cholesterol and B/P, etc. Do you have a pcp in addition to this endocrinologist? Is this guy into managing anything besides your thyroid problems? If I were you, I guess I would take the reins a bit more, and write down a list of your concerns, if he doesn<APO>t have time to address them in one appt. then tell him you have more and will make a second appt. if necessary. Stick to your list, write down his response to each concern. Take a friend to support you and take notes of the appt. for you if possible. By focusing on your list, you may be able to be more businesslike. Best of luck. Take care, Annette""I would make an appt. with your internist and explain all this to him/her. Tell him/her that you want one person to oversee all your meds. Let him know that you are very concerned about your B/P and the sweating issue. I am confused about your B/P meds, first you said you were on Inderal (propranolol), now you say the endocrinologist gave you Lisinopril without giving the metroprolol (?) a try. Where did the metroprolol come from? If the sweating is caused by your thyroid problems, then probably getting that sorted out would be the best thing to stop the sweating. You have multiple medical problems and I would have an internist co-ordinate things for me if I were in your situation. Take care, Annette""I would just stick with one doctor, your internist, for your B/P meds. Ask him how long it should take to get a result from the B/P meds. Usually it is not nearly as long as it takes with antidepressants. Getting your B/P down would be my first concern. Do you have a pain management doctor? If not who manages your pain? Talk to that doctor about better pain control. Take care, Annette""Because you decreased the norco to half tabs first, then replaced the norco with an extra fentanyl patch, I would wonder if you had opiate withdrawals. It just doesn<APO>t seem that withdrawals from that amount of medicine would be so severe. I take a long acting morphine on a twice a day schedule and Norco as needed for breakthrough pain (up to 5-6 a day). Just recently, I had a day when I didn<APO>t take ANY Norco at all (good pain day) and I had no withdrawal symptoms at all. Unfortunately, it was just a good day, and I only had the one. But, the following day I wasn<APO>t in worse pain than usual, or sick in any way. Did you have a fever, diarrhea, yawning, tearing of the eyes, runny nose, goosebumps, or a cough? Did you have acute anxiety, insomnia or other emotional symptoms? Overheating until you STOP sweating is when heat stroke starts, but heat sickness comes first. That coupled with dehydration could also explain most of your symptoms. I took care of a young woman once in an ICU near Yosemite in Calif., she died from heat stroke. It can be very serious. Discuss it with your doctor. Get a lock for your suitcase or a briefcase that locks. I can<APO>t imagine traveling without a secure place for my meds. I have a small luggage lock on one suitcase for when I arrive at my destination. I carry all my meds in their original bottles in my carry on when I fly. Take care, Annette""One can have low back pain and/or sciatica and have no positive tests. What helps the pain when she does get it? Does she take any medicine for it? Has she tried heat or ice? Massage? Has she had any injections? It might be time to just see a pain management doctor to control the symptoms, you may not find the direct cause of her pain. Take care, Annette""I understand your frustration about not having a definite diagnosis. However, sometimes people have pain for no diagnosable reason. She still needs pain management. It sounds like you have done the usual things one would do on their own. Has she seen a pain management specialist for more aggressive prescription medicine treatment? I am big on foot rubs from my husband. My feet don<APO>t hurt, but like you say it distracts my brain from the other pain and totally relaxes me. I am not big on injections and invasive procedures, I question how well they really work. Charles has a link to some research, he might post it for you. Take care, Annette""This is just information that I have learned over the years. Fibrosis is the fiber-like connective tissue that can grow with scar tissue. This is not just me, it is out of my medical dictionary. Fibromyalgia used to be called fibrositis, but now they have learned that FMS is not an inflammatory process, so they changed the name accordingly. FMS causes widespread musculoskeletal pain and fatigue as predominant symptoms. Why don<APO>t you just type in FMS, that is shorter still and people will know what you mean? It makes it difficult for me if you use inaccurate abbreviations for illnesses, because then I don<APO>t know what you are talking about. Because they have learned that FMS does not cause inflammation at all, I don<APO>t necessarily buy into your theories about FMS flare ups and your response to them. I don<APO>t believe that the FMS flare causes inflammation to your brain and that causes your emotional outbursts. Excess pain might cause them, but not the FMS itself. I have never heard of OA causing any kind of brain inflammation either. I went and read the section on OA in my Merck Manual just to refresh my memory. It does not mention it either. With any kind of chronic pain, it is important to learn to pace yourself. It sounds like you did way to much at once yesterday, and that caused you a lot of pain today. Is Ultram the drug you mentioned as Aultram? If so, did your doctor tell you to take 400 mg. at one time? My drug book says that 100 mg is the maximum safe dose at one time, and a total of 400 mg. a day is the maximum total daily dose. Whether the doctor told you to take 400 mg. at one time or you just needed that much to get relief, it is probably time to tell him that maybe it is time to try something that works better. How you think and respond to what you think about can definitely alter your pain experience. Cognitive behavioural therapy teaches us how to stop negative thoughts and change our reaction to things around us, including our own chronic pain. I studied these techniques years ago and they work well for me. You can learn to control how you react to the pain signals your body sends your brain. It is the perception of those signals in the brain that makes up the experience of pain. Rather than having violent, emotional outbursts that increase your stress levels you can learn how to manage your pain more effectively. CBT techniques are just part of the total pain management program that might help you. Do you have leukemia now? FMS does not cause leukemia. FMS is not an inflammatory process. Please go read at www.myalgia.com. There is lots of good medical information there about FMS. Maybe reading it will help you understand how FMS works. Take care, Annette""Since you take 30 mg. of MS Contin every 12 hours, one suggestion might be to only increase the evening dose by 50%, that might be enough pain relief to get you through the night. Taking BT meds when you go to bed doesn<APO>t usually work for this because they wear off in the middle of the night, and you develop more pain that wakes you up to take another dose. I am a fan of increasing pain meds very slowly and carefully. I will be on them for the foreseeable future so I want to stay at the lowest dose possible. If your legs bother you at night due to RLS or something other than your usual pain, I would explore that with your doctor, it may be that there is another medicine more appropriate than an increase in morphine. Whatever you think, discuss it with your doctor. Take care, Annette""If you have read my posts very often, you will know that I don<APO>t really think it is safe to have multiple doctors writing RXs for you. Many sleep aids are also controlled substances, have you signed a contract with your PM doc to only get controlled substances from him? Keep that in mind. Don<APO>t break any rules, or you could get booted out of his practice. That said, Teresa mentioned several of the anti-depressants used for chronic pain management. The oldest one, amitriptyline, is often taken in the evening or at bedtime, and has a side effect of causing sleep. Something like that might be a good place to start, in that it may help your pain levels and help you sleep. The others she mentioned aren<APO>t as likely to help you sleep. Take care, Annette""Vistaril is not related to benzos at all, so it would not be related to lorazepam. It is an older drug, and I have seen it prescribed for anxiety many time with good effect. Take it on a night when you don<APO>t have to get up early the next day, so if you feel groggy you won<APO>t be driving. Talk to your doctor about the klonopin, if it is no longer working well for you, maybe it is time to try something else. Maybe with the vistaril you won<APO>t need it any more. By ""razadon"", do you mean trazedone? I took it many years ago and I also had side effects that would not work for me. I stopped using it. Talk to your pcp about all these different drugs. Take care, Annette""A fissure is a small crack. An ulcer on its own is serious in a diabetic, especially over an old amputation site. What is the podiatrist doing for the foot? Is he also seeing his regular doc to get his blood sugars under control? The foot won<APO>t heal if his sugars are out of whack. If he doesn<APO>t get things under control, he is probably looking at serial amputations as they try to save as much of his leg as they can. He may need regular wound care at a wound care clinic. Is there any infection in the ulcer? Any dead tissue? There are also regular diabetes classes to teach people how to care for themselves to avoid complications like ulcers. If he took one before, he may not have been ready to absorb the information, perhaps he is ready now. For those who don<APO>t know a fasting blood sugar is normally about 70-110, any fasting blood sugar greater than 125 is considered a diabetic level. 402 is way, way too high. Take good care of yourself, Lori, he may need you to care for him soon. Hugs, Annette""I am so sorry about your husband<APO>s attitude about his diabetes. You can<APO>t force him to do better, he has to decide that is what he chooses to do. Would leaving change his behavior? Would it shock him enough to take better care of himself in an effort to get you back? It would keep you from having to watch him be sick all the time, and die. That kind of frustration when you know he has a treatable disease can only make your own illness more difficult. It would be a hard decision to make. I agree that when we get married we vow to stick together for better or worse. It seems to me that when we promise to love, honor, protect, cherish, etc. that somewhere in there we are promising not to bring down hardship on those we love. When someone chooses not to take care of themselves physically, they are not respecting their spouse, let alone cherishing them. Is he eligible for Medicare, medicaid? Being without insurance in this country with a chronic illness like diabetes is horrible. Hugs, Annette""It sounds like you finally found a good doctor. I am glad he will manage your pain while you follow through on the rest of the diagnostic work. I think the muscle biopsy will be key to determining what kind of myositis you might have. It also sounds like a good beginning medicine plan for arthritis and myositis. Take care, Annette""I<APO>ve never had a pain pump, but I have heard of them sometimes being implanted in the back instead of the abdomen. Not sure why, just a vague memory of something I read. I do not see how putting the pump in your back would have caused the infection???? Infection is just a natural adverse effect that is possible with all surgeries. Didn<APO>t the original surgeon tell you that the most common adverse effect after surgery is infection? The good news is, I don<APO>t think that just because you had MRSA (methicillin resistant Staph Aureus) once, that you have to deal with it for the rest of your life. Did the antibiotic regimen through the PICC line work? If it did, the MRSA should be gone. My husband had a chronic penicillin resistant Staph infection in a non-healing wound for two years. He had multiple courses of oral antibiotics, and also had a Groshong catheter in his chest and went through a six week course of IV antibiotics like you did. He ended up having vascular surgery and the removal a damaged vein from under the wound, then it all healed up. Six months later he had his opposite hip replaced, and that has been over a year ago. He works as a big truck mechanic and occasionally cuts himself, it always heals right up with no sign of infection. That is why he had the Groshong catheter put in his chest, he didn<APO>t want a PICC line to inhibit his working, and he refused to stop working for long. His hip surgeon and infectious disease doctor both told him once the infection was gone entirely for 3-4 months, he had no more likelihood of getting another infection than anyone else. I would talk to another pain management surgeon who implants a lot of these devices, and ask him how often infections happen, then find out how often your surgeon<APO>s patients get infected. Compare the two numbers, if your surgeon is WAY ahead and gets lots more infections in his patients, I would think about that. Take care, Annette""It sounds like the surgeon is suggesting an implanted pain medicine pump. The body of the pump is usually implanted in the abdomen, with a small tube (catheter) that goes through the body and is implanted so the medicine drips into the intrathecal space of the spine. Using morphine this way allows the doctors to give you a much smaller dose per day than when you take it orally. The pump is battery operated and delivers a steady amount of the drug. The pump is filled periodically with the medicine your doctor orders, by injecting it through the skin and into the reservoir of the pump. The dose can be adjusted by the doctor with a special gadget held over the skin of the abdomen above the pump. Your hubby does not have a push button, lol, it is different than IV pumps used in the hospital. Contrary to what his surgeon told you, it does not always end with the patient taking no more pills. It may cut down the amount of oral meds one uses, but many people post here that they continue to take oral meds as well. There are other possible side effects, infections, leakage, scarring, catheter becoming dislodged, etc. I would discuss this with your husband<APO>s pain management doctor. Any kind of surgical intervention for pain management should be a last ditch treatment when every thing else has failed. One problem that I never thought of until someone posted it here was the loss of the financial ability to continue with the filling of the pump, etc. after the pump is in place. She had lost her insurance, and could no longer use the pump because she could no longer afford to have the medicine put in it, and could not afford to have it removed. I have never had a pump myself, so I have no personal experiences to share. Take care, Annette""Correct me if I am wrong...math isn<APO>t my forte. 35 Advil per week comes out to 5 per day. 35 (total tablets per week), divided by 7 (days per week), equals 5 (tablets per day). I may be totally brain fogged out, but 5 Advil per day is not enough to kill anyone or ruin ones kidneys. Advil is the brand name for ibuprofen, 200 mg. over the counter. Five Advil would equal 1,000 mg. of ibuprofen. The maximum dose of ibuprofen according to my drug handbook is 3,200 mg. per day. Of course, this would be with your doctor<APO>s supervision. I took 800 mg. of ibuprofen three times a day, under a doctor<APO>s supervision of course. I did that for several years. I assume this person is seeing a doctor, since she has had all these tests done, and that he is supervising her care plan, including her meds. I read only one positive diagnosis, a urologist said she had a birth defect on one ureter and that caused her pain? Perhaps getting a second opinion from another urologist would be useful. Take care, Annette""When you switch over to another long acting opiate, the doctor can use an online or written tool that explains how to switch over, dose wise. It gives the equivalent doses for different drugs. You should not have to go through withdrawal from one first. Although if you do get off of the methadone first, your tolerance level will be lower, actually it will be back to normal. That way you can use a lower dose of the fentanyl patch. I would imagine this is a choice you should b able to discuss with the doctor. I would be interested in any links to research that you have about pain management issues. Take care, Annette""If you have RA, I would change over to seeing a rheumatologist. There are actually specific meds for RA that might work better for you than all those injections you have had. If possible take your husband or a friend with you to your appts. at first. Having someone else present seems to make a lot of doctors behave better. Sad, but true. It may be that the PM clinic you are going to is one that does mainly interventions: injections and procedures. That is what they do, they really don<APO>t manage pain with oral meds, other than as a stop gap measure until they schedule an injection. They are called ""interventionists"". There is another type of PM clinic that does use oral meds and other non-invasive methods in addition to more invasive interventions. If a rheumy can<APO>t help you with your pain, I would suggest you find a PM clinic that does both interventionist care and non-interventionist care. I have a dear friend with RA, she is close to my age, 59, and has managed to continue working and caring for her son, and although she has had rough times, she is strong and happy. She was diagnosed with RA when she was younger than you. Start doing your research right away about RA, and learn how to deal with it. ""Arthritis Today"" is a great magazine put out by the Arthritis Foundation, I have subscribed to it for many years. It is the best $20/year investment in health that I have ever made. Take care, Annette""Teresa is right, you need to see an internist or a pain management specialist for chronic pain. Surgeons aren<APO>t trained to manage chronic pain, just the immediate pain after surgery. I am not sure why you were in bed for ten days, that really just makes back pain worse. It is usually better to get up and move around. Just my way of doing things, but I never call my doctor<APO>s office to discuss my pain, I call and make an appt. and go see her in person. Dealing with someone face to face is far better for your own health than playing telephone tag and talking to other people, and getting messages through other people. A surgeon does not have an ethical or legal obligation to keep seeing you beyond the post op period after surgery. I would concentrate on getting better. Take care, Annette""Since the doctors suspect two inflammatory diseases as possibly causing your pain, have they given you any anti-inflammatory drugs? They may actually work better than the opiates if they decrease the inflammation. Many people take both an opiate and an anti-inflammatory. There are also other pain management meds you can take in non-opiate families that are often used along with opiates. Things like antidepressants, antiseizure meds, and muscle relaxants. Don<APO>t start on any additional over the counter meds without discussing it with your doctor first. Take care, Annette""Using anti-inflammatories on a regular basis is different than using them for acute pain. The dose may be different, and it should be taken on a set schedule, not as needed. When my neck pain from DDD would flare up, I would take a two week run of prednisone to calm it down, and start ibuprofen 800 mg. three times a day, and stick to it. Usually once the prednisone calmed the inflammation, then the NSAID could take hold and really helped. You can use it along with your opiate if that is what you and your doctor decide. I found it took a good three weeks on a scheduled dose of ibuprofen before I got optimum effect. I really fear using prednisone for more than a couple of weeks 2-3 times a year. The side effects of chronic prednisone use are pretty scary. If you have a real need for it, then you have to balance the possible risks vs. benefits. You really need to discuss this all with your doctor and see what he suggests. Take care, Annette""You just do what you have to do. As long as you are aware of the possible side effects and watch for them so you can address them right away. Take care, Annette""OxyIR is also used for the beginning stages of chronic pain before one changes to long acting meds. Then it is often used for breakthrough pain that the long acting meds don<APO>t cover well. You were taking the opioids, muscle relaxants, a sleeping pill, and ""washing it all down with beer, wine, or vodka."" I wouldn<APO>t be surprised that your mind was mush. I disagree that everyone who uses opioids for long term pain management feels the same way. Especially those of us who do not mix our meds with alcohol. I do not use alcohol, coffee, or tobacco. I have increased my opioid dose about once every 4-5 years as needed. I would not describe myself as ""doped up all day"". I feel my brain works pretty darn well. Doesn<APO>t seem mushy at all. I certainly do not think anyone should go straight to daily opioid use for chronic pain, it should be the last option not the first. I also believe it should be one of many tools we use for our chronic pain, not the only one, or even the first one we think of. I think using an in-patient program to detox and begin pain management is great, but not everyone has access to programs like that, either because they do not exist in their area or because of the cost and perhaps a lack of good health insurance. We should all do whatever works for us, and be aware that all drugs have the possibility of causing side effects. Please share some of the things you learned to manage your pain without drugs, drinking, or coffee. I use lots of different things in addition to my meds. I am always open to hearing more. Take care, Annette""I agree, she should see a doctor for an evaluation. Any lapse in memory often indicates a loss of consciousness, however short. Concussions don<APO>t cause a fever. She may have something else entirely that is giving her the fever. Take care, Annette.""You might check and see if the manufacturer has a consumer assistance program that may give you a discount or even give you Lyrica for free. Call the 800 number for the company and ask for the assistance program. They will tell you what they can do to help you. I use neurontin, tried Lyrica, and did not feel it was any better. So, I am back on neurontin and like it just fine. Take care, Annette""I have been on neurontin for nearly ten years. It is also for nerve pain. It works fine. It is chemically very similar to lyrica and is available in generic, so the insurance company will probably pay for it. I tried lyrica and did not find it worked any better than the neurontin so I went back to it. Take care, Annette""I am a bit confused regarding your last paragraph about neurontin. If you don<APO>t feel any pain, how can the ""physical pain"" exhaust you and thereby cause you deep depression? Wouldn<APO>t any pain reliever cause depression using this logic? I understand how overdoing it can cause exhaustion, but I would just consider that you were much more active than usual and therefore more tired. I would use the amount of tiredness I feel to control the amount of activity I do, like regular, pain free people do. The neurontin was just doing what it was supposed to do, relieve the pain. Neurontin only causes depression in about 2% of the people who use it according to my drug handbook. That is a very small percentage. Take care, Annette""You know this is not a question we can answer, you have to ask the doctor involved in this. Take care, Annette""Back when I was still working, I would add new meds or adjust doses on weekends so I would see how I was going to react while it was not a workday. Is the neurontin the only new drug you are going to start? I assumed you are already on the other drugs, but I may be mistaken. I would only start one new drug at a time, so that I would know what side effects are from what drug. Sedation is a frequent side effect of many of these drugs, but it is usually temporary, so try and wait it out until it goes away. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t have an answer for this. That is the highest dose of fentanyl patches I have seen. If he detoxes, that would mean tapering slowly off the fentanyl, he would have his regular back pain, and may have some withdrawal symptoms, depending on how slowly and how skillfully the taper goes. Once he is off completely and it is out of his body, he would no longer have the tolerance he now has, so smaller doses would work better for him than they do now. I assume that is what the doctors want. The other option for getting off would be a rapid detox done under a general anesthetic. It is usually done as a out patient procedure. Once the patient is put under, they give him medicine IV that washes the opiates out of his system. When he wakes up, he is no longer dependent on the opiate drugs. He could then start out clean and sober, and use smaller doses of the opiates like I mentioned before. Good luck. Take care, Annette""I would avoid the chiropractor for now. They often do more harm than good. Just because the MRI shows a herniated disc doesn<APO>t mean you have to do anything about it. I have peacefully ignored one in my neck for 17 years now. What symptoms are you having that relate to this part of your spine? Take care, Annette""This may be a side effect of one of your meds. Discuss this with your doctor. Perhaps adjusting your meds will help. Take care, Annette""I agree with Charles about the possibility of weight gain. I also saw that in many of my patients who used tricyclic antidepressants. Many people, myself included, opt to at least try older drugs before the newer ones because they are generally cheaper, and their safety record is well known over the long term. Most of the SSRIs do have fewer side effects statistically, but if you are not one of the folks who get the side effects, what difference does it make to you? I took tricyclic antidepressants for may years for migraine prevention, and never had any side effect other than a dry mouth at the higher doses. When I finally went to a yet higher dose and developed unpleasant side effects, I switched drugs. I never did gain weight. In the case of trazedone, it does help with pain for some people, and as you have found it may help one sleep. The newer SSRIs usually do not help one sleep. I have not found any antidepressants to help with my chronic pain. I just don<APO>t use them at all anymore. I took trazedone many years ago, and was so zombied out, that I got off of it fairly quickly. We all react differently to drugs. Take care, Annette""Although trazedone did not agree with me, and I did not take it for long, I do not recommend stopping any drug abruptly based on the fact that it may contribute to hair loss. Most drugs who do cause hair loss, don<APO>t cause permanent loss, so don<APO>t panic. I looked this drug up in my drug handbook for advanced practice nurses, and it does not mention hair loss as a side effect at all. It can cause both weight gain and weight loss in 1-10% of users according to the book. Please discuss this with your pharmacist and your doctor before discontinuing it. Take care, Annette""There are dozens of preventative drugs to take for migraines, and a dozen or more rescue drugs. Without knowing what you have tried, it would be impossible to guess what you could try next. If your current doctor has no other suggestions, ask for a referral to a headache specialist. When you go for your first appt. take a list of EVERY med you have taken for migraines, the dose, schedule, and what combinations of meds you have taken. I never used acupuncture for migraines, I did take it for a different kind of chronic pain and it did not work for me. I did not consider botox for my migraines because the results were only about 50/50 according to the research back then. Too expensive for such bad odds. Take care, Annette""If you are changing HMOs in January, you need to ask yourself if the new one will cover a newly diagnosed condition in your back, or will they boot it as a pre-existing condition? I hate it that we even have to ask these questions, but with our current insurance situation, we do. If your insurance is through your employer and the company is changing it may not make any difference at all. It seems like it is mainly when we buy our own private insurance that it matters. If it would affect your insurance, you need to decide when and what to tell your doctors. If the insurance is not an issue, I would talk to both doctors about this problem. I don<APO>t know that you would necessarily need another MRI. that would depend on how long the symptoms last and what your physical exam shows. Take care, Annette""I would call your pharmacist and ask him. Take care, Annette""I am so glad to hear the gabapentin is working for you. It seems to me that some nasal drainage can be a side effect of gabapentin, but I can<APO>t remember for sure, ask your pharmacist. I started taking it about ten years ago, I can<APO>t remember that far back accurately. I also believe in using the lowest possible dose that works. Take care, Annette""That is in a couple of days. I would have explained to whoever called me that I had already been told that I had nothing surgical, and could they double check and find out why the surgeon wanted to see me. it is too late for that now. I agree with the others that someone who looked at the MRI may have seen things a bit differently than the first person who looked at it. He may just want to go over that with you. At this point, I would just go see the doctor and find out what he wants. But if he just repeats when they told you over the phone, I would refuse to pay for the appt. Take care, Annette""After a month from the original injury, the bones have already begun to heal as they were left. I assume the doctor who saw you the first time re-broke the bone and then reduced it and applied a cast. You have to learn to speak up for yourself. It is hard to imagine a person putting on a splint so tight it broke your bone again, but leaving it go broken again would make things much worse. I don<APO>t know if it is even possible to fix the fractured twice and healed metacarpal bone by breaking it yet again and resetting it. I would see an orthopedic surgeon for another opinion. It surgery is not an option, you might speak to a pain management specialist. If future, don<APO>t punch things, lol, and if you do, see a doctor right away. Take care, Annette""Everyone is different. My hubby had surgery to replace his hip, and he went home using the same amount of pain meds that he was taking at home prior to the surgery. His pcp wrote all his pain meds for him, we tore up the RX the surgeon gave him in front of the discharging nurse. Explain to the foot doctor what your current meds are and ask him if you should take the 5 mg. on top of your regular meds, or if you should discuss this with your doctor who prescribes your regular meds. Did you make an agreement with your own doctor not to get pain meds from anyone else? If you did, then discuss this with him before you take any of the new drugs. It is a myth that opiates won<APO>t work when you need them for surgery, etc. if you take them daily for chronic pain. It is all a matter of dose. Take care, Annette""Just be sure to discuss all the pain meds stuff before you actually schedule surgery. I really recommend a teaching hospital that has a pain management team if possible. They managed my husband<APO>s chronic pain and his surgical pain very well during his stay there. Surgeons really are not very good at managing chronic pain issues. Take care, Annette""I disagree with both of you, lol. In some cases, seeing a chiro may not hurt you at all, in other cases it can kill you. I took my MRI report to my hubby<APO>s chiro and he told me not to let any chiro EVER touch me. I had herniated discs in my neck. He said there was no kind of chiro treatment that would help and it could make things much worse. He had been in practice for many years and I trusted him. His treatment improved my hubby and relieved his pain completely. A nurse friend of mine had a stroke in her chiro<APO>s office as he did a neck adjustment. Medical studies showed that the vertebral artery can be torn during a neck adjustment and it can split up into the brain causing a stroke. It took her three years to recover completely enough to go back to work. She is never going back to the chiro. Many years ago I saw a chiro and got great relief from her treatment, but that was after I saw an MD, and had the appropriate imaging done to make a diagnosis. The usual medical treatment did not help me. Can a chiro even order MRIs and CTs? They have not been able to order anything a doctor does anywhere I lived. Has that changed? They do xrays in their own offices, but they never ordered any films that I would have done elsewhere. I would see a MD or a DO first, then after you know what you are dealing with, you can consider all forms of alternative medicine. Many DOs do manipulations as well as all things MDs do, including prescribe drugs. Take care, Annette""For alternative views on chiropractic, go to quackwatch.com and do a search for chiropractic medicine. Take care, Annette""Excuse me, but all chiros are not as good as the ones we have seen. I called different chiropractors on the phone after my MRI was done by my doctor, and explained that I had disc herniations and bulging discs in my neck, and 3 out of 4 told me they could fix me completely and wanted to set up appts. It was only the older guy my hubby went to that told me to stay away from chiros because my neck was too far gone to be helped with chiropratic. I asked about the MRIs and CTs because in states where I have lived they could not order these tests. Things change, and rules of practice vary from state to state depending on licensing rules. Since I have actually met a person who had a stroke while being adjusted, but have NEVER met a person who had a stroke while getting her hair shampooed, I cannot respond to your other comment. I read medical journals, and have read about strokes happening during adjustments and why they happen. I never said they were killing people, just that some people had strokes when their neck was adjusted. I have been exposed to two types of chiropractic adjustments, my hubby<APO>s old chiro did the contortionist, back cracking, scary ones, my hubby loved them, he said he could feel his back get better. The chiro I went to years back did totally gentle ones with a hand held machine that gently thumped the vertebrae to ease them back into place. There was nothing she did that scared me, she was working on my mid to lower back at the time, that was before my neck went bad. If they were all like MY old chiros, I probably would not have the objections to them that I do. However, until they all admit that they can<APO>t fix everything, I feel it is not safe for patients to see them without being worked up by their MDs first, and advised if it is safe to see a chiro. I am not totally against chiros working on lower backs to mid backs after an MD work-up, but I would personally not suggest someone go for their necks to be worked on. Just my opinion, that is all anyone can offer. Again I would suggest everyone do a search on quackwatch.com to get the other side of chiropractic. Take care, Annette""What do you mean you feel like crap? That is not enough information. Are you still taking the neurontin? Taking percocet for ""nearly a week"" is unlikely to cause any problems at all. Your body will eventually adjust to the meds you are currently taking. You may be having side effects from the neurontin, they usually go away after a few weeks on a steady dose. Discuss this all with your doctor, he will advise you as to the best thing to do. Take care, Annette""My husband was on Cymbalta when he had his hip replaced and he had no difference in healing that we could see. He had some other minor injuries during that time also and had no changes in healing that we noticed. Take care, Annette""I am a retired RN and I volunteered at a free clinic for nine years. It was FREE. They accepted donations if one could afford it, but if you didn<APO>t have the $$ it did not matter, you were still seen. We could not fix everything, but no one can. Give it a look see and try again. Take care, Annette""Keeping burns covered will usually really decrease the pain. By covered, I mean keep the air off of them entirely. That is one reason they use the cream and gauze wraps, they seal the air out. Discuss it with your doctor. Take care, Annette""There are a lot of different antidepressants that work for pain management besides Cymbalta. I would discuss it with your doctor in person, not on the phone. There would be no reason for them to think you were a drug seeker for asking about this. That only pertains to pain pills. Take care, Annette""There are many other medication options for you, especially while you are on such a low dose of fentantyl. You can switch to any of the oral long acting opioids without having to go through withdrawal. Discuss all the pros and cons with your doctor. I personally feel any of the oral meds will work for most people if the dose is adjusted properly. I recently switched from a generic MS Contin that I was taking twice a day (it did work fine for twice a day dosing) to methadone. Because I opted to start at half the dose my doctor said would probably end up best for me, I have a bit more pain, but I am using BT meds for that. She and I discussed a plan and I am using that to make the change. I really wanted to start low and move up slowly, because methadone acts a bit differently than other drugs. I will increase the dose after one week if necessary. I opted to make the change for financial reasons because I am going on Medicare part D, and I do not want to end up in the donut hole every year. I need to keep my med costs down in order to do that. Methadone is really cheap, $5-7 dollars a month at the dose my doctor thinks I will end up on for now. You also don<APO>t need to take oral morphine every 4 hours, there are generic long acting morphine formulas that work fine and are cheaper than the brand name drugs. Talk all this over with your doctor!!! Take care, Annette""I understand that. I just wanted the poster to be aware that there are both long and short acting forms of morphine available. Take care, Annette""Discuss this with your doctor. Why were you wearing the collar to begin with? You lose A LOT of muscle tone while wearing a collar for whatever reason. You may need to see a PT to get some exercises to do to build up that strength again. Take care, Annette""I would just tell him at the start of your next appt. that the morphine makes you ill and you would like something different. Odds are that if one makes you sick they all may, and often this side effect goes away over time, but be firm in what you are asking. At least try the others, one may work better for you. You say you have tried other pain meds, do you know which ones work better for you? This is an appropriate time to tell him. If he writes the same old morphine RX, just hand it back to him and say I<APO>m sorry, you need to change this one, you forgot it makes me sick. It might help to take a spouse or friend with you to the appt. so you have a witness. I hate to say it, but many doctors are easier to manage when there is a witness present. They can<APO>t really bully patients in front of someone else. How long has it been since your accident? Do you expect more improvement or will you be at these pain levels permanently? Take care, Annette""Why does your surgeon want you off of all your pain meds prior to your surgery? I do not see why this would be necessary. You need to have a nice conversation with your surgeon, and ask him all these questions. He should give you straight answers to them all and others too, before you decide to even have surgery. What is his success rate with patients like you? What does he consider successful surgery? Does he expect you to be pain free, have less pain, improved mobility, etc.? Does he expect you to continue to need pain meds after surgery for long term? What is his infection rate? This is VERY important, and he should be able to tell you. If he says ""My patients don<APO>t get infections."" he either doesn<APO>t do many surgeries, or he is not telling the truth. I have had surgeons look me in the eye, or not, and tell me just that. I looked for and found other surgeons who were better prepared to answer my questions. The stats I have read for spinal surgery is that about 50% of surgical patients get at least 50% reduction in pain, and a higher percentage get better outcomes for nerve damage related functional things. I had one disc removed back in 1992 in my neck. I did this when my hands stopped working properly. My neurosurgeon said that the outcomes for pain reduction were not good enough for the risks taken to do the surgery. He would only do the surgery if you had functional deficits. I agree with him. Six months later the disc above the operative site herniated, I opted to not do anything about it, and I do not regret that decision. Having done both the surgery and the medical management, I would avoid surgery in the future when possible. I have also read that doing no surgery for disc disease gets the same results after two years that surgery does. This also goes along with my own experience. It would be hard to convince me to have another spinal surgery unless I was having severe neurological deficits that made mobility difficult, or led to incontinence. Why is not the pain management doctor that is doing the ESIs writing your pain med prescriptions? If he is unwilling, I would ask for a referral to a doctor who is willing to offer me all the pain management techniques available, including oral meds. My pcp manages my chronic pain and I am very happy with her. I have seen internists, rheumatologists, and pain management specialists in the past. I have met good and bad of all three kinds of doctors. I prefer my internist manage all my health issues, so that is what I do now. Take care, Annette""The tylenol arthritis that you take would probably affect your liver more than the opioids do. None of the reading I have done over many years says that chronic opioid use as prescribed for pain will harm any organs. The main side effect one gets is constipation, that can be helped with a bowel plan you discuss with your doctor. My main advice is to keep your opiate dose as low as possible for as long as possible. Use other means to soothe flares when you can rather than just increasing your pain meds. I like pain.com for good info about pain management. Take care, Annette""I forgot to mention, do NOT ever mix alcohol and your meds if you want to keep your liver healthy. Take care, Annette""You can only be diagnosed by a doctor. Any new or different head pain should be evaluated as you could have something serious, although that is not likely. My hubby had migraines years back, then none for years, and then had a headache that felt the same to him. He avoided going to the doctor for one week, and we finally had the huge argument and he went. He had a brain bleed that required treatment. He could have died. Headaches are not something to fool around with. Take care, Annette""In my experience a ""protrusion"" is a bulging disc. I have never heard of anyone having surgery for one bulging disc. You are on minimal meds, I would seek more medical treatment, trying other meds perhaps, or PT. Have you seen a neurologist? (not a neurosurgeon) Take care, Annette""Go back to the VA, either continue in group therapy or see an individual counselor. Use whatever antidepressants a doctor might suggest for at least 3-4 months. Give them a chance to work, and help you dig yourself out. In group, you do not have to say any more than you feel able to as you get used to the newness of it all. None of it is easy, but it will be worth it to get back to your life. Take care, Annette""Thank you for your military service. I forgot to say this when I posted back to you a few minutes ago. Take care, Annette""Print out this post and take it to your MD at the VA. Explain to him how you are feeling. All the pain meds you mentioned are short acting ones, you may need a scheduled long acting pain med if you have not tried them already. Take care, Annette PS, Thank you for your service.""Travel by car is fairly easy to manage with a risk of clots. I have had a clot in my leg, so I am somewhat familiar with this personally. My doctor just told me that I should stop and get out of the car and walk around every half hour or so. Your hubby<APO>s doc can tell him how often he should get out and walk around. This gets the blood pumping and moving so it won<APO>t clot as easily. He would also need to discuss with the doctor getting compression hose to wear if he doesn<APO>t have them already. If he is able to sit/lay and watch TV or read or do puzzles, etc. and get up occasionally, he should be able to do the same in the car. There are medications that can be taken to prevent clots. Has the doctor specifically said that standing in the MRI for the time it takes to do a head scan poses too great a risk for your hubby? Or is this just something that is scaring you and your hubby? Discuss it with his doctor to allay your concerns. The only MRIs without weight limits would be the ones he must stand upright in, because his weight is not on the machine<APO>s table. Clearly, that is what he will have to deal with, so figure out how you can make it work. If your hubby and his doctor feel that the info from the MRI would not be worth the risk, he can decline to do it. Certainly if the doctor felt the risk is too great for him, he would not even suggest it until he loses weight and can fit in a regular MRI machine. Take care, Annette""I, for one, love your imaginary picture of me. Maybe that is why I don<APO>t post a photo? Nah, it is because I don<APO>t know how to, lol. I am taller and heavier, but let<APO>s just leave it at that. I figure you must be tall, dark, and handsome. Take care, Annette""That goes with the musician image I have of you, lol. Hugs, Annette""If for some reason they cannot to an MRI, a CT would usually show a stroke. I cannot imagine any imaging site refusing to see a patient for no good reason, it is all about money to them. Take care, Annette""How much does he weigh? CTs are big open machines, so I assume the weight limits are for the part of the machine that moves him in and out of the CT opening. I can remember when they did not have scanners readily available in many parts of the country, doctors just had to use their clinical skills to diagnose and treat people. It is hard to go back when now we have these wonderful machines, but you may have to just depend on his doctor. Take care, Annette""I just did a quick Google search on ""MRI machines and weight limits"" and ""CT machines and weight limits"". I found that MRIs vary in their ability to handle obese patients. They varied in the amount of weight they could tolerate, I found anywhere from 350 to 550 pounds, depending on the machine. CT machines seemed to only manage about 300 pounds. You might try Googling MRI machines in your area, then calling each place. You may have to travel some distance to find a machine that will handle your husband<APO>s weight. The problem seems to be about breaking the table that moves the patient in and out of the machine. That is true of the open machines also. Take care, Annette""Well, if the machines only hold 400 pounds and he is over that limit, his choice is to do the standing one or skip it altogether. All things have possible risks and benefits, you have to weigh the two and decide what is better for him. Depending on the speed of the particular machine he shouldn<APO>t be in it for more than about an hour. His doctor would have to help him decide if the risk of blood colts is worth the information gleaned from the test. Perhaps the doctor can do something to help him avoid clots for that short amount of time. He might also consider slowly losing weight if he isn<APO>t already. As you have found out, these diagnostic tools can be very helpful. Obesity can cause blood clots all by itself. I am heavy too, but not as heavy as your hubby. I set an upper weight limit for myself where I can still get the tests I might need. It would be better for me if I were thinner but so far no diabetes or hypertension or any other weight related problems. I don<APO>t smoke, drink alcohol or do illegal drugs. Perhaps I should get on top of the weight thing too. Americans are getting heavier and heavier, we should all be more active and get healthier. Take care, Annette""I would get at least two current surgical opinions, you have one, so get one more. Often times surgery is NOT the best option. Are you seeing a pain management specialist that manages oral pain meds including long term opiates as well as injections? I would try that if you have not already. I feel that if you can get a small amount of relief from each of several treatments, the total amount of relief will be worthwhile. I would aim in that direction. Take care, Annette""If the injections aren<APO>t working anymore, I would refuse them. Ask the doctor for something else and if he says he can<APO>t do anything more for you, then get a referral to someone else. I still would not do surgery for bulging discs, even multiple ones, just my opinion. Your meds are pretty much the basic beginning ones, but there are others or higher doses that can be tried. As long as it is to give you better function it is reasonable to try them. Lortabs are short acting opiates, there are long acting opiates that can be taken on a set schedule so you don<APO>t have the ups and downs in your opiate blood levels, thus you have less ups and downs in your pain relief. The gabapentin can also go higher if that helps, if not, try something else. Talk to your doctor, get a referral if necessary. Take care, Annette""It depends on the circumstances. If you broke the rules of his practice, he can dump you as a patient without any tapering of meds. Withdrawal from percocet after several months may be uncomfortable and your original pain will certainly come back, but it is not dangerous. If you feel he treated you badly or unfairly you can report him to your state board of medical licensing. If they get creditable complaints against him they will do an investigation and disciplinary action may be taken. Take care, Annette""Usually, if someone has more than 3 migraines a month, the doctor suggests a preventative medication, but it doesn<APO>t sound like your daughter meets that criteria. That is for adults anyway, I don<APO>t know what is usually done for kids. Fevers are not usually a part of migraines, and 101.3 is definitely a fever. It sounds like they ordered the proper tests. Did she have any episodes while she was in the hospital, so they could see what she was like? Did they do an EEG during an episode? This would show if she had a seizure or not. Was the neurologist she saw a pediatric neurologist? If my son was 19 months old, I would want pediatric specialists for anything as serious as what you are talking about. Often neurologists see both kids and adults, but for a kid with a growing brain, I would want the pediatric specialist. Is she meeting all her developmental milestones? This is where a pediatric specialist comes in, they are in tune with what a 19 month old kids should be doing, they notice if the child is not doing what it should by a certain age. All kids are different, but they still should fall within a certain age range for doing things like walking, talking, etc. Find a good doctor for your girl, even if you have to travel to do so. Take care, Annette""If they can get an EEG during an episode, then they will know for sure if she is having any seizure activity. That is the only way I know of to know for certain that she is not having seizures. If she is not, that is a good thing. If all the tests turn out negative, and they decide she is having some sort of migraine, then you know what you are dealing with and can proceed with treatment as recommended by the pediatric neurologist. Migraines can be frustrating, because there is no specific test to tell you that is what it is, but if all the other tests come out negative, that is what you are left with. It sounds like you are doing all the right things. Keep in touch. Take care, Annette""You need to find a doctor and stick with him. Write down what you have tried already, side effects, etc., and keep a journal of how much your pain bothers you for a few weeks. Be careful taking over the counter meds like tylenol and ibuprofen, never take more than the box recommends unless a doctor tell you it is okay. If they don<APO>t work, they don<APO>t work, they are usually not the kid of drug that you just keep taking more of hoping it does work. Take care, Annette""One should always go to the ER or a clinic where you can get a CT scan of the head for the ""worst headache ever"", especially with vomiting. The odds are that it is a migraine, but it can also be something serious inside the head, that is why they do CT scans. My husband had a history of migraines, and had one that would not go away, it put him on his knees it was so bad. We argued big time, and he went to the urgent care clinic, the doctor there sent us to the local community hospital and he had a bleed in his brain. He could have died, but with good treatment and follow up he did fine. When one goes to the ER in the US, they must see you and figure out if you have anything life threatening. Then they send you the bill, ouch. When you get the bill, you take it to the hospital business office and ask about indigent care assistance. They may do a payment plan, or let you pay a discounted amount, sometimes they cancel your debt altogether. The federal govt. forces them to have these indigent programs, but they do not have to tell you about them, or tell you in advance how much you will have to pay. I would avoid aspirin and NSAIDs for now, in case he has a bleed. They could make him bleed worse. Otherwise do like you are doing, with clear fluids and then follow that with toast, rice, applesauce, and bananas. Gradually, increase the amounts and the variety of food as he tolerates it. If he vomits, go back to the clear liquids and start over. While he is on liquids, give him about 1-2 oz. at a time, every 30 minutes or so. If he drinks too much at once, it may trigger vomiting. I encourage him to see a doctor about this, it is not the kind of thing that you should really treat at home on your own. Take care, Annette""I checked for that, but some of the posts did not have anything new that I had not already gotten through the email digests. Hopefully, this time they have something new and improved, it really will be better. They used to do that mark them ""new"" and bump them to the top with each new entry, then they got the new and improved software and it changed, I have only used the email digests since then. With them taking the email digests away soon, I will have to use the boards directly, so I will no doubt have a lot of questions. Thanks for the help. Take care, Annette""I think it was maybe because they shut down the boards for that one day. I am always signed in. Thanks for the help, as we go into the new changes, I will undoubtedly need more help. Thanks again, Annette""For whatever reason I dropped by the board directly instead of through the email digests that I usually use. Many of the posts are still marked ""New"", even though I have actually read and responded to many of them from several days ago. Usually, once the posts were sent to me via email digest, the ""New"" would be removed. What<APO>s up? Thanks, Annette""I used the state dept. of disability and vocational rehabilitation where I lived and they kept me able to work by changing jobs and giving me the support I needed. They also offered job training and education, although I didn<APO>t need that. They were wonderful. Thank you Charles for all your years of work in this field. Take care, Annette""I assume you are seeing a neurologist, if not go see one. Ask about migraines. I have a history of migraines and I went through a similar period where I felt almost like I was having a stroke. I would also get dizzy and sometimes I actually fell down. All tests run normal, but it is necessary to do them to make sure all else is okay. Mine happened when I was going through perimenopause and once I finished menopause things got some better. Maybe it was the crazy hormones. You mentioned some GYN problems, maybe your hormones are out of whack also. Back when I was still mentruating I had more severe migraines just before my period started. You might keep a symptom diary and just note ANY symptoms you have every day in a little note book. Also note when your period starts and ends, any drugs you take, etc. This may help you and your neurologist to figure this out. Take care, Annette""Yes, it is possible. Certainly not common, but it can happen. Perimenopause may start up to ten years before you actually go through menopause. I think your OB-GYN or your pcp can do a blood test to check your hormaone levels. Take care, Annette""Go see your family doctor and get your arm evaluated. I have had bad needle sticks that caused nerve irritation. A short course of oral steroids has always fixed it up rather quickly. I am a nurse, and there can always be complications when someone sticks a needle through your skin. Thankfully, the complications are usually managed without incident. You might write a short letter to the head radiologist telling him of your experience. If no one complains, the tech who did the IV stick won<APO>t learn to do it correctly. (I also tell people who have had good medical experiences to write letters so the bosses know who is doing a good job.) Take care, Annette""I would suggest you see a good infectious disease doctor for a consultation about the possibility of another infection, before you schedule any surgery. Make sure the bugs are all gone and see what the odds of him getting another infection are. Has he tried the oral baclofen? Did he have any other drugs in the pump, or just baclofen? Take care, Annette""Best of luck to you both. I think specialists are made for complicated cases like yours. Just make sure they all talk to each other. Take care, Annette""There are blood tests to determine if your kidneys or liver are working properly, and scans of various kinds will show their structure in case you have something going on there. If you are unsure, make an appt. with your PM doctor and go talk to him. Do not have any invasive procedure done unless you are sure you want to do it. Of course, there are risks, there are risks to any kind of surgery. Discuss this with your primary care doctor as well as your PM doctor. Ask them if they will keep giving you pain meds if the trial doesn<APO>t work out, some clinics do and some do not. You should know all this ahead of time. If you are worried about how it will all turn out, why are you signing up for a trial with a brand new product, instead of one that has a proven track record? Just curious. Take care, Annette""Three of the hydrocodone 10/500 includes 1500 mg. of acetaminophen (tylenol). This is 500 mg. more than is recommended for any single dose. This can cause liver damage that may not be fixable. DO NOT drink alcohol with these drugs, even on the same day. Please discuss this with your doctor. Take care, Annette""Tegaderm is the brand name for a medical product that can go over the patch and help keep it on, even under water. I think some brands of patches will provide you with these covers if you ask them for them. Call the manufacturer and ask them. The name of the manufacturer should be on the RX label of the patches. I have never used fentanyl for pain because using the patches is discouraged if you use a hot tub all the time, and I do. I used a generic long acting morphine pill for about 11 years and recently switched over to methadone. It is working very well for my pain. The change over did give me higher levels of pain for a week or so, but I used my BT meds and that worked fine. I decided with my doctor<APO>s okay that I wanted to start at a really low dose and work my way up very slowly. I feel that is safer with methadone. I am now taking 10 mg. three times a day and rarely using any breakthrough meds at this point. I have not had any side effects except less pain. Yahoo!!!! I have several chronic pain conditions including past spinal surgery in my neck and fibromyalgia. My husband used methadone for a couple of years for hip pain, and tapered off of it without any problem after he had hip replacement surgery a year or so ago. He was pleased with his pain management for the most part. Towards the end, nothing would control his pain if he was walking, but that was just part of his disease. Time to get that hip replaced, that<APO>s all, lol. I hope you find something that helps you. Please be sure and see a doctor who has experience in prescribing methadone if you choose to use it. It is a little trickier to prescribe correctly than the other opiates. Take it EXACTLY as prescribed, NEVER take extra. Talk to your doctor first. Take care, Annette""Only while you are under the care of a doctor. High doses of ibuprofen can cause organ damage including sudden bleeding of the stomach. If a doctor has you on higher doses of ibuprofen he will be monitoring you for kidney and liver function, and warn you about other possible side effects. Never take ibuprofen every four hours like you might aspirin or tylenol. It should only be taken every 6-8 hours depending on the dose. Take care, Annette""The clinical trial contact given in the newspaper are for a ""Home-based, Self-delivered Mirror Therapy for Phantom Limb Pain at Oregon Health and Science University"". It says to contact a Kathy Parker, 503-494-5224 or email at parkerk@ohsu.edu I realize this is not a trial you would use, but perhaps she can refer you to more information about it. I would not have put the information on line except that it was published in the newspaper, so it is not a private thing. Best of luck, if I hear of anything more, I will let you know. Hugs, Annette""From reading about this therapy, it does not sound like you would need to spend much money to do it. You might even be able to read about it and try it, at most, you might need one or two visits to a PT who knows about this treatment. The visual aid of seeing the reflection of the good leg moving this way and that, instead of looking at the bad leg seems to just reset the brain. It is one of those things that may help or may not, but should not cost you much to find out. I agree with your decision about stopping the amputation for now. It does sound like the RSD has spread out of the toe and into the front part of your foot from the color changes and pain changes you mentioned. Take care of yourself. Hugs, Annette""I just read an article about Mirror Therapy. It is used for amputees that get phantom pain, but the article said it is also being used in patients with RSD. Have you ever heard of it or tried it? They described putting a long mirror between your legs facing your good leg while lying on the couch. You look at the image of the good leg in the mirror and do certain exercises, moving your foot and toes a certain way, etc. while looking at the image in the mirror. This retrains your brain into thinking the mirror image is actually your bad leg, but it has no pain, and begins to feel like your good leg. One woman who was in a clinical study said once early on in therapy she accidentally touched the surface of the mirror with her good toes. She described that it felt just like she had touched the toes from both feet together rather than feeling like the cool glass surface of the mirror. It sounded very interesting. If you want the phone numbers for our local place that is involved in clinical trials ask and I will post them for you. Perhaps they will have the numbers of places that are involved with this that are closer to you. Or maybe you could Google it and find the info specific to RSD. Anyhow, I always think that any small amount of relief from one therapy can add to your other therapies and improve your life. Hugs, Annette""Keep in mind that a visit to the ER does not guarantee a visit by a neurosurgeon, you are more likely to get a referral to one, that you will have to pay for up front. I would suggest you go to a free or low cost clinic in your area. That will get you seen by a doctor, who can help you decide what you need to do next. The wonderful people who work and or volunteer at free clinics know how to get MRIs and specialist visits for free or reduced cost if you need one. Best of luck. Take care, Annette""Only way to know why they switched you is to ask them. We can<APO>t read their minds. Best of luck. Take care, Annette""This is a discussion you need to have with your doctor. He is the one who knows your medical history and he should know any interactions your old meds will have with any new meds. Just be honest with him about what you wish to do and why. Take care, Annette""Ditto what Gail said. My son had bloody noses as a child and the doctor told us to apply vaseline inside the nostrils twice a day for six weeks. It worked great. If your blood pressure goes up when you have a migraine, it can be more difficult to manage nose bleeds. It sounds like the topamax is working and the doctor is increasing the dose appropriately. I have had migraines for years, and they do tend to come and go, sometimes they are more difficult to manage than other times. Discuss all this with your doctor, don<APO>t leave anything out, he needs to know to treat you properly. Migraines are a real challenge to manage, but it is possible. Take care, Annette""Talk to your doctor about this, and you might also discuss this with your pharmacist, ask if depression or emotional reactions are common with this med. My drug handbook lists a number of emotional reactions as being due to gabapentin. These may be side effects that will go away with time, or they may be something that means you should not use that drug. You may be able to take a different antiseizure med that will help your pain but not cause emotional problems for you. They only lock up people who are suicidal, homicidal, or so mentally ill that they can no longer care for themselves. I don<APO>t think you fit any of those categories. Take care, Annette""I use a conversion tool on line for reference purposes. It includes a place for the doctor to put in a partial tolerance conversion factor. It is up to him how high a partial tolerance conversion factor to use. Many of the conversion tables that do not use a partial tolerance conversion factor are based on a one time dose for opiate naive people. They just say what the equianalgesic dose for different drugs are in that situation. I happen to agree with your doctor about starting out at the smallest dose when converting someone with chronic pain to a new drug. According to some conversion tables, that is 50% of the equianalgesic dose for chronic users. Then you adjust the dose as needed until you find the right dose for that patient. Everyone IS different, many people end up able to stay at the small dose originally prescribed, some go up a little ways and are fine, some must go past the equianalgesic dose to find the dose that works for them. The problem with just starting at the equianalgesic dose on the charts without a partial tolerance conversion factor is that a percentage of patients who do not have a strong partial tolerance to the new drug will overdose and die on the full dose of the new drug. There is no way to know exactly who develops a strong partial tolerance to opioids and will tolerate the full dose. There is no test to tell the doctor this, he must rely on his own judgment. I would rather start low and go up slowly than kill someone. That may be where your doctor is coming from also. He may well understand the conversion charts and exactly how they work. Take care, Annette""This is not uncommon. It may be a type of migraine. She needs to discuss this with her doctor and find the right treatment for it. There are a number of medicines on can take prior to love making to avoid this type of headache. Take care, Annette""You only have six weeks left until delivery. Opioids are not really recommended close to delivery if at all possible. Only you and your doctor can make this decision. Your OB doc knows that if anything went wrong, it would fall on him as the prescribing doctor. If the fetal medicine docs feel that strongly that you should have a stronger opiate, they can prescribe it for you. Stomach pain and gastric bleeding are serious side effects, but not allergic symptoms. I would avoid taking this drug also. You might also talk to your pcp and see what he says. Take care, Annette""When a doctor prescribes meds to a pregnant woman, he has more than one patient to think of. You can<APO>t treat pain as a separate disease when you are also treating a baby in utero. Whether we like it or not, that baby also gets the drugs taken by the mother. Some drugs are safer than others, and opiates are fairly safe at certain times during a pregnancy and in certain doses. Only the prescribing doctor can decide what is right for him to prescribe. A woman is free to look for a different doctor if she feels her OB is acting incorrectly. I think this woman should talk to the fetal medicine doctors and ask them who she should see to get better relief. There may be other options besides opiates, I don<APO>t know. Take care, Annette""Hives and trouble breathing are definite signs of an allergy. I would not take any drug again that gave me hives shortly after taking it. I would take a photo of the rash and go see the doctor again, take the photo if the hives have gone away by them. Nausea and vomiting is a side effect of codeine in from 1-10% of users according to my drug book. Not really uncommon. Some types of rashes are a side effect of the codeine, so a doctor would need to look at the rash to determine if it is indeed hives. However an itching rash of any kind would be reason enough for me not to take that drug again. Even if it were side effects, it would make me too uncomfortable to continue it. Take care, Annette""Hydrocodone is not to be given near term or near delivery in pregnant women. It is labeled a B/D drug for pregnant women, B is for early to mid-pregnancy, and D is for near term. B is pretty much safe for the fetus and D is definitely not safe for the baby. Only the doctor who writes the RX gets to decide how near term to prescribe it. Six weeks is pretty close to delivery. I would suggest she try all the non-drug treatments you mentioned. You have some good suggestions in your post for non-drug, non-surgical pain treatments. It is pretty close to delivery to think about trying surgical treatments like the SCS or intrathecal infusion pumps. Most doctors are not going to suggest those for a pregnant woman this far along. Take care, Annette""That is great that the doctor evaluated your need for pain meds and came up with a plan for you and the baby. I am glad you have found some relief with the vicodin. Hopefully, now the Maternal Fetal Medicine group will be able to manage your care. Best of luck to you and the baby!! Take care, Annette""With many meds you have to just stick with them for a few weeks to see if side effects will go away or not. It doesn<APO>t sound like you are able to stay with any of them for long because they seem to make your pain worse. I would suggest you see a pain management specialist and work out just what you can and cannot take due to your allergy to codeine. You might consider going to an allergist and having skin testing to make sure of what you are allergic to. That said, not everyone can take opioids and get really positive results from them. They may not be good drugs for you to take, but you have a ways to go before you give up on them altogether. Take care, Annette""My understanding is that Prialt is to be used when all other meds fail. So if the opiates don<APO>t work for you, the Prialt is what you should be depending on. If you are not having any mental deficits from the Prialt, but are only scared that you might, I would follow the doctor<APO>s suggestion and try the very slightly higher dose he suggests. Tell a family member or close friend that you are adjusting your dose and would like them to tell you if they notice any detrimental changes in you. See what happens. The fact that you accept and save unused Morphine RXs would make any doctor concerned about giving you more opiates. He may feel you are diverting them and selling them. Take all your meds AND unused RXs with you to the office and explain things to the MD and/or PA.. You would not know if you are intolerant to meds of any kind until you take them as prescribed and see what happens. I remind my doctor to take blood and test my organ function if she doesn<APO>t remember to do it. You are both associates in your care, you can ask for tests you feel are important, if he refuses to do them, ask for a reason why. Then you can always go to your pcp and discuss this with him. The main thing is to have an open and honest discussion with your doctor about all these concerns. Write down everything you are concerned about and take the list with you. Take a friend with you to the appt. sometimes a witness will urge a doctor to take more time and explain things better. It if makes him angry I would start looking for another doctor. Best of luck to you, let us know what happens. Take care, Annette""Opana is a long acting opiate. When you begin taking one, it often requires some adjustments in your dose while you figure out what level of medication you need. Just make an appt. and go see your doctor and explain to him that the present meds are not working well. Be prepared to tell him what your current pain scores are. It might help to keep a pain journal for awhile and show him how you are doing. Write in your pain scores several times a day, and the time and dose of any meds you take. Adding an anti-depressant or an anti-seizure med might help your pain levels also. Take care, Annette""Opana is a long acting opiate. It is one of the newer ones. Take care, Annette""I have a long history of migraines and FMS, and valium is really not one of the best drugs for migraines, nor is it a good FMS treatment. You are at the high end of dosing for valium, if it doesn<APO>t work, I would try a different drug. There are lots of drugs available for both FMS and migraines. Many drugs will help with both. My drug book also says 10 mg. is the highest dose one should take at a time. Did your doctor tell you to take 20 mg. at bedtime? What other medicines do you take? Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t have any answers for you. My husband had AVN of one hip and had to wait nearly two years after the doc suggested a total hip replacement because he had other health issues that had to be resolved first. He worked as a big truck mechanic all that time. He was in terrible pain, but managed to keep on working. Once he had the hip replaced life went very well for him. Most of his pain resolved. So, I understand what you are going through. Do the best you can, that is all anyone can expect of you. Take care, Annette""I am going away for a couple of weeks. Will be home around the first of the year. I am going to visit my son and his family for Xmas. I am so stoked. Anyhow, I do not use the computer when I am on vacation, so I won<APO>t be checking in after tonight. I hope every one has a nice holiday season whatever your religion or lack of it. See you later. Hugs, Annette""It is unethical for any medical provider to prescribe meds/supplements that he wants to sell you himself. Ask him to write down the name of any supplements he wants you to take, and then do the research, and go buy them somewhere else if you decide to try them. I personally feel that any treatments your insurance company won<APO>t pay for are probably not proven to be medically effective anyway. Once a treatment has been proven to be medically effective, medicare, and insurance companies are pretty quick to begin paying for it. If in doubt, ask him for research including ""double blind trials"" that show his suggestions to be medically effective. Read the sources, or come post them here and we can all read them and give you our opinions. Take care, Annette""Only folks on opiate therapy assume that sweats, tremors, and anxiety are due to opiate withdrawal. They could be due to a lot of different things, even other meds. Menopause can cause sweating, as can some opiates in some people. I don<APO>t know what all your meds are, but the Adderall can cause anxiety and tremors, it is a combination of dexamphetamine and amphetamine after all. If your thyroid level is too high it could also be at the bottom of some of your symptoms. You might ask your pharmacist if any of the meds you are on have any side effects either alone or together that could cause your symptoms. A clue for me would be that you are only complaining of symptoms when you wake up. Do you have them at other times? What time do you take each of your meds? It sounds like you might need to review some recent or new lab work with your doctor to even begin to find the reasons you are having all these problems. Take care, Annette""If she is not a candidate for surgery, then she should see a pain management specialist to treat her pain. Even if they cannot treat the cause of her pain and fix that surgically, they should be able to treat the symptom. Take care, Annette""We all have to make our own choices, but I would not bother with the injections or surgery. I would see a PM doctor and get an a more aggressive medication treatment plan. Just take a short acting opiate for pain is fine after an acute injury, but for a chronic pain situation, I would ask about long acting opiates on a set schedule with short acting ones to take as a break through med. I had a C5-6 discectomy in 1992 when I was losing function in my hands, and then six months later I was rear-ended at a stop sign and the next disc herniated. I opted to leave that one alone and avoid surgery as I only had pain, but no loss of function. That worked best for me. Surgery only has about a 50% chance of working for pain relief. My neurosurgeon would only mess with discs if ones function was bad. He said the odds for pain relief were not worth the risks. I am reading the same stats these days for pain relief with spinal surgery. I would also ask about an antidepressant and a seizure drug to add to the mix. Often by taking a cocktail of drugs and doing biofeedback, cognitive behavioral therapy, PT, etc. you can live fairly comfortably for years. You did not mention any meds except the lortabs, so I don<APO>t know if you have already tried other things or not. Take care, Annette""Medicare is not available to people on SSDI for two years after their date of disability is determined by the SSA. It is crazy, you can<APO>t work and get insurance, what do they expect people to do? For me in my state, the SSDI I get makes me ineligible for medicaid, too much income. Check out all your information on the ssa.gov website for SSDI before you apply. I strongly recommend you see an experienced lawyer to help you with the paperwork, not everyone is fortunate enough to be approved in 45 days. It took me about 14 months, and I had to have a hearing before a judge. I have met people who took 2 years to get it approved. A lot of it apparently depends on where you live. SSA told me South Dakota was the fastest place to get approved if you had to have a hearing as they do not have the backlog that they have in my state.""All the radiologist does is write a report based on what he sees on the films, he does not really make a diagnosis. Your pcp would have done that after checking out the xray/MRI and examining you and taking a medical history. I agree with Cheree that the doctor at the pain management clinic may have wanted to examine you unmedicated so he could see how far you could move until the pain would make you stop. That is really the best way for him to tell where to inject you to fix your pain. If you aren<APO>t in pain when you see him how can he figure out the best place to put the injection that your pcp sent you there in hopes of getting. When I worked in the ER, surgeons hated it if we medicated patients with abdominal pain before they examined them, it really hinders making a good exam if the patient has had too much medicine. His main job is not to make a diagnosis, but to treat your pain so you can best function in life. If I wanted to be certain of a diagnosis with back pain, I would go from my pcp to a neurologist or orthopedic doctor who specializes in the spine. Take care, Annette""There are ""unconventional"" chairs using your knees instead of your backside, or I have even seen them with a tractor seat or a bicycle seat attached to an office chair base on wheels. Talk to an occupational therapist about modifying your work station to work for you not against you. No one is telling you not to ride your bike, are they? Take care, Annette""I am a bit confused, are you still on the opiates, or just the balm he gave you? Who prescribes the opiates, him or your pcp? I find when I have changed doctors that they all want to try something new that they are sure will fix my problem. They mean well, they don<APO>t like seeing their patients in pain. I usually give it a try, and see if it will work. If it is something I have already used and failed at, or maybe if I can<APO>t find any evidence based studies to show it might work, I may suggest we go on to something else or ask for links to medical studies that show his remedy works. I used Lidoderm Patches for awhile when my pain was severe and to my surprise they actually worked pretty well, not for the widespread pain of FMS, but for hip and leg pain from FMS. Anything that helped even a little was welcome back then. I still have some just in case. Did you ask him just how he wanted you to use his balm mixture? How long should you use it before you might feel an improvement in your pain? Often I find it easier to wait to feel relief if I know how long I have to wait. He did say he would see you as needed, he didn<APO>t tell you to wait a month to come in again. I would give it a few days or a week then call and make an appt. if it is not helping. Call the office first thing in the AM and tell them your pain is out of control and you need to see the doctor for followup, as the balm did not work. Take care, Annette""I am also on methadone, but not at the dose you are on, and I live in Oregon. I asked my doctor to change my RX from morphine to methadone as it was much cheaper, and I didn<APO>t want to hit the donut hole on Medicare Part D. I do not know what the laws are in Florida, it is a legal drug in Oregon, and used often for pain management as well as opiate addiction treatment. I agree that going to a methadone clinic for treatment for addiction is probably not what you should do. I would call the Florida Medical Licensing Board and ask them what the rules are regarding treating pain with methadone, and what the best way to find another doctor is. When I moved to Oregon, I called the state licensing board here, and found them to be very helpful. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know what kind of injury W/C is treating you for, it sounds like a knee injury. A bulging disc is rarely caused by trauma or an acute injury. Bulging discs are usually just a part of aging, it is always hard to tell if they are causing the pain or not. Have you seen an orthopedic doctor yet? Did he suggest surgery of any kind for your knee? A pain management doctor is a ""real"" doctor. They are real doctors who have additional training and certification for pain management. You say you are in pain everyday, go hear what he has to say. Maybe he will have something to offer, and if you don<APO>t want to do anything he suggests you don<APO>t have to. There are also other kinds of medicines to take for pain besides the traditional pain pills. If you wish to, you can always go to your own doctor and ask for a second opinion. Maybe he has something to offer you. Take care, Annette""I guess we have to advise patients that there are three types of pain management clinics available now, the invasive procedure/surgery/injection type, the ""pill mills"" or doctors that only use opioids, and the third kind that uses both of those types of treatment, and also uses many other types of non-opioid treatments for the reduction of chronic pain. I would suggest everyone use the last type, myself, but that is my option. I see my pcp for most of my pain relief needs, but have seen a doctor who uses all kinds of treatments every ten years or so, just in case something new has been found out. By the way, fentanyl is prescribed in micrograms/hour when used in patches and micrograms for oral use. Micrograms and mg.(milligram) are completely different measurements, micrograms are much smaller than milligrams. I disagree with blanket statements that one dose should fit all patients, but I have read that many types of medications, although available in larger doses, do not necessarily work any better than a smaller dose. I think it is probably better to explore this with each patient and be honest about dosing rather than make a blanket statement when speaking to them. Take care, Annette""Please start a new thread as necessary. This one is three years old, it is way too much to expect folks to figure out who is responding to who, and go back and forth to figure this out. Just my opinion. Take care, Annette""DDD stands for Degenerative Disc Disease, a common spinal problem in most folks. It is one of my diagnoses. I have never had a bad experience with pain management, my pcp has always managed my pain for me, with the occasional consult from a specialist in pain management. I have had my current doctor for almost 15 years now. I do a certain amount of research before I see a doctor, so I usually know something about them ahead of time. I have been taking daily opioids since early in our relationship, I feel she takes good care of me. I stopped doing much makeup when I stopped working, but I always dress nicely and my hair is clean and tidy. I think most people actually feel better if they take normal steps to look good, whatever their age. I am 61 now. Who wants to look like crap? Not me. Take care, Annette""Even my lawyer told me to ""dress down"" and look like a vagabond at my SSDI hearing, I didn<APO>t then either. Good to see you. Take care, Annette""I do have a great primary care doc, and have had positive experiences with most doctors. It IS a real blessing. Take care, Annette""I am not MegElaine8, and this is just my opinion. Of course, opioids are nothing to mess around with. That said, methadone is not even close to ""legal heroin"", it is just another synthetic pain med. Withdrawals from opioids of any kind will not KILL an adult with no complicating health issues. If you have evidence based medical studies to the contrary, please post a link, I would be happy to go read about it. Anecdotal information is far less welcome. I have taken methadone for chronic pain for several years now, and worked my first job as an RN in a methadone clinic for heroin addicts in 1970, so it is safe to say I have been on both sides of this drug<APO>s uses. I have forgotten to take a dose, it never put me in the hospital. I fill a daily pill box with meds, so I am sure I have not ever missed more than the one dose. My husband has withdrawn from methadone twice while I have been living with him for 20 years, another opiate, oxycodone, twice also, he has never had withdrawal symptoms at all. Withdrawal symptoms are very individual, one person may have them, and another may not. I don<APO>t think it is the drug, I think it is the rate at which the doctor tapers the doses. I think you need to be aware of any drug you choose to use, and be very careful, and aware of all the alternatives. I believe that any kind of opioid should rarely if ever be the first choice for chronic pain management. They should be only one tool used for this complicated problem. Take care, Annette""There is no magic pill for losing weight, wish there was, lol. A class I went to suggested eating 100 calories less per day and exercising 100 calories more per day. That amounts to one less cookie a day for instance, and perhaps walking 30 minutes more per day. She said one would lose weight slowly but surely this way. I started belly dancing to instructional DVDs at home 2 or 3 years ago, I do one hour a day, (minimum) every day, except while on vacation for 10 days a year or so. No real dietary changes though. I have lost about 60 pounds this way. Very slowly, but it does seem to work. Eating better would help though... Take care, Annette""Methadone gets a bad reputation due to using it for heroin addiction. It was originally developed during WWII by the Germans because they did not have enough morphine for their injured troops. When I was in nursing school in 1970 we used it in a cocktail for folks with severe terminal pain. I worked in a heroin treatment facility after I graduated in 1970, methadone was considered experimental for the treatment of addiction at that time. It is just another long acting opioid. The main difference is that it is naturally long acting, not a short acting drug in a long acting delivery system. Be very careful, and take it as directed. No extra doses at all, you could easily overdose and die. It is old, and cheap, I may well be on it for many years to come. Take care, Annette""Opiates do not work for all kinds of pain, perhaps this is one of those cases. Take care, Annette""I am not sure what post you are referring to, no pain doctor<APO>s have asked me to come in without taking my meds, one would assume they would tell you that before you arrived at the clinic though. You are certainly correct about new doctor<APO>s treating you their way, not the way your old doctor did. Take care, Annette""I have done the same thing, no worries.""I am not Anon<UD>1379 I am Annette030. I don<APO>t know why it put that. Take care, Annette""I am sorry you had so much trouble with methadone. I don<APO>t know what was going on with you or why you ended up with so much trouble. I feel just as strongly that methadone, when prescribed by a doctor who knows what he is doing is a great drug. All opioid cessation will trigger withdrawal after chronic use, if the taper is not done properly, a longer taper in patients who have problems with the withdrawal symptoms is appropriate. There are non-opioid meds that one can take if necessary to help one through withdrawal. I do not ascribe to the belief that methadone destroys nerve fibers, or that it will take months to recover from using it. I worked in a methadone treatment program for opiate addicts many years ago, in the 70s. People on that program were on much higher doses than you were on, some up to 180 mg. a day. We were able to taper them off slowly without significant withdrawal symptoms. Many of those folk were working jobs by then and it usually did not cause them to even miss work. My husband was on it for nearly two years, and it did not cause any personality changes, he was able to continue working as a bug truck mechanic, and it helped a lot with his pain until he could get a hip replacement. Once he got that done and his pain was nearly gone, he tapered off of the methadone with no withdrawal symptoms at all. His doctor told us to take as long as we wanted to with his taper. I am an old nurse, and I put his meds in a weekly box for him. I did a pretty standard taper, I reduced his daily dose by half once a week, when he was down to 5 mg. twice a day, I reduced it to once a day for a week, then every other day for a week, then stopped it completely. He said he didn<APO>t even notice the changes. We started about two weeks after his surgery. He went back to work 8 weeks after surgery and he was off of the methadone by then. All drugs have their own set of side effects, including methadone. You will only know if it is a good drug for you by taking it. Apparently, it is not a good drug for you, and/or your doctor does not know how to prescribe it properly. Many doctors don<APO>t. I don<APO>t understand why, when you complained to your doctor about side effects, he would increase your dose. Every one responds differently to medicines, and every doctor has his own prescribing techniques. Not all conditions that cause chronic pain are curable. Many of them cause pain and the root of the pain cannot be fixed. So we must learn to deal with the pain. Some of us choose to use opioid meds as part of what we do to control our pain for the long term rather than the short term you mentioned. Many of us who choose to do so, do fine. I hope you are doing better and continue to do better. Take care, Annette""I use lidoderm patches as a part of my pain management plan. I am sure on their own, they would not work, but along with my other meds they do help. I didn<APO>t believe they would penetrate deeply enough, but they do. Every little bit helps. Aside from that, I would ask before you make an appt. if the doctors at that pain clinic manage oral meds long term as well as doing injections and procedures. You can go ahead and tell the person you speak to that you have already tried those and they didn<APO>t help. Tell them you are looking for a doctor who is willing to help you find the right drug combination for you. Do not tell them you are looking for opiates. I would look for a comprehensive pain management clinic, the more stuff they use the better off you may end up. I believe that if I get a bit of relief from each of several interventions, the total amount of relief is usually worthwhile. Take care, Annette""If you were taking suboxone for opiate addiction (its authorized indication), then the doctors are correct in not offering you opiates right away. If someone is in recovery from opiate abuse, they need to solidify that recovery with some time off of drugs before trying opiates for pain management. Some doctors would never use opiates for that patient because they don<APO>t feel comfortable doing so. Seeing a PM clinic that has an addictions specialist might be useful. Most doctors in my experience will always say they don<APO>t prescribe opiates for chronic pain. Otherwise, the addicts would all show up and that doctor would be spending most of his time weeding them out. If I like a doctor at the first visit, and feel like we could work well together, I put off the opiate question until the 3-4 visit. The first visit, I tell them frankly that I do take opiates, but I would never ask them to prescribe them unless they felt comfortable doing so. Usually by the 3-4 visit we know each other well enough to trust each other. They have always taken over my pain management by the 3-4 visit. Some PM clinics only do injections and procedures, they don<APO>t manage meds for anyone. Others do many different treatments including meds. It is not medically correct to go straight to opiates for chronic pain for any patient. You don<APO>t say why you were on suboxone, what your pain is caused by, or what other treatments you have tried already so it is difficult to offer much in the way of suggestions. Take care, Annette""I have read here that some doctors want to see their new patients in maximum pain, so they ask them to not take their meds for one appt. I have never had a doctor like that. But I do know they have to document what they see. If you go to apply for disability later you want that pain noted in your medical records, and they cannot document what they have never actually seen. If he is planning on giving you injections, he would surely need to see you in pain to make a proper assessment, and know where to inject the drugs. I do know that often doctors want to make their own judgements on a patient, and purposely do not speak to other doctors on the case until after they see the patient and make their own diagnosis. Then they speak to the other doctors if they have any questions about the records or the patient. It seems he would want to verify your diagnosis, before he injects you with cortisone. Take care, Annette""I do not agree with this at all. It is all about how fast the doctor tapers you off of any opiate. My husband tapered off of methadone with no withdrawal symptoms at all. He had been on it for two years and finally had a surgery that fixed his painful hip. I tapered him down slowly over about three or four weeks, the doc just told us to go slow and if he had any problems to call him. I kept asking him if there were any symptoms, and he said no. Years ago I worked at a methadone clinic for opiate addiction treatment where we did not even tell patients what their dose was. At times we tapered people off without even telling them until it was over. Back in those days, it was all experimental, and research was being done. Their dose was liquid and mixed in with juice. I have seen it, and it is not as big a deal as you make it out to be for most people. Take care, Annette""I have not found any randomized, double blind studies of various opioids that show any one drug is better for pain relief, or worse in side effects including withdrawal than another opioid. I really do not believe it is the drug, it is the patient or the doctor not prescribing it correctly. Watching some documentary made without those kinds of rigorously controlled studies is not much more than watching one person<APO>s opinion. In my experience both as a nurse and as a patient, methadone is not a drug that is used on opiate naive patients. I have not seen doctors go from no opiates straight to methadone either for pain or for addiction treatment. Take care, Annette""First of all, I worked at a methadone clinic for heroin addiction treatment from 1970 to about 1973 in California. My husband got methadone a few years ago from his family doctor here in Oregon for pain management, a whole different thing as far as dosing, etc. There was no connection professionally. You are absolutely correct, no one knows anything about anyone they meet on line. I am a nurse and a chronic pain patient. There is no way of proving that to anyone here on line. You and I disagree about withdrawing from different opiates, no big deal. We have different experiences. Take care, Annette""I think withdrawal symptoms are very individual. My husband tapered off of methadone after being on it for a couple of years. He had no withdrawal symptoms at all. I was there, so I know. Ditto with morphine many years ago when he came off of it, this according to him as I was not around then. He has also been on SSRIs, and SNRIs, and tapered off of those without withdrawals. I witnessed this also. I worked at a methadone clinic for folks with addiction problems many years ago (1970s), and in those days we did not tell clients their dose at all. We tapered people off without even telling them until it was over with, once their therapists decided it was time. Often they did not experience withdrawals. It is certainly possible to taper off of opiates very slowly and avoid significant withdrawal symptoms for some folks. Others will have withdrawal symptoms. No one should attempt to taper off a drug of any kind without their doctor<APO>s supervision. Take care, Annette""Do you keep a journal of some sort? Or do you fill out the assessment tools from memory? My pcp manages my chronic pain and has done very well for me. Take care, Annette""Hi, Rockygirl First a minor comment, there is no reason why you have to take any medicine just because the doctor writes you a RX for it. If you don<APO>t feel the oxycodone does any good anymore, tell your doctor you want to taper off of it. Don<APO>t ask him or mention it casually, request a taper and if he hands you the same old RX, hand it back and tell him you wanted to taper off, ""can he write you instructions on how to do it?"", then repeat yourself if necessary. I gave up driving a stick years ago due to neck problems that made my right arm hurt too much. An automatic is much better for me. Maybe when your car wears out, you can try one. I don<APO>t think it is reasonable to ask a patient to stop taking their pain meds prior to a first appt. No point in going through withdrawals AND being in pain, what if you and this doctor don<APO>t even like each other? After you meet, the two of you can decide what to do about tapers. No internist would ask a pt. to stop their BP med to see how high there BP was without them. Nice to have you here, always good to get another point of view. Take care, Annette""Did your doctor prescribe it to be taken only if you had a headache and needed it, or on a daily basis? I have seen other drugs in this same class of meds used to treat migraines, indeed I have used them for that myself. But always as a daily scheduled med. I would be interested in how your doctor is prescribing them. I have only seen it prescribed on a daily basis, so people who are taking it that way, may have higher blood levels and thus have more likelihood of having side effects. Once a medication is approved by the FDA and is available for general use, doctors are allowed to prescribe it any way they want to, and often find other uses, and ways of using it, than it was originally approved for. Take care, Annette""I search on Medscape or one of the other sites that doctors use for medical research. Use Google as a starting point if necessary, but you have to wade through a lot of commercial sites to find the studies. Large studies are better than small one statistically. I ask my doctor or pharmacist, they have been very useful about providing links to articles. Ask people here, Charles is great about providing links when he has them available. Take care, Annette""I am sorry, I had this new drug mixed up with another new drug that is dosed once a day, every day. I Googled this drug on the site of the maker of the drug, and it says it is to be dosed every 4-6 hours as needed. I had read this before I posted last time in this thread. I should have remembered. I like to see how well new drugs do over about five years. This is the period when side effects first come out. I would be happy to hear how well it works out for you, especially in the long run. My best migraine remedy works about 85% of the time over many years of use. Take care, Annette""I had one new doctor (pcp) suggest it to me one time years ago. I declined and explained how pain management worked to him, and said I would be glad to continue to get my pain meds from my rheumy. And I did. Three visits later, after he did some reading of his own, he apologized and offered to take over prescribing my opiates so I wouldn<APO>t have to drive so far to get the RXs. I passed, I really liked my rheumy and he was happy to give me my meds. We all got along fine after that. Take care, Annette""Not every medicine works well for every person, no matter how you take it. I am so glad it is working well for you and your dad. Best of luck to you both. Take care, Annette""Convulsions are not a part of opioid withdrawal, please see a doctor if you actually had a seizure as opposed to the shakes. Take care, Annette""I<APO>ve read this book. Although it is very helpful for many folks, it is not a cure all for everyone. I would add his techniques to ones other treatment therapies, and then see how things go. If you can wean off of meds, with your doctors guidance, fine. No one should be made to feel like a failure if it does not work however. Take care, Annette""If you can stay off the percocet for awhile, it may go back to helping you as it did before. By not taking it for awhile, your tolerance to it might be gone. Take care, Annette""I have a personal rule not to try any new meds until they have been widely prescribed for at least five years, and no weird side effects have happened to those who did try it. That said, if you don<APO>t feel strange taking a fairly new drug, then have an open mind and give it a try, some people do very well on it, others don<APO>t. I feel it is always better to at least try non-opiate drugs with a good record before going down the opiate path. If it doesn<APO>t work for you, you will at least have started to establish a good relationship with this new doctor as a patient who is cooperative and tries things. Take care, Annette""I took several kinds of meds at one time that included serotonin reuptake inhibition effects. My doctor explained what Serotonin Syndrome was and educated me on the beginning symptoms, and left it up to me as to whether I wanted to try the new med. Serotonin Syndrome is fairly rare and I gave the new med a try. I took it for around six months without any problems, and stopped taking it for unrelated issues. I never developed Serotonin Syndrome at all. There is a difference between mixing drugs with caution and not mixing them at all due to interactions. I opted to do it with caution. You might speak to your pharmacist. Take care, Annette""Pharmaceutical reps are drug salesmen, it is their job to push drugs on doctors, they usually give them the pep talk as to how great their drug is, and often minimize the side effects. They really push the positive points of a drug. If you haven<APO>t already spoken to your doctor, please do so as soon as you can. Take care, Annette""120 mg. three times a day is a large dose of methadone no matter how you look at it. I hope you are aware of the QTprolongation problems noted with methadone, particularly doses of over 60 mg. per day. This is causing Torsades in some patients. Do your research, so you know what your risks are. One or two studies I read said this could happen even with low doses of methadone. I am also an RN, no longer working, and my doctor suggests getting EKGs yearly as long as I am on methadone. I only take 20 mg. per day. I hope you are doing so. Do you mean methylphenidate? It is a central nervous system stimulant approved for ADHD and narcolepsy symptoms. If you have ADHD or narcolepsy that is one thing, but no way would I ever take a CNS stimulant with an opioid to relieve the opioids sedative effect. I remember the 1960s and the uppers and downers prescribed by doctors got a lot of people in trouble. Take care, Annette""I am glad he is home and hope he has recovered. Although serotinin syndrome is rare it does happen. I have met doctors and patients who kept adding new drugs, without even considering stopping some of the older ones. I think it is a bad idea myself, especially if it is for side effects of drugs you are already on. Thanks for the warning. Take care, Annette""If you have tried Nucynta already and you didn<APO>t like it, why are you trying it again? Is the doctor trying a different dose or something? Oxycontin IS oxycodone, it is exactly the same drug. The only difference is oxycodone can be given in a short acting formula or the long acting version in Oxycontin. You may have been under-dosed when you took Oxycontin before. You may prefer the short acting version, but it is the same drug. You are more likely to become addicted to a short acting drug than a long acting one used properly simply because you are more likely to get a high from the short acting kind. Your blood levels bounce up and down, rather than maintaining a steady level. I really believe that almost anyone can be tapered off of an opiate slowly enough to avoid withdrawal symptoms, it is all about the slow taper. Anyone with chronic pain will likely get the pain back, but that is not the same as withdrawal. I worked in a methadone clinic for drug addicts back in the 1970s, and in those days we didn<APO>t tell people what their dose was or when we changed it. Times have changed now, it was still experimental for addiction back then. We used to taper clients off all the time without them even knowing their dose was being decreased. They had no withdrawal symptoms at all when we did a really slow taper. Their doses were much higher than what is currently used for pain management. Everyone will go through withdrawal if they come off all of a sudden, that is different. Good luck with your coming surgery. Take care, Annette""I am sorry that you had such a bad time with this especially on a weekend. Was your doctor available by phone to help you at least? I make it a practice to never start a new medicine until it has been widely prescribed for at least five years. This brings out any weird side effects that may happen. Most drugs that are recalled are usually recalled within that time frame. It does not surprise me that there are problems with a new drug anymore. Drug companies are allowed to just not publish any studies that show problems with a new drug, so there is no way for the consumer to know about them until it becomes public knowledge. Be sure to report this to the adverse event department of the drug company that makes it. I know when we are in pain it is hard not to just try anything to get relief. I looked it up when this was first posted, and it was sounded like an opiate/tramadol type drug with a norepinepherine reuptake inhibitor, all in one. I have tried the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors before and they didn<APO>t help my pain at all, so this one didn<APO>t look very promising to me when I read about it. I hope you are feeling better. Love you, Annette""Tell the doctor about your GI problems with opiates. A good bowel care program is essential for anyone on chronic opiates. Preventing constipation is far easier than fixing it after it has happened. A stimulant type laxative is usually necessary as the opiates tend to stop the functional action of the bowels that pushes the feces through and out of the body. A stool softener may be fine at the beginning, but some kind of stimulant is often needed as time goes on. Most doctors have their own favorite bowel programs that they prefer, so just ask him exactly what to try and how. I don<APO>t think Nucynta will prove to be any kind of miracle drug. I personally do not try any new drugs until they have been widely used for at least five years. I feel that it takes about that long to actually find out what side effects they cause and how well they work. Many people are willing to try them earlier, I believe it is a personal decision to make. Take care, Annette""I have tried antidepressant meds in the past (ten years or so ago). They gave me terrible side effects, and I won<APO>t take them anymore. They never gave me significant relief anyway. My personal rule is that I will NOT try any new meds until they have been approved AND widely prescribed for at least FIVE years. Then I look at the side effect profile and make a decision. Many new drugs do not do what the marketing people claim they do. These are sales people who are out to make money, not care for people. I do not believe that Nucynta has been out long enough for me to even consider it. I have never used either Savella or Nucynta. I believe they are related to the SNRI antidepressants, look them up and see what the possible side effects are and decide if you want to try them. Nucynta has additional drug in it that I think works kind of like tramadol, I am not sure about this med at all. I would rather take older drugs that have gone generic and whose side effects are already well known. There is NO drug that will cure FMS, so if your doc is saying this he is likely just repeating what the sales person said to him. I found a doctor who is willing to accept that I won<APO>t even try newer drugs and is happy to let me decide what chemicals to put in my own body. She offers what she thinks might help me, and is willing to let me decide if I wish to try it or not. I waited on the neurontin for many years after she offered it. I finally did decide to try it and it has been very helpful for me, with little to no side effects. She never even said, ""I told you so."" Levorphanol is one of those old drugs that can work very well for many people. I am glad you found it and it works for you. Take care, Annette""I have taken the ""evil drug"" morphine and now I am on methadone, but at far, far less than Jay is. I think it is up to the individual, but really they are all pretty much the same. I only switched because the methadone is far cheaper and I am on Medicare now and wish to avoid the dreaded donut hole. I found them all pretty much the same. There are no medical studies that I know of that show any one opioid is better or safer than another. I believe it is all in the dosing and timing. Methadone is naturally long acting, so it is true you can skip a dose without going into withdrawals, but I could skip a dose of MS Contin and not go into withdrawals either. I just asked my doctor for methadone because it is cheaper. I explained to her how I would like to switch over and she was willing to work with me to do that. I did and I am very happy with it. I would not change drugs unless I had a good reason to, if everything is going great, I would stick with what I am doing. I was on MS Contin for over ten years without any problems. Take care, Annette""I would definitely refuse to have a repeat set of injections if I had already done that and it didn<APO>t help. Doesn<APO>t make sense to me to repeat it, but maybe someone knows more than I do about these injections. I am 59 and was told over ten years ago that I had the cervical spine of a ninety year old. Bad DDD with herniations, spurs, etc. I had one discectomy about 18 years ago when the function of my hands were affected. I didn<APO>t have a lot of pain at that time. I also have a long history of migraines, no aura though. For me, any loss of sleep increases my pain levels. I have found that I just had to keep experimenting with meds to find the right ones. My old doctor and I finally just stopped all the meds and started over. I took ambien for sleep and Norco (generic) for pain. After I moved, I added neurontin and a long acting pain med, first just at night, then 24/7. I have been using that basic formula for many years now, it works for me, but it may not for you. I tried antidepressants of many kinds years ago and they make me worse, not better. Occasionally, my doctor and I have tried other things, but they didn<APO>t help so we stopped them. I guess I would keep a log of what you do and what your pain levels are each day, include your meds, dose and times. Show it to your doctor and ask him what he would suggest you try differently to make things better. Tell him specific goals that you would like to be able to do with better pain control. If he can<APO>t help you, ask him to refer you to someone who can. Take care, Annette""It sounds like because of the probation officer you will be forced to be honest with your doctor, that is a good thing for you in the long run, but it might be tougher for the short term. Some pain management doctors have associates that manage addiction in patients who need it, and it sounds like that might be helpful for you. I don<APO>t know if your new pain management doctor does that or not, you will have to see when you talk to him. You may need to detox off of the heroin just to find out what your pain levels are now that you got your clavicle fixed. Then you and your doctor can assess the pain you do have and decide how best to handle it. Opiates may not be the answer for you at this time. There may be other treatments that work better for you. MRI results are not accurate predictors of pain. This is a big challenge for you, best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""I wouldn<APO>t bother with this drug either, because it is so close chemically to other drugs I have taken that did not work. I really believe that most drugs are truly tested for side effects the first five years they are widely prescribed after being approved. That is why I won<APO>t even try anything until that time has passed. Many of use will take a drug for many years, and most ""long term "" studies for adverse effects only last a year. To be approved it seems like a drug only has to work better than a placebo and not kill anyone in the testing process. That said, I don<APO>t bother to read the WebMD reviews on drugs. I want to see real double blind studies. The problem with reviews is that people who had a bad experience are much more likely to take the time to go and write about it than someone who had a good experience. You also cannot tell if they just happened to have the flu, migraines, or some other illness at the time they started the med and that was the problem rather than side effects of the drugs. Just my thoughts. Take care, Annette""I think you may be mixing up addiction, dependence, and side effects, or I may be completely misunderstanding what you are saying. Addiction is a psychological problem where someone uses a drug compulsively for other than its intended use and in spite of the negative consequences on ones life. Tramadol does not cause a buzz or a high in most people, so an addiction is rare. People take it for pain, not to get high, which is where most addicts get into trouble with a drug. Dependence means that a person will have some kind of withdrawal syndrome if a drug is stopped abruptly. Tramadol can cause dependence in some people. The solution to that is that one simply tapers off the drug slowly. Many drugs in many different classifications cause dependence, including antidepressants, which happens to be a part of this new drug Nucynta also. Side effects are things that happen while you are taking a drug, not after you are off of it. You described nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, gall bladder pain, and dizziness as happening while one is on the drug. All of these but gall bladder pain and diarrhea are mentioned in my drug handbook as side effects of tramadol. Unlike you, I took tramadol for many years and had NO side effects at all, and NO withdrawal at all when I stopped taking it. Not a bit of nausea or vomiting. I found 100 mg. of it worked about as well as one vicodin for pain. I also found it seemed to make my morning dose of long acting morphine last a bit longer and work a bit better than when I took it alone. I took it for about 8 years, and stopped every once in a while to see if I was imagining things, but I always did worse without it than with it painwise, so I would go back to it. I finally stopped a couple of years ago when I changed long acting opiates. Tramadol also gave me more energy after I took it, which seems to be fairly common in folks with FMS. I couldn<APO>t take it later in the day because it kept me awake. That was just my experience, other people may have other experiences with it. A drug similar to tramadol, not tramadol, is mixed with an antidepressant type drug to make Nucynta. So, someone who reacted to tramadol may not react to Nucynta, or they might. It is a crap shoot. Personally, I can<APO>t take antidepressants due to bad side effects, so I have not even tried it. Nucynta may be a great drug, I don<APO>t know. My own practice is that I won<APO>t even try a new drug until it has been widely prescribed for at least five years to see how people DO react to it. I feel that the studies done by drug companies are inadequate for long term side effects. The real side effects are discovered when the public takes these drugs for a while. Take care, Annette""I also started taking neurontin for FMS pain. I discovered my migraines almost went away completely, I rarely have one anymore. It helped with the FMS pain, irritable bowel, and irritable bladder symptoms as well. It is my own wonder drug, lol. It may not work as well for other people, but I love it. Take care, Annette""Read my reply to Medecinewomon above regarding tramadol. We don<APO>t have the same experience with tramadol. I am more concerned about the cardiovascular effects of Nucynta, several folks on another board have commented on heart rate and BP changes due to this drug. I have taken many serotonergic drugs for migraines and FMS, and never found any of them to cause withdrawal. Some people do complain about withdrawals from antidepressants, but I had none, my son had none, and my husband had none. Take care, Annette""I went to the Nucynta website after Googling it, and they do claim it has an effect on serotonin. One component of it is an SNRI or NSRI, which means it inhibits the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine, like an antidepressant. The other component is the drug that acts directly on pain and may be similar to tramadol. Maybe it would be useful for folks thinking about taking it to read there to findout exactly what is in it, and read other places to find out more than drug companies are willing to tell us, lol. Take care, Annette""You are absolutely correct. I went back and reread the company<APO>s website. It is one drug with two separate effects. I thought it was an SNRI and a new pain med combined, but it says that it is one drug that has two effects, as you said. I read recently in a nursing journal that the drug company is making a long acting version, and awaiting FDA approval. They tried to show that dextromethorphan would help with pain and decease the need for opiates some years ago. I am not sure what the final results were, but they don<APO>t seem to be prescribing it. Good to see you again. Take care, Annette""Where did you get the information about all those drugs being in the Duragesic patch? As far as I know the Duragesic Patch only contains fentanyl. This is according to my drug manual for advanced practice nurses. Take care, Annette""Once you have surgery this doctor will probably not be taking care of your meds anyway. I would make sure you have a pain management team in the hospital or that the surgeon plans on continuing your fentanyl patches until after the pain from your surgery goes away. At that point tapering off the fentanyl might be appropriate. If the surgery does not fix your back pain, and it may not, then you will probably go to a pain management doctor for pain control. He will decide with you whether to continue the fentanyl or try something else. If you feel positive about the surgery and this surgeon, then do what you need to do. I am so sorry that you had to go through all that, I have no idea if it was the doctor<APO>s fault or the nurse<APO>s fault, or just one of those things that happens sometimes. I hope the doctor<APO>s office redoes their protocols and procedures to prevent it from happening to anyone else. Take care, Annette""I believe that they can however put the current date at the top of the RX, then write ""Do not fill until<UD><UD><UD><UD>"" in the body of the RX. Take care, Annette""$150 a month sounds pretty steep to me. Especially with no insurance. In the old days, my husband had a car repair shop next door to the local hospital, and he provided free care repair and maintenance to doctors in exchange for free medical care for him and his employees. It worked out great for doctors<APO> care, he had primary care and all the specialties covered. He only had to buy insurance for major medical hospital care for his employees. My insurance company pays my doctor $70 per visit and I pay $30 per visit as a co-pay. I only see her once every 2-3 months. She spends whatever amount of time I need for that visit, no rushing. I rarely need to see my doctor more than once every 2-3 months, I would hate to pay $150 every month, even when I don<APO>t see her. It is true that we pay more than that in insurance premiums, but my insurance also pays for meds, labs, xrays, hospitalization, etc. I vote for single payer, universal coverage for everyone, get rid of all the blood sucking insurance companies, but I doubt I will see that in my lifetime. More doctors are doing the concierge type care that you are talking about, they limit the number of patients to what they can handle alone. Then figure out what they must charge them per month to pay their own upkeep. The doctor<APO>s family life would suffer though, especially if they are on-call 24/7. Take care, Annette""This is one of those times when it just depends on what you need. I don<APO>t need the same kind of care that you do and I am happy with my current doctor. She doesn<APO>t rush me and she has always been available for me. Our current system of health care is fine for those with money, but not for those without. The US is far behind other Western countries in all the markers of health care success, things like accessibilty to care, infant mortality, age at time of death, etc. If other countries<APO> governments can run health care so can ours. I have no complaint about the police dept., fire dept and many other entities run by the government. (Of course, they might be better if they ran them my way, lol.) The current system is broken and does not work, and gets more expensive every year. Take care, Annette""I believe that we need to get rid of all for-profit insurance companies and provide universal health care for all citizens. Insurance companies are just middle men that take our money to pay our doctors, and keep a hefty percentage for their shareholders. It is their job to deny care so they can make a higher level of profit. Having dozens of different insurance companies would be necessary for competition to bring policy premiums down, but that just makes for more paperwork for the providers. A billing office in the US for a mid to large sized hospital has dozens of employees, the same size hospital in a single payer country might have 3-4 employees because the paper work is all the same, and they know they will be paid. I don<APO>t believe that poor people should have to depend on the charity of other Americans to get health care. I have volunteered at free clinics in the past that provide health care and it is a very poor substitute for a family doctor. I believe that health care should be as much a right to all Americans as is a K-12th grade education. We can do it. If other countries can do it, so can we. We do not have to repeat the mistakes our government may have made in other agencies, we could do the best we can to begin with, and then improve any areas that need it as we go along. If we keep on waiting to make the change until someone comes up with what everyone agrees will be the ""perfect plan"", many people will die for lack of any health care at all. Take care, Annette""I would carefully read the labels. I assume the Opana ER 20 mg. that you take twice a day, is on a set schedule??? It is a long acting opiate and that is how they are usually prescribed. The roxicodone 30 mg. is a short acting opiate that is usually prescribed for one to take a specific number of pills, on an ""as needed"" basis every so many hours. Is that how yours is written? For instance, ""Take 1-2 pills every 6 hours as needed for pain"". This would be used for breakthrough pain that the Opana ER does not relieve. If that is how they are written, you would start taking the Opana ER 20 mg. twice a day on a set schedule, say 8 am and 8 pm. Then IF you have pain your would add the Roxicodone 30 mg. per your doctors instructions. You may find you won<APO>t need the same number of pills of Roxicodone as you did before, you may well need less as the Opana ER kicks in. If you do it this way, you should not have any trouble. You shouldn<APO>t go into withdrawal, as you can still take the total daily amount of roxicodone that you were already taking in addition to the Opana ER, and you should not overdose as long as you only take the roxicodone when you are having breakthrough pain. If your doctor said to take it some other way, be sure to follow his directions carefully. If you are not sure of his instructions, call the office and ask them to fax the directions to you, or discuss it with your pharmacist. I know it is always scary when you change over to a knew medication regimen, but this one looks okay to me. Take care, Annette""The above response was to Kimba2222, not ""nomorepain82"". I am not sure what happened with the heading. Take care, Annette""I think terminology may be different from place to palce. Where I come from quitting an opiate ""cold turkey"" means to stop that drug and not replace it with another opiate, and just go through withdrawals. When one changes from one opiate to another, it is normal to start at a lower dose of the new drug and adjust it as needed. This is because there is only a partial cross tolerance from one opiate to another. If you took a full equianalgesic dose of the new drug, you could overdose. The advantage of changing opiates is this partial cross tolerance, that means a lower dose of the new drug should work. After you start on the lower dose of the new drug, it is common to have to adjust that dose up or down until you have no withdrawal and your pain is controlled. I can<APO>t agree or disagree with your pharmacist, because I do not have all the information I need. I would use whatever kind of break through meds you use to help control your pain until the long acting med (Opana) is adjusted properly. Work with your doctor and your pharmacist on this, I am sure you will work it out. It might take a week or two to change over and find the right dose. Take care, Annette""I think that opiates should make one more functional, not less. Are you still doing your usual activities, chores, etc.? Or are you ""nodding out"" on the couch all day? I think it may be time for you to sit down with your doctor and your husband and work out a med schedule and a dose that works better for you. You should have better pain relief, and you should not be ""nodding out"" and acting drunk. Often, the input of a family member is helpful to the doctor in figuring out what to do to best help the patient. Take care, Annette""I am sorry, but two years later you are not still having withdrawal symptoms. Opiate withdrawal simply does not last that long. I have no doubt you are sensitive to heat if you say you are. But, it is not from the fentanyl. I have never heard of being heat sensitive as even being an opiate withdrawal symptom. Lots of people who are going through opiate withdrawal actually use heating pads to prevent the muscle cramps that are a part of withdrawal. The doctor giving you that prescription sounds like he didn<APO>t have a clue as to what he was doing, but that is no reason for someone with an expert doctor not to try a drug that might help them. like you mentioned, we all respond to meds differently. I am glad to hear you found a regimen that works for you. Take care, Annette""Where can I find medical research that shows any kind of opioid withdrawal that lasts for many years afterward? What site do you use on line that has the drug precautions highlighted in red? I use a drug handbook for advanced practice nursing. I like it because it breaks down side effects on many of the drugs into the percentage of user who has them. It gives me much more info to use than just saying a drug can cause dry mouth, if it tells me that less than 1% of users get dry mouth. I use Lidoderm patches, I discovered them on line at this site. Another member explained how she used them. They are VERY expensive, even with my insurance. I find these work well on localized pain, but not on wide spread pain which I also have. I think it is always wise to use many different things for pain relief. Take care, Annette""The Lidoderm patches work well for me. I cut them up into pieces and stick them anywhere I have localized pain. That makes them go farther. My insurance will cover brand name drugs like this, but the copay is the max that they charge so when I finally end up on Medicare, I don<APO>t know what will happen. At this point I am covered on my hubby<APO>s work insurance, but he is leaving work, and we are deciding between COBRA for the next 8 months, or both of us going on Medicare. I haven<APO>t read all the papers yet, but there is a government program that covers a lot of the COBRA cost if you are laid off. It might come out cheaper than Medicare for both of us at this point. He is old enough for Medicare, and I am disabled so we both qualify. It was such a relief when he was finally old enough to get Medicare. It meant our insurance was no longer tied to his job. It gives us options. Does insurance cover compounded RX creams, or do you have to pay for them yourself? How many points on the pain scale do they bring your pain down? I see my pcp on Monday, and am considering switching long acting opiates. I have been on morphine for about 12 years now. I am considering switching to methadone. It works slightly differently. I am thinking maybe I would get better relief with a new drug. If not, I can always go back. Take care of yourself. Hugs, Annette"I got the papers first. To get the government discounts so they will get us the best possible combination shot of getting it ."I think the nodding out will pass as you adjust to the med increase. If it does not, tell your doctor and ask him what to do about it. I would not worry about withdrawal from any opioids. That can be handled by tapering off of the meds slowly. There are also other meds that can be used to help you with any withdrawal symptoms you do have. This is really a non-issue that people tend to worry about. A medically supervised withdrawal from opiates is not difficult to do at all. My friend was on methadone and another opiate for BT use for two years. When he finally was able to have his hip replaced and the cause of his pain was gone, he easily tapered off of the methadone with NO withdrawal effects at all. If you have any questions at all, take them to your doctor, he sounds well able to discuss these things with you. Take care, Annette""One should never wear a sling unless the doctor tells you to wear it and you are shown how to fit it correctly. You can end up with elbow problems from wearing a sling, the joint can lock up and it can cause damage in the joint. If the hand is not supported correctly you can end up with damage to the wrist. Discuss this with your doctor and ask him if it is a good idea for you, and how to fit it properly, how long to wear it at one time, etc. Take care, Annette""Fentanyl is more potent than the other opioids when compared mg. for mg.. However, it is actually dosed in tinier amounts, micrograms compared to milligrams of the other meds like morphine or oxycontin. When the doses are adjusted to appropriate levels for each drug, the effects are very comparable. I am unaware of any good studies that show any one opioid is consistently better than another for pain control, or worse as far as side effects go for that matter. In randomized, double blind studies, they all seem to work as well as each other when dosed appropriately. If anyone knows of any randomized, double blind studies testing opioids head to head, I would be happy to read them. Fentanyl transdermal has the benefits of less frequent dosing. This is important to many people. It has its drawbacks also. Soma is recommended to be prescribed 350 mg. 3-4 times a day. So if he is taking less than 1,000 mg. a day, he is well within the suggested dosing limits. This is not a drug I would take or recommend, but many others disagree and think it works great for them. Muscle relaxants are commonly prescribed to work with the opioid to bring down pain levels even if there are not significant muscle spasms. I take a different one, baclofen, when my pain levels go way up due to a flare, rather than increase my opioids. The muscle relaxant potentiates the opioid. Kind of like 2+2=6 for pain relief. There are some other types of drugs that are also used to potentiate opioids to get better pain control. I agree that being prescribed two short acting opioids is unusual, but I am not clear that he is to take them both at once. My doctor prescribed two for me, I am to take the one that seems appropriate at the time. I don<APO>t take them together, I take one or the other. But, I have both on hand. One thing that Charles and I always agree on is that everyone should discuss these things with their doctors, and not change their treatment plan alone based on what they read here. Take care, Annette""Your postings say in many ways that you are not functioning on these meds. You can<APO>t ""keep a thought in your head"" beyond a couple of seconds, you have missed so much work you have been laid off, you can no longer do the activities that you used to be able to do and enjoy, etc. Print out this whole thread and take it to your doctor. Discuss with him other options for managing your pain. Just because your pain is under control, does not mean you are functioning. I would see the shrink and see the doctor who is managing your pain meds. Take care, Annette""If you have never had anything like this happen before, where you had to ask for an early refill or a replaced RX, the doctor may write you another one. Some doctors are very strict about lost RXs and may not rewrite it and make you go until it was due. If so try to find out as soon as possible so you can stretch your other meds as long as possible. Many doctors treat RXs like cash, if you lose it, you lose it. The bank won<APO>t replace lost cash, and some doctors won<APO>t replace lost RXs. But most will give you one error. Call the office and explain what happened, they may want you to see the doctor and explain face to face. Don<APO>t ever let it happen again though. Doctors hate to hear it more than once. Take care, Annette""In my state they are supposed to ask for a photo ID, but my pharmacy never does, perhaps because I have been going there for so long. You might consider buying a home safe or even a tackle box with a lock for your meds. It is safer than anything else at home. It keeps the thieves and children from getting into your meds. Never keep them in the bathroom medicine cabinet. I would not allow anyone in my home that I did not trust. I am too old for that anymore. Take care, Annette""Doctors can and do write the exact same RX to replace a lost one. The only problem is if someone fills the ""lost"" RX and the new one. There is no law about replacing a lost RX, it is up to the doctor. This does happen with drug abusers, usually. I worked as an RN in ERs and hospitals for many years and have heard every trick in the book. When I first got out of school in 1970, I worked at a drug treatment facility with heroin addicts. I got my education about these things early on. Take care, Annette""Unfortunately, not all states have computerized data bases for controlled substances. I live in one that does not, but I wish it did. I feel it makes it easier on the legit patients in the long run. There is no one place for doctors here to call and find out if a ""lost"" RX had been filled or not. It will be good when this is done in all states, not just here and there. Take care, Annette""Please ask your doctor when you see him for the name of the study/ies and the authors names so we can read them ourselves. It would be important who paid for the study, how many people took part, how they were chosen to participate, if it was a randomized, double blind study, etc. He only seems to have brought up oxycodone products, it the problem only with this drug, or with all opiates? Thanks for posting, will look forward to hearing from you again. Take care, Annette""I am glad you have found the right path for you to follow at this time in your life. I wish you continued progress with your meds. I hope you find the level that works for you, whether that is the amount you take now or none at all. Take care, Annette""I am so sorry that your holidays went the way they did. As an RN, it has always been my fear that I would someday get RSD or trigeminal neuralgia, because these two chronic pain conditions are so difficult to treat successfully. I can<APO>t believe your son has gone through medical school and still thinks RSD is all in your head. That is just crazy!! Even when I went to nursing school in 1968-70 we were taught that it was a physical condition. I think the holidays bring out the worst in many people, unfortunately, this seems to have happened with your son. After all your hard work to make the holiday so nice for everyone, his behaviour is unacceptable. I went to my son and DIL<APO>s home for 14 days over the holidays. I got to spend time with and spoil my two grandsons. I always push myself to the edge when I go there so my DIL can get some rest. She works full time, goes to school part time and takes care of the house and kids. My son works full time and has a long commute, he helps with the house and the kids, but you and I know that the women bear the brunt of that job in most cases. Maybe I am a bit of a sexist, lol. I make cookies every couple of days, clean house, and do all the laundry. I cooked and put several batches of stew in the freezer. We took down the Xmas tree and decorations on Sunday night. They go away to a friend<APO>s place a few hours away for New Year<APO>s Eve, I didn<APO>t want her to have to do anything after work this week to get ready. All she will have to do is pack and they can go. She calls me her ""Xmas Elf"" because I go and do stuff to make life easier for her. Her mom passed away some time ago, and only her dad came for Xmas dinner. Most of the rest of her family lives far away. I am very lucky in that she and my son are very caring and appreciative of everything I do for them. They try and take good care of me, when I will let them. I know that it will take me several weeks to recover, and I am willing to do that once a year. I wish they lived closer to us so we could see each other more often, but maybe the distance makes us more appreciative of each other. I don<APO>t know. I just got back and turned on my email digests today. So, I am back online reading again. I don<APO>t do any computer stuff at all when I am gone on vacation. God bless you, you do have friends here. I know that does not help in this situation, but hopefully your son will come around. Please do not make decisions about whether or not you are speaking at this point. Give it all some time. Perhaps as he grows and matures as a doctor he will understand better. Hugs, Annette""You are such a sweet heart. I end up with about a week or two of increased pain once I get home, and then the fatigue sets in. But it is so worth it. I am lucky, my husband of 20 years is so supportive. When I get home he does all the cooking and encourages me to rest and relax. I hope the coming new year brings all of us some relief from our pain, and a better perspective on life. The economy also could better for all of us. Hugs, Annette""I would check with your pharmacist and ask if there are any interactions with your present meds. That said, in my experience as a nurse, people quit when they decide that is what they really want to do. Also most people quit more than one time. The odds get better each time they quit that they will stay smoke free. The studies I have read about quitting say that using the nicotene patch along with an oral pill increases your odds of quitting successfully, but not by much. Two of my friends who each smoked more than 2 PPD for over 35 years quit by using the patches. One of them took a smoking quitters class at Kaiser about six weeks prior to actually quitting. She shared her knowledge with her sister who quit about 6 months later. Both have been successful and have not smoked for many years now. Both found after using the patches for 2 weeks, they simply forgot to apply a new patch one day and figured why bother. My son used to smoke while deployed overseas and then quit when he got home without much difficulty. After his third deployment (Afghanistan, Iraq invasion, and Iraq occupation) he found it VERY difficult to quit when he got home. This last time he tried the patches for a few days, but did not like how they made him feel. He finally just quit cold turkey. I really believe the motivation to quit comes from within, and any aids you use may make it seem easier, but really don<APO>t make much difference. As someone who lost both parents to smoking related lung cancer, I really hope you find a way to quit smoking. Use ALL kinds of aids, from drugs to classes and support groups. Whatever it takes. The best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""I am glad you are getting some attention. I am sorry it requires getting an advocate involved, but do whatever it takes. Thank you for your service. Take care, Annette""Teresa and Gail have lots of good advice. I would add that you should never ask questions over the phone, make an appt. with the doctor and go in and ask him directly. Playing phone tag and going through nurses or others with messages is ineffective and does not get you the best care possible. My son has VA care for many of his problems due to service in the Marines in Afghanistan and Iraq. He uses the Loma Linda VA in southern Calif. and has had fair to good care through them. I have found over the years in three states as a RN that much of the problems seem to depend on where you go for VA care. Some places are definitely better than others in their reputation in the medical community and from listening to vets. It is a shame that that seems to be the case. Take care, Annette""Buspar is an anti-anxiety med. I looked it up to be certain. It is not a beta blocker and not a heart drug. I also looked up primidone, it is an anticonvulsant/barbiturate used for seizures. Her doctor gave it to her for her muscle jerking while working her up for seizures, at least that is what I understood from her post. Take care, Annette""If you feel your PCP has no clue, perhaps it is time to consider finding a new one. One must have confidence in their PCP in order to work well together. I am not sure what all your current meds are or if they could be interacting badly with each other. I might suggest you take a bag with ALL your current meds to your pharmacist and ask him/her to make sure they all work well together. Take care, Annette""The way I heard about it was that the stomach stops emptying its contents into the intestine when you get a migraine, and most of the meds we take for migraines are absorbed in the intestine, not in the stomach. I found a far cheaper and very good solution to this. I take reglan 10 mg. along with aspirin 975 mg. or ibuprofen 800 mg. at the start of a migraine. The reglan makes the medicine go from the stomach to the intestine where it actually works. It cures the nausea and the headache for me, and works far more consistently than the imitrex does. It is so cheap, reglan is an old drug with few side effects. I don<APO>t get sleepy at all, so I can continue with my daily activities. Talk to your doctor about any drug change. Take care, Annette""Don<APO>t forget, any pain killer, even the over-the-counter ones, can cause rebound headaches if taken more than three days a week. Taking more than the recommended amount of excedrine can cause liver damage or bleeding in the stomach. It is far safer to see your doctor and try other meds. If the excedrine does not work in the proper dosage, you need to see your doctor. Take care, Annette""My drug handbook states that Roxicodone is available in a 30 mg. tablet without any acetaminophen or aspirin added to it, only oxycodone. This book is from 2005, things may have changed since then. As far as I know, hydrocodone is only available in a dose as high as 10 mg. per pill along with acetaminophen in varying doses. I have used a generic of Norco 10/325 for about twenty years now, and my doctor just tells me to take one or two tablets as needed every four hours. Take care, Annette""I am glad to hear you have found a combination that works well for you. Take care, Annette""I have to wonder about using a total of 12 fentoras per day. It seems like it would make more sense to use a higher dose of your long acting med. Everything I have read about BT meds say that one should only be using them1-2 times per day. I understand some leeway there, but 12 per day sounds like too much to me. Just my opinion. No drugs are free, someone has to pay for them. Take care, Annette""I looked this up in my nursing drug handbook to be sure. A friend of mine used it during her cancer treatment, and did not keep it in the fridge. It does not recommend refrigeration, it just says to store in a cool place. It did not state the temperature requirement. Perhaps that has changed since it first came out. Take care, Annette""Xanax is a schedule 4 drug not a schedule 2 drug. I am not sure why your drug plan is asking for pre-authorizations for certain drugs, why not just ask them? My drug plan does not cover any benzos, including xanax. I don<APO>t think they are very good drugs and won<APO>t take them anyway. Perhaps your company changed plans starting in January and that is why they are asking for the pre-authorizations now. Often one drug coverage company will have a number of different plans, if your employer chose a different plan within the same company, then the rules may have changed. Take care, Annette""Try calling the SS office near you that handled your case. I called them a couple of times every week and asked when my check would come. I told the guy that it was an emergency in my case as I would get evicted if I didn<APO>t pay my rent. The SS worker told me they had a special program that would get me an advance on my back pay quickly. I told him I needed that, and he filled out forms over the phone for me. I ended up getting my entire back pay check fairly quickly, and my monthly checks started then also. That was over ten years ago, so I don<APO>t know if it still works that way. I would still call them a couple of times a week, my mom said ""it is the squeaky wheel that gets the oil"". Maybe they will just get tired of hearing from you. Congratulations!!!! Take care, Annette""Thank you for your service, and also for your suggestions. I hope to see you again. Take care, Annette""I agree with Swank that perhaps a different imaging test would give you more information. Even if you can<APO>t find the cause of the pain, you can still treat the pain symptomatically with medications to make you more comfortable. Thank you for your service. Take care, Annette""Do lots of research before you decide to have any surgery at all. I think only about 50% of patients have any pain relief at all. Those odds aren<APO>t good enough for me. I had a cervical discectomy when I started losing physical function, I was unable to use my hands properly and gripping things became problematic for me. My neurosurgeon said he would never do spinal surgery for pain, only for function. He didn<APO>t like those odds either. Arthritis Today magazine had an excellent article on back surgery last March or April. Go and find it and read it. It said that surgical and non surgical patients are at about the same place a couple of years post surgery. I am willing to go through the time and effort to heal, rather than have a dangerous surgery for pain relief alone. That is a personal choice. Take care, Annette""Because my surgery was on my cervical spine, I hesitate to offer much advice about the lumbar spine other than do your research and get multiple opinions before deciding to do it. I am just so hesitant about getting into surgery for other than functional deficits. I think adding hardware to my spine would be really hard for me to go ahead with. You have more experience than I about that. When I had my neck done, I did not even have a fusion done. The neuro-surgeon just removed the disc and let the two vertebrae fuse naturally. It took about five months, and he warned me that my neck would be slightly unstable for the first six months or so. A simple x-ray confirmed the fusion. He also told me the recovery would be far faster than if I had any kind of surgical fusion done. I was back to work after 6 weeks, full time in the ER as an RN. No restrictions except lifting above my shoulder level, which I rarely needed to do anyway. Six months later, I was rear-ended at a stop sign and the vertebra above the surgical site herniated. We decided to leave it alone and it healed fairly well after a year or so. I only fly down to see my son and his family once a year, it is an hour and 3/4 flight time. Not easy, but doable. I will have a few weeks of recovery time and then will be back to normal, whatever that is, lol. I flew to Florida once to see a friend, but I know I will never do that kind of long trip again. It took about 7 1/2 hours total from door to door. Have a great New Year. Take care, Annette""For strengthening exercises, I don<APO>t think you need more than a couple of visits to PT, tell them you want things you can do yourself at home. I did that years ago, and had no problem with them teaching me stuff. I strongly recommend a book called ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"" by Dr. Margaret Cahill, MD, PhD. Take care, Annette""Talk to your doctor, this is very common with antidepressant medications. There are a great variety to try, perhaps your doctor or pharmacist can recommend a different one. Another option is to try using cognitive behavioral therapy to treat your depression, you may be able to take less or even no medication for depression. Do not try this without consulting your doctor first. Meanwhile ask your doctor if he has any samples, it is not a good idea to just stop some drugs cold turkey. Take care, Annette""From what I have read it is the increase in serum serotonin levels that helps many people with pain control. Many of the antidepressants help increase the serotonin levels in your blood, so they should help with your pain. That said, antidepressants did not help my pain at all, so my doctor put me on gabapentin, an antiseizure med. I adjusted the dose over a few months, and found the best one for me. I also decided to only take it once a day about 4-5 hours before bedtime rather than in several doses a day. I wanted to avoid daytime sedation. This has worked for me. I don<APO>t know if it would be useful for you or not. It is something for you to discuss with your doctor. Take care, Annette""Not everyone has withdrawals from SSRIs including Cymbalta. My husband took this drug for a couple of years and tapered off of it in two weeks with no bad effects at all. He went from one pill per day to a half a pill a day for one week, then to half a pill every other day for one week. Then off. Follow your doctor<APO>s instructions, but don<APO>t expect the worst to happen, it often does not. Think positively about all health issues, it really does help. Take care, Annette""Matt, Just tell him matter of factly that they don<APO>t work well any longer and ask what he would suggest to get better relief. You may need to adjust the doses, or add a different med like neurontin, or a muscle relaxant. Be open to what ever he suggests, increasing the opiate may be one answer, but it usually is not the only answer. By doing what he suggests, you show him you are willing to try different things. I have used a generic MS Contin and generic hydrocodone for about ten years now, with the occasional adjustment in MS dose/schedule. I have adjusted it about once every 3-4 years. In addition I use neurontin, and tramadol. I also add in baclofen when things get bad, then go back off of it when things get better. I use Lidoderm patches when I believe they will help. I use my hot tub every day. Stretching, and exercise also help. By using a variety of treatment techniques and getting a small amount of relief from each of them, I get significant relief when you add them all up. Take care, Annette""I would consider you fortunate if the ultram works for you. I would just use that and put off the surgery until no oral meds will help, including the regular opiates. I use ultram along with my opiates and find it very useful. I would avoid spinal surgery for pain, it is only about 50% successful in providing pain relief, and the studies include 50% pain relief as being successful. So if you have half the amount of pain you have now, you would be in the lucky 50% that got ""relief"". Another recent study showed that after two years, the people who had surgery and the people who did not opt for surgery were at about the same place as far as pain was concerned. It also showed there was no danger in putting off surgery as far as permanent nerve damage goes. I have had one spinal surgery for a herniated disc in my neck. I had it because I was losing the use of my hands, not because of pain. My neurosurgeon feels that the risks of surgery does not balance out the possible benefits of pain relief, he will only do it for restoration of function. Six months later the disc above it herniated, I opted to leave that one alone. I do not regret that decision. It has been16 years now. Good luck, I hope you find an answer to your problems. Take care, Annette""Nothing to offend your doctor, but I have also heard of many patients who had normal lab work for their gall bladder, and the surgeon convinced them to have it out anyway, because he was ""sure"" that it was the problem. But once it was removed, they continued to have the same pain. The surgeon then told them that he had done all he could and referred them back to their pcp. It was not the problem, and they went through the cost, danger, and discomfort of having the surgery for nothing. ALL surgery involves risks from both the surgery and the anesthesia, it is easy for a doctor doing the surgery to say it is routine and safe, he is handling the scalpel, not under it. It would be difficult to convince me to have surgery of any kind based on the hunch of the surgeon and not held up by any real evidence at all from tests done. I had cholecystitis (inflammation of the gall bladder) when I was in my early 20s (I am now 59), my doctor told me I needed to have my gallbladder out after doing the only test available at that time that did not show any stones, based only on his feeling that my pain would not resolve without the surgery. There were less specific tests available then than now. I opted to ignore the doctor. My symptoms went away in a matter of weeks, and I have never had another problem with my gall bladder in all these years. maybe most people would continue to have problems, but we are all individuals, and I was willing to wait a bit and see if I were one of the people that would have repeated problems. Just gather all the info you can from tests, then have at least two surgical consults done so you have two opinions about that from unrelated surgeons in different practices. THEN make up your own mind, based on all the tests, the two surgeons, your pcp and any other doctors you see, and your own feelings about the pain you have and any other symptoms you have. Usually your gut opinion will tell you what to do, and it is usually right. Take care, Annette""Show the doctor just where you feel movement when you cough or sneeze, in fact you can cough for him during the exam to replicate the movement for him to feel. I doubt that would show up in a xray, and it may not show up in a CT or MRI when you lay quietly either. Discuss this possibility with your doctor. Take care, Annette""I would consider anywhere down as far as the lower edge of your ribs below your breast to be your chest. What you describe, I would consider to be your chest. Chest pain is not just right in the front of your upper chest. You can even have posterior chest pain which would be in your back over the rib area. Costochondritis can certainly cause pain under ones breast, it is an inflammation of the tissue surrounding the ribs. Take care, Annette""Some pain management doctors are interventionists, they want to do procedures and injections, they really don<APO>t use oral medications very often. I would ask the PM doctor<APO>s office staff before I even made my appt. what kinds of treatments the doctor uses. I prefer a doctor who uses all kinds of treatments, including oral meds. I feel that if I get a small amount of relief from each of several treatments, I may get substantial relief when they are all added up. Take care, Annette""I am very happy with her. I recently changed to methadone from a long acting morphine due to changes in my insurance. The methadone is dirt cheap compared to most of the other long acting opioid medication. I am very happy with it, I have better pain control than I have had in years, and my activity levels have gone up considerably because of that. I would add it to the list of pain meds that Charles gave you, I would also add that generics of the long acting meds are what I used before switching to methadone and I never had any problems with any of them either. Anyone who thinks of going to methadone does need a doctor who is very familiar with it to do the initial dosing and any increases that become necessary. It does not act the same as other long acting opioids, and must be used strictly as prescribed by an experienced doctor. I have been on opioids for chronic pain for about 20 years now and have never had a pain management doctor do the prescribing. I have had a couple of pain management consults over the years, and both said my PCP was doing fine with my treatment. I do recommend one at least have a consult with a PM doctor, just like one would have with a specialist for any chronic condition. Your PCP can get his opinion, then you and he/she can decide what to do. Take care, Annette""I am not Charles, but I am sure he will respond soon. Are you using breakthrough meds? Do they help you towards the end of your 48 hours to get you through until your patch can be changed? You might consider keeping a pain journal, if you don<APO>t already. I found that it really helps to pin down exactly when your pain increases, and if it happens consistently. Take care, Annette""By the way, if you did fracture that one small bone in the wrist (the scaphoid bone) that takes a long time to heal, the xray usually does not show it is fractured until about 7 days after the injury. So, even if it were xrayed the day after the injury, the xray is usually repeated in a week to make sure of the diagnosis. Usually the wrist is immobilized in a splint or cast. Take care, Annette""All good points. I would add that the orthopedic surgeon is not trained in pain management. So when he referred Jack to a PM doc he wasn<APO>t trying to get out of dealing with the problem, he just doesn<APO>t know how to do it. Take care, Annette""I totally agree with you. I always make an appt. with a new doctor for the first appt. of the day, even if it means waiting awhile to get it. This is to avoid me having to wait a couple of hours to see the doctor. I made such an appt. with a dermatologist, I specifically asked for the first appt. of the day and explained why. I told them I had severe chronic pain and could not sit around for two hours in a straight backed chair. The day of the appt. I got there 20 min. early so I could have my copay out of the way, and turn in my new patient packet. I waited 45 minutes after my appt. time of 8:30 am. I realize that some patients in derm. offices are just there for injections from the nurses, etc. However, the doctor being nearly an hour late for the first appt. of the day is unacceptable. I went up to the desk and asked for my copay to be returned as I would not be seeing the doctor. It took the lady a bit to do that paperwork as she had never done it before. I asked her if this was normal for the office or if the doctor had been in some sort of traffic accident on the way to the office. She looked at the floor and replied that it was normal operating procedure. I got my money back, went home and wrote a letter to that doctor, my doctor who had referred me to him, and my insurance company explaining that my time was important to me, as was my physical condition. I never heard from any of them, and I never went back. I feel as soon as more patients refuse to be treated that way, we will be treated better. I went to a PM specialist for a consult recently and he came into the waiting room, ON TIME, to escort me to the exam room. He behaved professionally, and I wrote him a letter after the visit, telling him so, and that I would pass on good things about him to others. You are right, doctors are usually to blame, seldom receptionists. It is a business, and the doctors are at the top of the food chain in their own offices. Hugs, Annette""I thought you were pretty sure you had tendonitis? If you now think you broke a small bone in your wrist, then an xray IS all you need, not an MRI. If that is the problem, then there is one small bone in the wrist that has a poor blood supply and may take a long time to heal no matter what you do about it. You told the doctor on Dec. 11 that you didn<APO>t injure your wrist, the fact that you remembered later that you might have and mentioned it to him on the phone doesn<APO>t change the fact that at the time he did not have that information. Charles is not an MD by the way. Take care, Annette""I have had these tests twice and was not sedated either time. The test took an hour or so to complete, and I drove myself home. Once it was very painful, the other time it didn<APO>t hurt a bit. Don<APO>t know why. You need to ask the doctor your questions prior to scheduling a test like this. Take care, Annette""Only a doctor can prescribe these drugs, getting them off the street can be dangerous. I think the person who commented about trying heroin was just trying to tell us they were at the end of their rope and needed help. Take care, Annette""Neither can anyone who doesn<APO>t have diabetes, cancer, asthma, etc. No one can fully understand how anyone else feels about anything. We all have our own perception of pain and any other symptoms we have. Each individual must decide for themselves who to tell about their medical conditions and how much to tell. I am fairly private about my medical info. Only my family knows what I have and few of them even know what my meds are. I prefer not to be known as that ""woman with FMS"". Take care, Annette""Many people learn this in a lab or clinic setting that has the equipment, and then do it at home without a machine of any kind used at home. For insurance coverage you usually need a RX for the initial training for biofeedback. You also may need a RX to tell the tech at the clinic exactly what the doctor wants them to teach you, like with PT or OT. Take care, Annette""Only a doctor who sees you in person and does a full examination and medical history can make a diagnosis for you. Tests may be needed to help him figure out what is wrong with you. Take care, Annette""You should never cut your fentanyl patches in pieces. Use them exactly as prescribed and tell your doctor if your pain is not being relieved. Take care, Annette""Years ago, I was taking several meds that affected serotonin, prozac which I took daily, a migraine med that I took several times a week, and one other daily one, whose name eludes me. My doctor went over the serotonin syndrome symptoms with me, and asked me to stop all three of these meds immediately if I had any problems at all and to call him right away. The way he explained it, if one developed symptoms of this rare disorder, stopping the offending drugs would allow the syndrome to go away more quickly than anything else. I used the three meds for about six months without any problem. I stopped using them for other reasons. Good luck with the meds and recovering from your depression. Take care, Annette""I would discuss this with the manufacturer of the patches you use. There should be an 800 number you can call. Ask for consumer assistance, and see what they say. You can also ask them if the have any free or doscount programs that you might be eligible for. Take care, Annette""Sorry, Charles. Logic does not go that way for my thinking. Nausea and vomiting are not signs of an allergy. Hives, and shortness of breath are the symptoms of an allergic reaction to a drug. However, I do agree that using the Mylan brand patches as ""medically necessary"" may fix the problem. Take care, Annette""Vicodin, Lortab, Norco, etc., all the hydrocodone/APAP formulas come with various amounts of acetaminophen (tylenol) in them, anywhere from 325 mg. to 750 mg. So do many of the oxycodone products. If one only takes a couple of pills a day, they probably are in no danger at all. But, I agree that if one is taking this kind of BT med long term that taking one with the 325 mg. of acetaminophen is better for ones liver than taking a higher dose. Just my opinion. Acetaminophen is one of the most common meds that people in the US overdose on. Taking too much on a regular basis, or too much on a one time basis, can do terrible damage to ones liver. Many people take other medications that also have acetaminophen in them, and it is too easy to go over the recommended daily amount if one does not carefully read labels to see what is in multi-drug medicines. As time goes on, it seems like the recommended daily amounts of acetaminophen goes lower and lower. It had been at 4,000 mg. per day, and I attended a pain management class last year and the instructor said that more recent research is leading many doctors to reducing even that amount. Of course, one should never mix alcohol with acetaminophen. Take care, Annette""Time to go see your doctor. It does not seem to be healing on its own. Take care, Annette""You must remember that even if the pot is legal in the state where you live for medical purposes, it is still illegal according to the federal laws. Because of this, if the doctor requires urine tests and you come up positive for marijuana, you are positive for an illegal drug. I suspect that the doctors who are willing to recommend marijuana do not do urine tests at all. That is a matter of each doctor<APO>s preference, not all doctors opt to do urine testing. Take care, Annette""Like Charles, I have been on opiates for many, many years. Schedule 2 opiates for over ten years. They have allowed me to continue functioning in my day to day life. Marijuana does not help my pain, it just gets me high, lol. I tried it years ago for my pain and since it did not help I declined to continue using it. At that time, my doctors all said whatever I used in moderation and not compulsively was okay. One of my concerns about using pot is that you really have little control over the quality where I live, unless of course you grow your own. At least with pharmaceuticals there is quality control and a specific dose provided. Don<APO>t worry about what class the drugs are in, just use them as prescribed and carefully. Deal with the side effects, if any, that you actually get, not what people say you will get. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Hydrocodone and morphine are very close in strength. Hydrocodone, the opiate in Vicodin, is not available in a long acting form, so using morphine makes sense as it is available in a long acting pill. I took generic long acting morphine twice a day with good relief for about ten years. When I first started with it, I only used it at night so I could sleep for eight hours. later, I switched to 24/7 use. Often changing opiates occasionally can ward off tolerance to some extent. All opiates cause dry mouth in some people, and that is what can cause tooth decay. As long as you brush and floss, and see your dentist regularly you should be able to keep your teeth in good order. Take care, Annette""Morphine is not the last option. There are a number of opioids that are stronger than morphine. Let the doctor decide what to try, give it an honest try, then tell the doctor how it is working. Adjust things from there. Change is always scary, be prepared for changes in your pain levels and write them down so you can be more accurate with the doctor when you explain things to him. I have seen no studies that show any one opioid is better than another. I really believe good relief is in the dosing, not the specific drug used. Take care, Annette""I would just tell the doctor what you said here and let him know what is going on with you with your present meds. Go from there. By the way, Roxicet IS oxycodone in a short acting form. Oxycontin is also oxycodone, but in a long acting form. Take care, Annette""Let your pain management doc know that the new meds aren<APO>t any better than the old ones. It may be time to go to a long acting med on a set schedule so you get 24/7 coverage for your pain. Why are you taking xanax? Xanax is for anxiety not depression. All the benzos are downers, so if you are already depressed, taking xanax may not be too helpful. I strongly recommend using cognitive behavioral therapy for depression. It has been shown in medical research studies to be as useful as antidepressants in treating depression. I had an episode of severe depression when I could no longer work due to my chronic pain conditions. I tried antidepressants which only made me worse. When I stopped taking them, my therapist suggested a book called, ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns, MD. I moved away at that time, and used the book on my own rather than finding a new therapist. I read the book clear through, then picked out the techniques that I thought would help me. It totally cured my depression. The depression has never returned. I had some anxiety problems while my son was serving in Afghanistan and Iraq, a total of three deployments. I used the techniques from the book again and it also worked well for the anxiety. I never took any meds for that either. I had bad experiences with benzos years ago, so I won<APO>t take them anymore. I guess what I am saying is that drugs are not always the answer. They are often the easiest way to deal with things, but sometimes it is worth it to put in the time and effort to fix the root cause of depression, anxiety, and other mood disorders. Take care, Annette""If the pain is the problem it might be better to treat the pain with a better pain med or a better dose of your present pain med. I knew when I needed to go on a set schedule with the long acting pain meds because I would dream I was in horrible pain, only to wake up and discover I WAS in horrible pain. Once I got the pain under control, I started waking up in a better state of mind. I keep my meds next to my bed with a bottle of water so I can take them first thing in the morning if necessary. Long acting pain meds are things like MS Contin, Oxycontin, methadone, Duragesic patches, etc. You use them on a set schedule, the pills are usually 2-3 times a day, the patches every 2-3 days, so your pain does not get out of control, like you describe in your mornings. Most doctors also give people like us a short acting opiate like vicodin to take if our pain is likely to spike up during the day. They last 4-6 hours for most people. If we get extra pain with extra activities, or if we are just having a BAD day. These drugs are taken as needed according to the doctor<APO>s instructions, usually only 2-4 times a day. I suggested seeing a therapist for depression and any anxiety you might have, because they can teach you to use cognitive behavioral therapy techniques so you don<APO>t get depressed or anxious. I use these techniques without any drug treatment. It cured my depression completely. One sees a therapist instead of taking antidepressant drugs if possible. Some people do both, I didn<APO>t. Ask your doctor if it might help you to take extra vitamins and minerals to round out your nutritional intake. Sometimes a shortage of certain minerals can help trigger leg cramps. Take care, Annette""I am surprised the office gave your husband the patches they did to help you withdraw from the fentanyl without you being there. They probably did not give him any vicodin because of the idea of you taking whatever you could get your hands on, they may have been afraid of you misusing it to get pain relief. Most doctors are well within their rights to dismiss someone who has cancelled two appts. and are taking schedule 2 opiates. Do you have a contract with this doctor stating what is expected of both of you? Perhaps seeing a psychiatrist would be helpful. Maybe they could refer you to a pain management specialist in addition to helping you get your anxiety/panic attacks under control. Take care, Annette""Doctors are not required by law to find you another doctor to see in any of the three states I have lived in. Some states encourage the doctor to give you the names of several other doctors who might be willing to see you. But you have to call them and make your own appts. and you and the new doctor have to agree that you can work together. Take care, Annette""I would suggest you stop worrying about what is causing the pain and concentrate of treating the pain instead. It is almost impossible to know for sure if pain is being triggered by a spinal problem or not. They have done studies of people who have had MRIs of the spine. Many of them complain of terrible pain and have normal MRIs, many have horrible MRIs with all kinds of problems documented on the films, and have no pain at all. I have had one cervical spine surgery when my hands started losing their grips. I was also a nurse, working 12 hour shifts in the ER. Since then I have additional disc herniation above the surgical site. This is very common. I also have FMS. Even though my cervical spine is a mess, I doubt that it is the cause of my pain. Wrong area hurts. You stated you had an MRI of your spine, what further testing would you like to have? What treatment would you prefer to try? I believe you are in pain, I also don<APO>t think it matters much what is causing the pain, you deserve treatment for that pain. Take care, Annette""Your comments about the difference between acute and chronic pain and how we should deal with them with stretching and exercise are right on. Welcome to the community. I am glad to hear you have found a PM doctor who is compassionate and listens to you. Take care, Annette""My town in Oregon also has free clinics, but they do not advertise because they cannot afford to. I am a disabled RN, and I was looking for volunteer work to do, it was hard for me to find them, but I did. Later, I discovered that this community has a 211 phone number for all kinds of helpful services like medical and dental help, in addition to housing, etc. My county also has primary care clinics for free through the county health department. I have never lived anywhere that had that before. You usually end up on a waiting list to get into one, but once you get in, as long as you keep your appts. you have a primary care doctor. I have found similar free or low cost medical clinics for folks in other states by using my Google search engine, I just type in ""free/low cost medical clinic in (town)"" and they come up. They often have different eligibility requirements, but it is a place to start. Take care, Annette""Please check your doses, etc. before finalizing your post. No one gives 100 cc. of any medication IM, 5 cc. is the absolute maximum given in an IM injection, it is much more usual to give a max of about 3 cc. per injection. The more fluid the more painful the injection is. cc. are a fluid measurement like ounces, etc. 60 cc. to one ounce. A cc. and a ml. are the same, but different from a milligram or a microgram. Milligrams and micrograms are weights not fluid amounts. Fentanyl is measured in micrograms. The fentanyl patches are measured in micrograms per hour absorption rate. Patches are commonly changed every 48 to 72 hours. Take care, Annette""Thanks so much for the correction, you are right of course. I typed out one really long reply and of course, it disappeared. So I rewrote it and copied it so I wouldn<APO>t lose it again, that one went right through. I was still really annoyed, when I wrote the above post. Thanks again for the correction. Take care, Annette""All opiates/opioids are narcotics but not all narcotics are opiates/opioids. Narcotics are by medical definition drugs that induce stupor. Your friends from NA are correct in including many other drugs in the narcotic category. The ones you mention fit in the narcotic category. You seem to have less than accurate information about these drugs. One can develop tolerance to Subutex according to my drug reference book, and its half life is 2.2-3 hours, not the 48 hours you mentioned. Fentanyl patches should ONLY be given to chronic users of opiate/opioid meds, per their own package inserts. My reference mentions morphine and oxycodone, including the dose per day, etc. but does not mention Subutex. When one switches from one pain med to another, one should start out at about 50% of the daily equianalgesic dose because there is only a partial cross tolerance to the different meds. Taking a full equianalgesic dose could overdose a person. The good conversion tools include a conversion factor that the doctor can fill in to determine a good starting dose for a patient. For this reason I would agree with your doctor to start you out at a lower dose patch, and see where you go with your pain. Using BT meds and gradually increasing the dose as necessary makes better sense than starting out at a higher dose. This is proper medical practice. Your analogy about using 200 mg. of oral morphine when you ruptured your gall bladder makes no sense at all. Acute and chronic pain are different beasts anyway. I don<APO>t know of any doctor who would prescribe 200 mg. of oral morphine for acute abdominal pain prior to arriving at the ER. Oral meds would not be used. Paramedics would start an IV and give IV morphine for pain as prescribed. I also do not understand about the dose of percocet you currently take. You say that 40 mg. is what you need to kill pain. Is that what your doctor prescribes? That would be four pills as the maximum amount of oxycodone in percocet is 10 mg. That would add up to a lot of acetaminophen daily as they only last about 4 hours. How does your doctor prescribe those? It sounds like your current doctor is long on compassion but is not really up on the hows and whys of prescribing these kinds of drugs, or of explaining to you how they work. MS Contin is more easily abused than fentanyl patches, that may be why he was hesitant to give them to you when you asked about them. I understand from your older posts and your more recent ones that you have had a problem with drug abuse/alcoholism. I would suggest that you find a pain management clinic that has both pain management specialists and addiction specialists so you can have both your problems addressed by experts. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""I do not think one should just dismiss trying the TENS unit to begin with. This unit seems to have no permanent ill effects, so it cannot hurt to try it. For many people it is one of the various things one can use to manage their pain. I was given a unit by a friend. I did not even have professional help or instruction in how to use it. Just the instruction book and what my friend told me. It still helped me. I would imagine that if I had professional assistance in how to use it, it might work even better. It does not get rid of all of my pain, but neither does anything else. For me it is one of the tools I use to get some relief. I still believe that if I use several of these tools that each give me a small amount of relief, then when I add it all up I get significant relief. That is a good thing. I believe it is crazy to just completely oppose something that helps many people and DOES NOT CAUSE HARM. Even if it were just the placebo effect, and I don<APO>t believe it is, why not just go for it? Give it a try? Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t believe that the more expensive drug is always the better drug. I switched to methadone as my long acting drug from a generic long acting morphine (it is far cheaper), when I went on Medicare this year, because that will keep me out of the donut hole altogether. Why do you take up to 10 oxycodone pills per day for breakthrough pain? There is no reason why you can<APO>t use oxycodone as a BT med with any of the long acting opiates. You may find it cheaper to take fewer pills per day, by increasing your long acting med dose, and taking fewer BT meds. Discuss this all with your pharmacy plan to start with. I did that, and then just went to my doctor and explained what I wanted to do, based on my insurance costs. She was more than willing to give it a try for me. It has worked out very well, I get better relief and take fewer pills per day. I was also able to stop taking three other medications that I used for pain flares. I have found that few doctors are really aware of the costs of drugs and different medical insurance plans. Take care, Annette""In addition to morphine, there is methadone and levorphanol. I agree with Rick, you might try a higher dose of long acting morphine. I really believe that any opiate will work for most people if it is dosed properly. I have not found any studies that show that any one opiate works better or has fewer side effects than any other. Take care, Annette""Shingles is pretty straightforward to diagnose. The skin lesions look just like Chickenpox blisters. They are not always present, that is the only thing that can complicate making a diagnosis. As they follow the dermatomes around the body, their location, or the location of the pain is usually a big part of making a diagnosis. They do not cross the mid-line at the front of the body. Usually if they are diagnosed promptly an antiviral is given, along with gabapentin or lyrica, and a pain med. If it has been some time that Shingles have been present before a diagnosis is made, an anti-viral may not be given as they are only effective if given early in the course of the illness. I have read that Lidoderm patches may be useful for controlling pain, but only on intact skin, not over blisters or open areas of skin. The blisters must be kept covered until they scab over as they are contagious until then. I had a patient once who was having his daughter scratch his back for him where the blisters were causing itching, not a good idea. Good and frequent handwashing also helps prevent the spread of this disease to others. Shingles is not transmitted through the air through respiratory droplets like Chickenpox is. Take care, Annette""I have seen Shingles on the torso, the head, neck, hand and leg during my nursing career. Most people do not require hospitalization for Shingles, you were unlucky in that respect, Trudy. Glad you recovered and recognized it quickly the second time you got it. Take care, Annette""I have had a couple of patients who were diagnosed with Shingles without having a rash. Due to the way their symptoms presented, I agree with the doctors who saw them and made that diagnosis. Different doctors had different patients. Find a chart of the dermatomes, available on line, and see if your pain follows the dermatomes. These are nerve roots that leave your spine and go around your body to the front. They do not cross over the front midline of the body, this is why any pain that crosses over is usually not due to Shingles. The Chickenpox virus goes dormant along the dermatomes, and if it pops up again, it causes pain and usually blisters along the dermatome where it had been dormant. If your pain matches up with the dermatomes, then take a copy with you to your doctor and discuss the possibility of Shingles. I have not personally seen anyone with pain in the areas you mention that ended up having Shingles. That does not mean it isn<APO>t possible, just that I have not seen it in my career. Are you seeing a neurologist? Take care, Annette""Darvocet is acetaminophen with propoxyphene (the active ingredient in Darvon). Some medical studies on using it for pain showed it worked about as well as plain acetaminophen for most people. That said, I have two women friends in their 50s, who both have used it with good relief for migraines and post op pain for many years. One of them is a RN, she has told me that it works better than vicodin for her. She was surprised at this, but says it has held true over time. The problem is not what med you were using, but that when you told the doctor it was not working for you, she simply gave you less of the same drug. And that after you saw a psychiatrist who supported you in changing the med for something stronger. Is she trying to taper you off of the drug? That is the only scenario that made any sense to me. Obviously, she is not comfortable prescribing pain meds. I would simply ask her in an open and honest way to refer you to someone who is more comfortable managing chronic pain than she is. If she seems to just insist that you are a drug abuser and that is why she does not want to give you anything stronger, find a new doctor. Take care, Annette""Try asking the new doctor<APO>s office if they have a cancellation list you can sign up on. That way if someone cancels their appt. you can simply take their spot. Many doctors keep such a list. My husband was moved from an appt. in two and a half months, to three days from asking to be put on their cancellation list. Best of luck. Take care, Annette""She switched you to a long acting morphine formula, Kadian with hydrocodone 7.5 for breakthrough pain. If she prescribed the Kadian (morphine) to be taken twice a day, after only three days on your present dosage, why are you depending solely on the Norco (hydrocodone/APAP)? It really does not sound like you gave the Kadian a real chance to work. You say oxycodone makes you feel a little different, but she has not given you oxycodone according to this post. Kadian is morphine. You do not say how it makes you feel different, so it is hard to say if that would go away with time or not. Many side effects of opiates do go away with time, constipation is the main side effect that does not go away. I would expect a period of adjustment when changing any meds, including opiates. I would expect more pain during the transition, but it should gradually become more bearable not less. Discuss with your doctor what to expect during the changeover from one opiate to another. Your use of IV opiates during hospitalizations in the past would not affect your ability to use oral opiates effectively now. You do not develop a tolerance that way. If you had been on IV opiates for quite awhile and up until the present time, that could cause tolerance. There are a number of long acting opiates you can try, but I would suggest you give them a longer time to decide if they will work out for you than you did the Kadian. Using opiates long term will usually cause constipation requiring laxatives. Because you have bowel problems already, it would be wise to be aware and take appropriate precautions for any bowel problems before they start. Discuss the use of opiates with your GI doctor as he is the expert about their effects on your bowel. Take care, Annette""Opiates are totally different from benzos. I am talking about opiates only in this post. The whole deal with opiate tolerance is that it is not dependent on past use when talking about the distant past, only when talking about the immediate past, up to and including the present. I personally think benzos should seldom be used on an outpatient basis. Just my opinion. Using IV benzos while on a ventilator has nothing to do with using benzos orally for anxiety. Take care, Annette""If the methadone worked great, but you feel you have built up a tolerance and it is no longer working as well, why not just increase the dose of the methadone? You generally have a choice of whether to change meds or increase the dose of the present med. I stayed on a long acting morphine for over ten years, and just increased the dose every few years. I recently switched to methadone for financial reasons. Both worked well for me. If I were you I would just bring it up when you are ready to make a change. Discussing what you might do in the future can<APO>t take into consideration what might be going on then, because you don<APO>t know what might be going on then. Take care, Annette""Just based on what you said here, it sounds like the doctor is doing the medically appropriate thing. Be sure to call her next week and let her know how the steroids worked. If they haven<APO>t helped, then more tests would seem to be indicated. If this is a doctor that you like and respect, then I would stick with her, if not you have to decide what to do as far as finding another doctor. Take care, Annette""You should not take any medicine long term without being advised by your doctor to do so. He will also tell you what dose to take, how often, and what to look out for as far as side effects. You can probably use any over the counter med according to the instructions on the box/bottle for a limited amount of time if you have no chronic health problems. Check with your doctor or pharmacist. I think most of them say for no longer than three weeks, but follow the instructions on the container.""Make an appt. and go see your doctor about this problem. Since it was listed as a rare side effect of the med you are taking, you might call the office and ask when you can see him and if you should continue taking the med meanwhile. Take care, Annette""Do you have any pain below the waist? Is it all in your arms? How long have you had pain? Do you have any other symptoms besides pain? Numbness, tingling, etc.? How do you know the meds caused the increased pain? Did the pain get better when you stopped the meds, or did it get worse when you started them? I would only expect the capsaicin cream to increase pain in some people. Did none of the meds you tried make any positive difference in your pain, or did they just not completely get rid of it? Has the doctor explained the 0-10 pain scores to you? What would your score be now? What would the best it has been since it started be? What would be the worst score since it began? What non-drug therapies have you used? To what avail? Take care, Annette""All I said was that you should move on and find someone else to manage your care. She cannot speak for herself, so we only hear one side. That is the nature of message boards, only patients are allowed to speak out. Doctors must abide by their confidentiality rules and do not give anyone their side of things in a public forum like this. She fired you, and you obviously hate her. I don<APO>t see how you and she could have a productive relationship feeling the way you do. I can<APO>t believe that you continued this relationship for five years with her being that abusive. That was your choice. Not all pain can be cured with medicine. Take care, Annette""It seems to me like she has fired you, and you do not like her either. We here on the board will never know exactly what happened as we only hear your side of things. If anyone ever said to me I ""was evil"" and she ""needed to pray"" for me, I would never see that patient again either. That would indicate to me that our relationship was not theraputic and unlikely to be fixable. I am sorry if that sounds terrible, but that kind of a relationship probably is not going to help you get any better. If she were your shrink, it might be different, but she is not. You said you told her that in response to her telling you that you should get welfare or SSDI, because you will not recover enough to go back to work. If you cannot figure out how to carry a medical file, and your purse and keys from an exam room to the front desk, you probably are not able to work. If she has been seeing you for five years, and you are at that level of recovery, I can understand why she may feel you are where you will always be functionally. Perhaps it was just a test to see how much you are actually able to do. I would suggest you let it go and just move on. If she fired you, she has made it clear she no longer wants to be your doctor, and you have made it clear you do not like her either. Let it go and move on in your life. What is an MMI by the way? I<APO>ve never seen that abbreviation. Take care, Annette""Knees are very tricky joints. Before having any surgery, I would get a second opinion and see what that doc says. If two orthopedic surgeons tell you different things, then see a third doctor. Doing nothing may be better than doing something that no two doctors agree on. By the way, what did these doctors tell you about playing your sports? Have they told you to hold off for now? Have they given you any PT to do to build up strength? Are you doing what they have told you to do? Did you wait to start playing again after your surgery in 12/08 as you were told at that time? Did they remove a plica? Did they find something else? Please do not just keep doing sports if they have recommended against it, and keep trying to find a doctor that agrees with you. You talk about playing in the present tense, not the past tense, makes me wonder. Taking good care of your knees now will make them last longer as you age. Take care, Annette""Reading an MRI is not like reading print on a page. The radiologists are usually very conservative and remark on any little thing they see on the MRI. The neurosurgeon has the comfort of already knowing you and what kind of pain you are describing. He can then match up any symptoms you are having with the MRI and see if he sees anything that surgery can help. There are ""normal"" age related changes of the spine that happen to all humans and do not necessarily cause pain or other symptoms. In some people they might cause pain, and in other people they don<APO>t cause any problems at all. There are also changes related to any surgery one has had. I would take the MRI film or disc to a second neurosurgeon and ask for a second opinion, see what he says. Take care, Annette""All he is saying is that you do not need surgery at this time in his opinion. I would think that is good news since the success of spinal surgery for pain relief is pretty poor. He is not saying you will be like this the rest of your life, no one can see that far into the future. If you had high blood pressure or diabetes you would be on meds for the rest of your life, I cannot tell if you will need meds for pain for the rest of your life or not, neither can the doctors. Next step is to go see the PM doc and see what he has to offer you. Take care, Annette""Just to be clear, I have used my pcp as my pain management doctor for all my adult life. I have had one time pain management consults with PM specialists 2-3 times, just to make sure we weren<APO>t missing anything. We weren<APO>t. Each time they have felt my pcp was doing great. I feel that your internist or family practice doctor may be as good as a PM specialist if they have the right training in managing chronic pain. If they don<APO>t, then go see a pain management specialist that fits with your philosophy regarding pain management. Take care, Annette""Did he say addiction or dependence? Maybe he doesn<APO>t understand the difference, some doctors don<APO>t. He is working with you for now. He gave you his opinion, and recommendation for your treatment. It sounds like he is giving you time to think about it and perhaps opt to see another doctor. That sure beats just stopping your RXs cold doesn<APO>t it? Most doctors know that even addicts can get meds elsewhere and recognize that addiction is a disease that requires treatment including detox from the meds. Opiates do not work for everyone, or for all kinds of pain. I hope your visit with the pain management doctor goes well for you. Take care, Annette""Surgeons are not trained in managing chronic pain, only the acute pain following surgery. I agree with your case manager, you should see a PM specialist. Be sure to see one that uses all kinds of treatments, not just injections and procedures. I would use cognitive behavioral therapy in addition to anything else they offer you. I have found it to be very useful. Then see where it takes you. Just try to do your best to use what is available to you. Take care, Annette""Cognitive behavioral therapy teaches you how to think positive thoughts and avoid the negative traps one can get into. This helps you get out of any depression or anxiety related problems and also helps you learn to manage chronic pain more effectively. I thought this sounded silly at first, but once I got into it, I was really impressed with the outcome. Over the years I have read more medical studies about it and how to use it effectively. Look for a therapist who sees a lot of chronic pain patients and ask specifically if they use it before making an appt. Take care, Annette""I would discuss it with your pcp. After that, I would ask for a referral to a neurologist to determine the cause of this pain. I have ruptured discs in my neck that caused a similar pain for me. That does not mean you have what I have. That is why you see your doctor and get a professional opinion. Many things can cause similar pain. Take care, Annette""My question would then be, what other studies are available that tested the value of non-narcotic meds for postop pain? Are there other studies that showed they were of value that this particular doctor had no part of? Take care, Annette""You need to go to your doctor and be evaluated. Good luck in your nursing studies. Take care, Annette""Great outcome. I am so glad you are doing so well. I had a cervical discectomy in 1992 and feel I have done well since. The disc above the surgical site herniated six months later, but I decided not to have further surgery and it too has healed well, with just time. Take care, Annette""I opted not to use the patches because I love my hot tub, at 104 degrees. It is the only thing that gets rid of 100% of my pain, at least while I am sitting in it, lol. As long as I know I can sit in my hot tub, which I do every day, I can deal with a certain amount of pain. I opt to use an oral pain med instead. Take care, Annette""The correct term is ""dependent"" on the patches, not addicted. Addiction is the compulsive use of a drug for other than what it was prescribed for, in spite of the negative consequences in your life. Addiction is using a pain med to get high instead of for physical pain, taking more than is prescribed, going to multiple doctors to get RXs, stealing, driving under the influence, etc. Dependence is when your body gets used to having a certain level of drugs in it, and if you allow the level to drop, you will experience withdrawal symptoms. Many drugs besides opiates cause dependence. I am 59, continue to enjoy life, I plan on doing so also. Take care, Annette""I am sorry to hear of your near death experience. But, I am even more glad to hear of your recovery. Fentanyl patches and Lidoderm patches are completely different from each other. The drugs are not even related. I also like my Lidoderm patches and have found them very useful for some kinds of pain, not so useful for other kinds. I also use a combination of oral opioids and occasionally use Lidoderm patches as needed for pain. Take care, Annette""I do have to have a hot tub, my doctor even wrote a RX for it. It is not a ""hot tub experience"", it is 100% pain relief as long as I sit in it. As long as I know I can go outside and sit in my hot tub if my pain is really bad, I can deal with the usually tolerable pain levels that I have with my oral meds. I sit in my hot tub just before bed every night, this relaxes my muscles enough so I can fall asleep with minimal meds. The few times I skipped this ritual bath, I did not sleep well at all. I have not skipped it for years now when I am at home. The few times I travel I take a hot bath/shower before bed, but it is not the same as soaking up to my neck. I discussed this with my doctor and she agreed with me that fentanyl was not the right med for me. I do not risk my health over it, there are other meds besides fentanyl for pain. Meds that you can use along with a hot tub if you so prefer. I do agree with you about tanning or sunbathing, due to the risk of skin cancer. Take care, Annette""It seems like doctors are always in a rush. I write down a list of my meds as I am currently taking them and hand that to my doctor as she sits down. Then I read to her off my list of concerns that I want to address at that appt. As we address each concern, I write down a note or two to remind me later what her response was. We stick to business this way and I usually get everything addressed. If I have a lot to deal with, I always tell the lady who makes the appts. that I may need extra time, so she can schedule me for a double appt. with extra time allotted. This keeps the doctor from getting behind and she is in less of a hurry. One can also make two different appts. at different times on different days, and address half the list of concerns at each appt. My last suggestion is DO NOT stand up, until you are finished. It is pretty hard for them to stand up and walk out while you are still seated and talking. Any doctor that rude, would be off my list anyway. I do my own research for the most part. I take it with me to show her, but only off of real medical sites, like Medline or Medscape. I do not bother her with off the wall stuff. I think because I only take her evidence based studies, she has been very respectful and willing to look at it for me. I have tried a few things that I found that way, with several doctors over the years. I think it is good for all of us to be well read on our own medical issues if we have the time to read about them. That keeps us up to date and informed about our own health, a good thing for everyone to be. Take care, Annette""I am with you, I would also stay away from the whole ""caine"" family. I am curious as to what your dentist does use now for numbing you up with the careful placement of injections. Do you know what it is? If you do not already, I would suggest you wear a Medic Alert bracelet stating your allergy to the ""caine"" family of drugs. These are commonly used anesthetics that are often used in trauma patients who cannot speak for themselves after an accident. In your case this could be life threatening. Having your throat close up is definitely a sign of an allergy. Take care, Annette""Stadol Nasal Spray is a short acting analgesic, for most people relief only lasts about four hours. My old pcp used it a lot for chronic pain patients when it first came out many years ago, but he stopped prescribing it. He felt it was too risky due to abuse he found in his own patients. He felt that too many people just did not consider a nasal spray as a potentially habit forming narcotic. He found a lot of his family practice patients with chronic pain, just kept spraying it whether it was time to use it or not, and regardless of his education efforts. He stopped prescribing it, that was in Nevada back in the 1990s. I tended to agree with him, still do. I do think rotating opioids every now and again is good for many patients. I like your steak and taters analogy. Take care, Annette""This drug, butorphanol, was made for moderate to severe pain, to supplement anesthesia, and management of labor pain, those are the listed uses in my drug handbooks. I think you may be thinking of another opiate agonist, buprenorphine. It is also known as Subutex, used orally to treat opioid dependence, injected for pain relief. I have heard of Subutex being used orally for chronic pain in some patients. It is also mixed with naloxone, and used orally as Suboxone to treat opioid dependence. Take care, Annette""I am glad you have not had any adverse effects form the fentanyl patch and laying out in the sun. That said, I don<APO>t think it is a good idea to assume that the doctor<APO>s instructions are to be taken so lightly. If the doctor said 20 minutes, that is what he meant, not an hour. I think it would also depend on the location where you live. Someone who lays out in the equatorial area in mid-summer would be under different temperatures than someone who laid out in my neck of the woods up here in the Pacific Northwest. Take care, Annette""I opted not to use fentanyl patches at all because my hot tub is the one thing that is sure to relieve my pain, I use it every day. I vote that you discuss this with your doctor or pharmacist. Please always use sunscreen when outdoors to avoid skin cancer. Tanning is really not a good idea, ever, not out in the sun and not with tanning beds. Use your time in the sun to do fun things instead. Take care, Annette""I really don<APO>t see how the name change will change the focus of this group. There have been times in the past when we did not have a resident ""expert"", although I will miss Indie and the info she provides I think we will all just get along like we always have. We used to have two groups for FMS, a Research &Treatment Board, and a Support Board. The research and treatment board focused on just that, and was dropped and we were told to go to the FMS Support Board. I really miss the old Research and Treatment Board. There is little discussion of research and treatment on the support board. It is much more a social group, with an occasional medical topic discussed. Most of the people who actually read about up and coming research no longer post there for whatever reason. I will still be here for now of course, but if it changes to a social chat group, I will start looking for other venues. I really wish WebMD would fix the things that they have that aren<APO>t working properly, like the email digests, and disappearing posts, before adding new stuff or changing other things. Take care, Annette""I agree with Teresa about most of her post. I would ask the PM docs what kinds of treatments they use before you make an appt. If they are interventionists, I would pass and look for a PM specialist who uses all kinds of treatments including oral pain meds, and PT, OT, psychological counseling, biofeedback, massage, etc. along with whatever injections they use. I believe that if you haven<APO>t gotten any good results with injections so far, it probably won<APO>t happen. I think it may be time to go on to other things. My internist manages my chronic pain. I had a one time consult recently with a PM specialist, and he said I was one of the best managed chronic pain patients he had ever seen. So internists can do a fine job. I have been her patient for 10+ years now. Orthopedic doctors are surgeons, they are trained to fix things with surgery, I don<APO>t think they are good doctors to manage chronic pain, but that may be just my opinion. Do your own research, then stand up for what you think is right for you, hear what they say and process it in the context of your own case, then decide what you think is best. Take care, Annette""Ask them for medical studies that prove what they say. If they can<APO>t provide any, then you have to decide if you want to have an unproven procedure or not. If they only do it in two places, I would doubt that this is an accepted and effective treatment. Take care, Annette""I have had migraines since I was about 35, and I am now 59. They are under better control now that I have gone through menopause. They do the MRIs, Cts, etc. just to make sure there is nothing wrong, like a tumor or something structural. Usually they do not show anything, they are done so the doctor does not miss anything. Migraines are often difficult to control. Opiates used to be the drug they ordered to get rid of them, because they had nothing else to order. Over the years, the doctors have figured out that opiates not only do not work well for migraines, but they actually cause rebound headaches that turn into chronic daily headaches. The body learns to expect the opiate, and when the serum levels drop down a few hours after the opiate is taken, the headache comes back. Unfortunately, usually they stop the opiates, and then the patient starts on the road to look for the meds that do work. I had to try many different drugs before I found the ones that work for me. Usually, you have to try any new med for 3-4 weeks minimum to find out if it works or not. After trying many drugs one at a time, the doctor then goes to ordering combinations of two drugs at a time. These are just the preventative drugs that you take on a daily basis. You have to do the same thing with rescue drugs that you take when you get a headache. The whole process can take a year or more. Some people find a drug that works for them, but after 6 months or a year it stops working, and you start again. I strongly recommend that your mom find one doctor that she likes working with and stick to him/her. It is important to find a doc that you feel good with, she may become a close ally in the fight against migraines. I ended up taking one preventative and I rotate three different rescue meds so that I never take any of them more than three days a week. That seems to be the consensus about rebound headaches, don<APO>t take any rescue med more than three days a week. None are opiates. I was having migraines about 5 days a week and visiting my ER frequently. I have not been to an ER or Urgent Care for over ten years now. I consider that a miracle. If she is indeed having rebound headaches, she may need to get off of all her pain meds to get rid of the headache. It can take 4-6 weeks for the headache to go away. Some people need to be in the hospital, but many people can do it at home. You are a wonderful daughter, but it is not your job to be her nurse also. It is great for you to help her out when she needs you, but you have to find a balance that works for you in your life. You may need to see a therapist who takes care of chronic pain patients and their families to help you figure this one out. Take care, Annette""I take methadone for FMS pain, I recently changed over from morphine, due to $$ and insurance. I am very happy with it. My doctor was in a group that preferred not to manage chronic pain, she left the group and is in solo practice now where she can do as she feels best. However, the answer to your question, is yes, they can cut you off of any medicine at any time. I do not know what your dose was, or how how much notice he gave you, so I don<APO>t know if he was ethically correct. If you have already gone through withdrawals, at least that part is over with. I am somewhat confused about that though, as you also state you are buying them from a friend of the family. It IS illegal to do that. If your doctor had two deaths from respiratory failure due to opiates, I would also be concerned about his education level on pain management and using the drugs appropriately. Take care, Annette""The opiate in percocet is stronger than the one in the med you are currently taking. He prescribed an appropriate starting dose. When you switch from one opiate to another, you will find that you only have a partial cross tolerance to the new opiate, for this reason if the doctor started you out on an equianalgesic dose, you could overdose. It is usual to start at a lower dose and adjust it as needed. Take care, Annette""Brugette1, I called a neurologist on Montana once, got his name from a journal article and Googled his phone number. He happened to answer the phone and spent nearly an hour on the phone with me. I was in NV. I had migraines and he had treated them and written an article about it. I was curious about some issues in the article. I never spoke to him again. He knew at the get go that he was not going to get $30,000 from me. Medicare is pretty much the forerunner for approval, once someone get Medicare approval, the other insurance companies dive in. I would not go for anything that Medicare has not approved, and has no double blind studies to support it as being effective and safe. It is great that the doctors claim such high success rates. I hope it all works out well for you. Take care, Annette""There is no way to know before surgery if it will help you or not. No guarantees of success. I would worry if a medical company contacted me and offered a discount. What is that about? Take care, Annette""If the only info available is on their website, I would decline. There is no ""natural opening"" into the spinal canal or to the discs. That is why they have to make an incision to place this instrument. It sounds like the same old minimally invasive disc surgery that they have been doing for awhile. I am not sure what makes this different. Any procedure that has only been done for 6-7 months is too new for me. How do they define success? Is that for lower pain levels, pain free, better functional levels? Are their patients off of all opiate meds, just lower doses of meds, how much lower? If they have done 4,000 patients in six months at two places, my math brings us to around three hundred plus patients per facility per month. That would be ten plus patients per day, seven days a week. I would ask them what their complication rate is? How many patients do not get a successful outcome? Ask for specific numbers, not words like ""many"" or ""most"". I wouldn<APO>t do this personally, but that is just my opinion. Take care, Annette""I do not think the size of the scar is that big a deal. I had an old fashioned discectomy using an anterior approach for my C5-6 disc back in the early 90s. My scar was only about 2 inches long and the doctor did it in the natural fold of my neck. It has been virtually invisible for many years. I have to stretch my neck out and point to it for anyone to notice. I showered the day after the surgery and would have been discharged the next day, except I had one of the possible complications of any surgery, I developed a blood clot. My surgeon did a sonogram at my request, and had already written discharge orders, kind of laughing at me insisting that I had a clot. Had I been at home, or less educated about these things, I probably would have not been diagnosed early on. My surgeon was well ahead of his associates in those days as he was the only one in our town who would do a discectomy without doing a fusion on carefully selected patients. Fortunately, I did do well except for the clot, which took some extra care to deal with. I was back to full time ER nursing in six weeks, without any restrictions other than not lifting above my shoulder level, an acceptable restriction for most nurses. A good friend of mine back on the East Coast went to an orthopedic surgeon complaining of back pain that her own pcp had attributed to FMS, and this guy convinced her to have a microdiscectomy the next day, she did, developed sciatica which she had never had before, he gave her one injection after not returning her calls until she mentioned a lawyer, then he told her he had done all he could and to go back to her pcp. He said the surgery was ""successful"" and did not cause her sciatica. It took her several months to get rid of the sciatica, and her same old back pain was still there. It is my friend<APO>s doctor that leads me to always say get independent medical studies that show a surgery is successful and be sure you know what they define as ""successful"", it may be different from what you think. She just wanted the pain to go away and was willing to listen to whatever a doctor told her. I would rather have a slightly longer recovery time with a slightly more invasive procedure until they can prove success with a minimally invasive procedure. The medical people are doing amazing things through scopes that they could not do when I started nursing, but I am not willing to be a guinea pig myself. Cheers to people who are, but they should know before they have the surgery that they are part of the whole experimental process that enables medicine to progress. Take care, Annette""I am leery of buying anything advertised so heavily on TV. One person DIED, and it made the newspaper here very recently, because his Teeter Inversion Table got stuck in the upside down position and your body is not meant to stay in that position for long. After you do your research, I would buy at the cheapest place that is willing to give you a warranty or guarantee that you feel is reasonable. ""Teeter"" is the brand name of a particular inversion system. Don<APO>t believe everything you read, find as many medical studies as possible, rather than anecdotal information. Take care, Annette""I have not had this procedure, please do all your research prior to signing any consent. Take care, Annette""The only doctors I have ever met who did not have DEA numbers were the doctors who work at the VA, who does not require them. All the other doctors I have worked with over the years had a DEA license. My PCPs have always managed my pain with opiates, that has gone on for well over ten years now. I believe in going to whatever doctor you feel the most comfortable with. Take care, Annette""The new doctor is not accurate in the info he is giving you. The opiates shouldn<APO>t kill you. Ask him just how they would do that? I would stick with the PM doc who is trained in managing pain and has been seeing you for six years. I have been on opiates for FMS pain for over ten years now and it works well for me. One PCP I started to see years ago, wanted me to detox the first time he saw me, I told him I had a specialist to manage my pain meds, and I didn<APO>t need him for that, just my regular day to day care. After a few visits, the new doctor agreed with my specialist and offered to manage my opiates for me so I would not have to see two doctors. I declined. He was a nice guy, just new at his job. We got along fine after that. Take care, Annette""Ask the pharmacist what o use to remove the residue. Perhaps a non-acetone nail polish remover, that gets rid of most adhesives, if that is something your skin can tolerate. Ask the pharmacist or the maker of the patches you use first though. Take care, Annette""Gimpy is correct some drug companies will reduce the cost or give out free drugs to keep a customer. Call the 800 number of the company that makes the drug, and ask for the customer assistance program. Another option with some insurance companies is to get a letter from the doctor stating this is the only drug that will work for her, a pre-authorization letter. Sometimes they will allow you to take a brand name drug for the generic price, if there is no generic. Insurance companies do not always tell you this is possible, other than in very fine print. There are other long acting opiates she could use to avoid the high price. There is generic long acting morphine, methadone, and levorphanol that come right into my brain, there may be others also. Explain to your doctor just what your insurance covers, and he will help her find the right med. I recently changed from a long acting generic morphine to methadone for my chronic pain. I did it to miss the donut hole in Medicare Part D. It is really cheap compared to other pain meds. The first week or two was a bit more painful for me, while I switched over, but after that things got good. I am doing better on the new med, and taking fewer other meds. Your insurance company should have a formulary, that they sent you when you first signed up, or at the beginning of the year. This is their drug list that tells you what they cover and at what rate. Take it with her to the doctor, then he can see just what her options are. Take care, Annette""I am so sorry that you are having so much pain. You are not on a particularly high dose of MS Contin. However, that said, Greg is on a very high dose compared to most people. He is lucky to have a doctor willing to go that high. When I switched over to methadone, I was taking 60 mg. twice a day of generic long acting morphine. I switched for financial reasons due to my insurance changes. I am happy with the change. I am actually doing better. Theoretically, there is no limit to the amount of opiates one can take as long as they increase the dose slowly so as to avoid respiratory complications. As long as one does not have intolerable side effects one can keep increasing the total dose per day. However, most doctors are not willing to just keep raising the dose forever for both medical and legal reasons. As for dealing with your doctor, I would give him functional goals that you would like to reach and just ask him what you can do to get there. Sometimes that gives the doctors a way to document the improvement in your health due to the meds or non-drug treatments they give you. That is what is important in their notes, documentation that the care you receive from them is actually helping you function better. I wish I could take on your pain for one day, just to give you a break. Hugs, Annette""I do find the methadone seems to work better for me right now. I am up and doing more than I was before, and that is good for me. Like Charles, I have worked with people in far worse straits than I, so I try to look on the bright side of things when I can. Taking on more pain for a day or a week or whatever is really not a big deal, nor is it something I would do lightly for just anyone. My cousin, who passed away last week from cancer, was hoping to get well enough for a bone marrow transplant at one point. I told him I would be happy to be tested to see if we were a match when the time came. He told me he would never ask me to do that, as it was very painful for the donor. I told him what I tell you, I know pain, I can deal with it with the meds my doctor gives me. It is just not that big a deal when it comes down to something important. Watch what you wish for. I worked with an ER doctor many years ago. He had chronic back pain after an injury, that he did not treat with opiates due to his work. He finally had surgery and he was lucky that it took care of his pain. Later he told me that if he could suck it up and go to work, he didn<APO>t see why more of our patients could not do the same. He was a great doc, very caring, and treated chronic pain patients we saw in the ER very well. Your son will get it eventually, it sounds like he is at the point of many newer docs, he thinks he knows everything. That passes, especially as they work with old, experienced nurses, lol. Just kidding. Hugs, Annette""If your pcp can<APO>t seem to help you, I would ask for a referral to a neurologist who manages headaches. There are some basic things to be done, then it is a matter of trying all the different kinds of meds until you find a combination that works for you. It can be frustrating and time consuming, but there really is not any other way to do it. Stick with one doctor if possible. As for the hurting in all your joints, I don<APO>t know if that is related to the headaches or not. Let the doctor know about this also, and do what he suggests to figure out what is the cause of this. Take care, Annette""Just be honest with your rheumy about your pain levels. Discuss them like you would any other symptom. Tell him what your functional levels are and what you would like to be able to do that you cannot do because of the pain. Be willing to try anything within reason (non-invasive stuff). He does need to document things to justify any increase in your opiates, but that is just paper work he would be doing anyway. Take care, Annette""It sucks having to look at going two more days in pain, but you have done it for the last 6 days, and you can do it for two more. Don<APO>t call and leave a message for the doctor to call you back or call in a RX for something, call and tell them what you have told us and that you require an emergency appt. to see the doctor face to face as your pain has been out of control for a whole week. The fact that the percocet made you vomit, is just a sign of an expected side effect of the percocet, nausea and vomiting. This usually goes away after a few days or weeks of use, and if needed you can take an anti-nausea med to get through that time. I don<APO>t know what your dose of tramadol is, I used it for years at 100 mg. for a breakthough med. 50 mg. did nothing for me at all. I know you cannot exceed 400 mg. per day. I do not recommend mixing xanax with fentanyl. I don<APO>t like benzos at all, I feel they are prone to abuse, have too many side effects and are potentially dangerous when mixed with opiates. That is not just my personal opinion, it is a growing medical opinion and was taught at the pain management class I took last year. I would do all the possible non-drug treatments for your pain that you would normally do. I do not think staying in bed is good for any kind of chronic pain, so get up and move around a bit anyway. Ask a loved one or someone close to you if you are doing everything you can. Because you are in so much pain, you may have forgotten something that actually works well for you. I was miserable once and had totally forgotten I had Lidoderm patches, my hubby reminded me and they got me through that flare. I depend on my hot tub, but because you use the fentanyl patch that is out, but you could use a heating pad on a painful area away from the patch. My best advice is do not deal with this over the phone, doctors tend to believe patients who take the time and effort to go to the office and be seen in person. They tend to be more dismissive of patients who just leave phone messages. That is just my experience and my personal opinion speaking. Take care, Annette""What else are you doing for pain management? There are a variety of meds and non-drug treatments for pain. Most people are not just on narcotics. Take care, Annette""I have gone to the FDA website and read the requirements of generic drugs, and no where could I find that they can swing 40% either way and still be approved. I have taken generic drugs all my life, I have always opted to use generics whenever possible. Ambien and Lidoderm patches were my only exceptions because they were not available generically, although the Ambien is now, and I use the generic of that. I have probably taken six or seven different generics of my pain meds, and never noticed any difference at all between the various generics and the name brand drugs. I have used Mallinkrodt made generics without any difficulty. I simply do not believe all the stuff I read on message boards about generics. I would be happy to read any randomized, double blind studies of brand name vs. generic drugs that truly show there is a difference. Please direct me to one if you know of any. It would be financially worthwhile for any company to prove that their drug works better than the others, so I believe if there were a difference, the company would pay for the study to prove it. I do think that anyone who wants to pay the extra money for brand name drugs should have that alternative, if they wish to pay out of their own pocket. But, I don<APO>t think I should have to pay more to an insurance company through premiums or co-pays because someone else wants brand name drugs while I use generics. I look forward to a single payer system without any insurance companies at all, but that is another whole discussion, lol. Take care, Annette""I still disagree with your doctor. I have read all the arguments on line about this generic and that generic not being as good as the brand name. I finally went to the FDA website and read their requirements for approving a generic drug. They not only have to have the same amount of the same drug, they have to work in the same time frame, and at the same level of relief. You are correct in that the fillers and binders can be different. But they are inactive ingredients. It is interesting that your doctor does not put stock in evidence based studies. I have volunteered on state committees to evaluate various drug groups for our medicaid program with doctors and pharmacists. We were given a class on how to tell if a study was of good quality or not. We then evaluated all the studies available in English, and decided if they were of poor, fair, or good quality, and assessed their findings accordingly. We then decided which drug would work the best, never mind the cost, that was not factored in at our level. I have never used Oxycontin, because when I needed a long acting med it was not available in generic form. With all their lawsuits about the patents, etc. I am glad I did not switch to it when a generic became available. I have a good friend who works in the adverse event dept. of a pharmaceutical company that makes generic drugs. She has found that it is usually opioid users that complain that their generics aren<APO>t as strong as their brand name drugs. The company keeps a sample of all lots of drugs, so they can go back and retest then if they get complaints. So far so good. I have read here on this board that a specific brand name drug works far better for one person, and another person will write in and say that they found a particular generic to be far better than that brand drug for their pain. The only way to truly find out is to a double blind study where NO one knows what kind of drug they are getting, or what maker made it. Then you go back and check the data after the study is over. Go online and read about the diversity of responses to generic ambien. I take whatever my pharmacy gives me, I have had three or four different generics, all the same to me. Take care, Annette""Teresa is correct. You can Google ""free clinic in (your city)"" and find some possibilities. I have done that for friends all over the US. If you go to the ER, as soon as you get a bill for it, make an appt. to speak to someone in the business office. They will know what indigent care possibilities there are for you. The hospital can discount the bill entirely, or drop the amount, and help you with payment plans. Do not pay this bill with a credit card. The hospital will ask you to do this because then they get paid the entire amount right away and do not have to worry about turning you over to collections later on. You will have to pay interest to the credit card company. Tell them you don<APO>t have credit cards and wish to apply for indigent care discounts or a payment plan. At the very least if you can work out a payment plan with the hospital, you can avoid interest payments. My hubby had his hip replaced and we worked out a payment plan for the maximum that we could directly with the hospital, we used his credit card only for the rest of our share of the bill, after our insurance paid. The yellow pages charge to advertise so you won<APO>t always find free clinics in the yellow pages. Also call Goodwill, Salvation Army, Catholic Charities, and your health department. They may know what is available in your community. Take care, Annette""Always do what you and your doctor have agreed to do. Don<APO>t ever change anything based on what you read on line. Write down any concerns you have, and take them with you to your pcp to discuss. Take care, Annette""Do not stop anything or add anything without discussing it with your pcp first. Going off of klonopin abruptly can cause withdrawals. Adding valium could be problematic also considering you are already on klonopin and fentanyl. It all depends on the dose and how often you take it. I personally think that mixing any opiate with a benzo is a bad idea. The instructor of the last chronic pain management class I went to for health care providers suggested that the latest research says these drugs should never be prescribed together, and she expects this to be the way things will go in the near future as this research is completed. I would never suggest you do anything counter to what your doctor has prescribed for you. Discuss this with him to make certain that you are only taking what he wants you to take. I also have only one doctor, my pcp, that prescribes my meds. This helps prevent interactions and overdoses. If I see a specialist, he or she writes a report and sends it to my pcp, then she and I sit down together and decide what meds, if any I should add to my treatment plan. This may seem cumbersome, but it is far safer in my opinion. Take care, Annette""Your doctor is doing the right thing, even if it is very inconvenient for you. Obviously, this person knew what meds you were taking if they told the doctor what you allegedly gave your son. I am with Swank on this one, I don<APO>t discuss my meds with others. And do keep them locked up, especially with a teenager in the house. His friends are coming and going, and you never know for sure what a teenager is up to. I know that from experience. Take care, Annette""Nausea and vomiting are expected side effects of all opioid meds, even the fentanyl patch can cause nausea, as it starts in the brain, not the stomach. You may be more sensitive to some of the opioids than others in this respect. If the patch has not helped you yet, you can either increase the dose or try something else. Tell the doc the truth about how you are feeling, he cannot be expected to read your mind. Did the oxycontin help you when you were pregnant? Did it cause vomiting? Is your doctor willing to try giving you an anti-nausea med for awhile until you get adjusted to the opiates? You said the patch has not helped you yet, and you have been on it for three weeks. How much opiates were you taking per day when you started on the fentanyl patch? Perhaps you have not yet achieved the correct dose for you, or maybe it is just not the right drug for you. Do go to the Cleveland Clinic for a consultation as soon as you can. Take care, Annette""If you are throwing up less, then perhaps that side effect is gradually going away. I am a nurse, so I am in no way dissing the nurse, but do not discuss your meds or needs for RXs with the nurse, discuss them with the doctor directly, face to face, not on the phone. He is the one writing your RXs, and he is accountable, not the nurse. You seem to have more pain on PT days and on days when your little one runs you ragged. Keep a journal of your pain and activities. Present it to your doctor in person and tell him that you want more good days when you can really go for it with your PT, and enjoy your son more. Ask him what to do to attain those goals. I have been taking Norco or a generic of it for about 15 years, my liver is checked regularly, and it is fine. There are BT meds available without tylenol in them if you wish to discuss it with your doctor. Best of luck. Take care, Annette""Tell this to your doctor. Only he is able to make an accurate diagnosis and recommend a treatment that may work. Once you get a diagnosis, someone here who has experience with that problem may offer suggestions that help them. Take care, Annette""I happen to agree with you about taking a little meds as possible. I would rather deal with some problems than deal with the side effects of the meds to get rid of them. Every three to six months I re-evaluate may meds and try going off of any that don<APO>t seem to work. At this point I am down to far fewer meds than I used to take. And, I feel much better. Make an appt. with your doctor, and take a friend or family member to it also for moral support and as a witness. Make the appt. just to talk about your meds, do not add that request on at the end of another appt. for something else. Be firm with your doctor that you wish to try and taper off of at least one drug at this time. Listen to what she has to say, and if you still wish to get off of a drug, say so. Let her know that if it does not work out, you will go back on the same drug or a different one for the same symptom if necessary. I would decide which drug to try and get off of, then taper it according to your doctor<APO>s instructions. Only do one drug at a time, so you know what is doing what to you. Keep in mind that you may actually need all the drugs you are on, don<APO>t set it in stone that you are going to get off of them all. Be flexible. I am an old nurse also. I had a bad bought with meningitis one year that affected me for a couple of years as far as making my migraines much worse. I also have fibromyalgia and DDD in my cervical spine. I am finally down to neurontin, pain meds, and ambien. I add baclofen and lidoderm patches as needed, but not too often. I have rescue migraine meds that I use prn also. I am very proud of myself for getting off of a lot of the other meds I was on. Some doctors seem to always add another med, rather than getting rid of the ones that aren<APO>t really doing any good anymore. My doctors have always been willing to help me get off of drugs I want to try to do without. I would rather deal with some symptoms without drugs than be on drugs for them. Keep in touch. Take care, Annette""Joy said she still has headaches and tremors and some chronic pain. These all make it clear to me why she would be still taking the meds she is on. I am also pretty clear why someone would want to occasionally try and see if they would do okay without a lot of meds. The only way to know is to try. She said pretty clearly that she feels better without the opiates. She may be taking the meds she is on for the symptoms she has left. Many of us will never be pain free, we aim for less pain. If she gets what she considers adequate pain relief from ultram and her other meds, good for her. She is not even on the maximum dose of ultram so she could increase it some if she needed to. The effexor she mentioned taking does work on seratonin and norepinephrine. It is good for chronic pain as well as migraines and depression. The clonazepam, and phenergan are often also used off label for migraines. I have taken all of these for that purpose. I have been on as many as three preventative migraine meds at a time as well as 2-3 rescue meds for migraines. I would far rather have my other chronic pain than I would my migraines. The meds she takes for muscle spasms may also relate to her headaches. Some doctors prescribe muscle relaxants in case the headaches are both migraine and tension headaches combined. She may also take it for her tremors. She wants to figure out what meds she might be able to do without, good for her!!! I would be on about a dozen meds if I never tried getting off of any. As long as she is open to ending up on some or all of her meds, it is still worth a try. Meds do have side effects, we should all aim to be on as few meds as possible for each of us. Using other techniques for all the symptoms we get is a good idea when possible. Use meds when you truly need them, but don<APO>t get locked into the idea that every symptom justifies taking a drug. I support anyone who wants to be on fewer drugs as long as they are comfortable with their symptoms. I also support anyone who needs to be on meds as necessary. But it should be up to them which way to go. Take care, Annette""I would ask your pcp for a referral to the nearest university teaching hospital. They often see the more difficult cases that cannot be managed by local doctors. I flew from Reno, NV, to SF to go to UCSF Medical Center for a neurology consult. I found it very reassuring and useful. Take care, Annette""Opana is a synthetic opioid, and morphine is a natural opiate. They both work by attaching themselves to opiate receptors in your brain and on your spinal cord. I took a generic of MS Contin for about ten years, and did very well on it. I changed it recently due to insurance changes. I am doing fine on the new drug I am on now. The strength of the particular drug is not important because the doctor will prescribe it according to how you respond to it. They are not all prescribed in the same way as far as mg. per dose. There are equianalgesic charts available but they are not really totally specific for individual people. They are tools to use for trends for most people. I personally believe that it does not make much difference for most people which drug they take as long as they get the right dose. But, there are some people who just respond better to one drug over another. You may just not be the right person for Opana, perhaps morphine will work better for you. Although I have read many studies, I have found none that really show that any one opioid is better than another, or has fewer side effects than another. If anyone out there has a link to any study like that, I would love to read it. Another thing is that most people with chronic pain also take other meds for the pain, perhaps an antidepressant, a muscle relaxant, or an anti-seizure med. These help lower the pain levels in their own way. Also, what non-drug treatment methods do you use? Take care, Annette""I wouldn<APO>t give it any more than two days, then call the doctor and let him know where you are with your pain. I switched from morphine to methadone recently after ten years on the morphine for insurance reasons. It took a couple of weeks to adjust the dose, my doctor told me I could call her on the phone for that. I usually see her in person for anything, I feel I get better care that way, she prefers it also. Give it a chance, it usually takes some adjusting to get the dose right on the new med. I had no withdrawal either, just had to adjust things to best control my pain. Let the doctor decide when and if to give up and go back to the Opana. He will at some point probably ask you if you want to raise the dose or go back to the old drug. Is he giving you a BT drug that is short acting to use during the switchover? I did and that made all the difference for me. My doctor gives me a BT drug anyway, she just told me to use it as needed during the changeover. Do not wait until Friday or the weekend to get in trouble and not be able to get a hold of your doctor. Have a plan by Thursday night if possible. Take care, Annette""Discuss this with your doctor. I take methadone now, which has to be the cheapest of all opioids, a month<APO>s worth at my dose is about $25. That is without insurance, paying cash. Whether you adjust your present dose, which is common after changing from one long acting med to another, or try a different drug entirely, or go back to the Opana, is up to you and your doctor. I continue to use BT meds for break through pain 1-3 times a day. Take care, Annette""Keep a piece of paper near your bed, and jot down what you are experiencing as it happens. Take a family member or close friend to your doctor appt. with you, tell them in advance what your goals are so they can help you explain what is going on to your doctor. Write down any changes in your treatment plan that the doctor suggests so you get it right when you leave to go home. I had a rheumy once who handed a print out of the treatment plan to every patient as they left. It was great for both him and the patient. No excuse for not remembering what he said to do. You know as a nurse, that when a patient says he just wants to sleep and can<APO>t get out of bed, that is a huge red flag for depression. pay attention to your body and what it is telling you. Relay that info to your doctors.. I do kind of understand how you feel, I have been in a similar place in the past. If CBT is not the answer for you, and you are reacting to your current antidepressants badly, then you need to find a different treatment plan, but that is up to you and your psychiatrist. Animals are great, they do keep us going when nothing else would, because we feel a responsibility to care for them. I have two rescue dogs that I got from shelters. I also walk the dogs at the local animal shelter once a week, it gets me out of the house, and is very helpful for the shelter and the dogs. I can do anything for a hour or so a week, even if I feel really awful. Sometimes I don<APO>t know how I will do it, but I do. If you ever come to the end of your rope, call 911, or get someone to take you to the ER. Do NOT hurt yourself, or give up. Hugs, Annette""I worked in hospitals were we were paid a night shift differential, a buck or two an hour extra for working nights or evening shifts. I have found over the years that working a late evening shift would be best for me, some thing that ended about 3 am, so I could still get to sleep during the dark hours. Early morning shifts are not for me. I worked the occasional 7AM to 7PM shift and did not like it at all. However, I am pretty sure working the graveyard shift for 15 years has contributed to my illness, FMS, at this time in my life. It was great for my son growing up, he hardly noticed I was working sometimes, because I worked while he was asleep, came home and got him off to school, slept, and got up out of bed when he came home from school. He had me at my best, most rested times, lol. I wouldn<APO>t go back and change it at this point in time, but the night shift definitely has its drawbacks for most people. If I needed to be up to do something during the day, I just did it. I often got by on just a few hours of sleep. It is just not healthy for most people in the log run. I also never worked entirely full time once my son was born. I only worked enough for us to survive on, because I wanted to be home with him as much as possible. I was divorced early on in his life and did not remarry until he was about 10. I always supported us financially. That decision has impacted me badly now, but I would not change that either. I never knew I was going to get ill and have to stop working at the age I did. I did love the adrenaline rush of working the ER and ICU, I enjoyed the autonomy too. I usually worked in small hospitals where I was the only nurse on duty in my unit at night. I miss it. Take care, Annette""Boy, six kids, how did you manage that? My mom had five kids, and my dad died at about 46 of lung cancer. Mom had not worked while she was having kids, she had worked as a civilian secretary at an Air Force Base prior to having kids. She went back to work when dad was diagnosed and studied and worked the rest of her life until she finally retired at 65. Died at 69 of cancer also. By the time she retired she was a GS 13, started back as a typist at the very bottom, and worked her way up. I am very proud of her. She told me after my dad died to never have any more kids than I could support by myself, because you never know what the future will bring. I would have loved to have a whole herd of kids, but that always stuck in my mind. So, I stopped at one. I was married for 4-5 years to my son<APO>s father, then I moved out and divorced him. No bitterness, he had his own problems and could not settle down to be a dad and a husband. My son and I were on our own for about ten years, then I remarried and we have been married for 20 years now. My son is grown up and is married and has two kids a teen and a three year old. They are great and I am so proud of him. He was a Marine, served in the invasion of Afghanistan, and the invasion of Iraq, then went back for an occupation tour in Iraq. He also visited Somalia, and Kosovo, but that was just briefly, then God. I did what I did for my family. I loved working and would never have stopped until I had no other choice. We all just do the best we can in life. You and I were fortunate enough to get to do work that we truly loved, that is a big deal. Take care, Annette""Sorry to hear you aren<APO>t doing so well lately. I am a RN too, and I just refuse to take a med to counteract the side effects of another med, unless the offender is some life-saving drug for cancer or something. I believe that for some reason my body would be telling me that it does not do well with that drug. I would taper off of the offender, and try something else. We are lucky these days to have many different drugs and drug families for various problems. Although Provigil is not an amphetamine, it<APO>s mechanism of action is unknown. I am of an age to remember when doctors prescribed amphetamines to nearly everyone. They were the great wonder drugs that would sharpen your mind, and put you a bit ahead of the next person. Then they figured out that you needed barbiturates or valium to come down and sleep at night. That was okay, they just prescribed that too. When I graduated from nursing school, valium was THE most widely prescribed drug in the world. We ended up with a bunch of drug addicts running around looking for a fix or a treatment facility so they could get well again. I refuse to even try provigil until a lot more is known about it. You have stopped taking it, and your pain levels are coming down to your base line. I would follow what my body is telling me. If you are getting all those side effects you mentioned and are pretty sure it is the cymbalta, I would discuss getting off of it with your rheumy. Taking provigil will not solve all those problems. I opt to have only my internist prescribe my meds, all specialists I see send her a report and then she and I sit down and discuss the findings and decide what to do med wise. When I was first diagnosed with FMS we tired all kinds of antidepressants, muscle relaxants, etc. I had terrible zombie like effects from them. Finally, my pcp and I decided to just treat my symptoms directly. I tapered off of all my meds, and only took an opiate for pain and zolpidem for sleep. This worked for many years. I added neurontin about 8 years ago. Lidoderm patches have been useful for me, as has baclofen, during flares. I used cognitive behavioral therapy for depression when the antidepressants did not work. CBT did work. My hubby had the worst pain ever when he had to take prednisone for awhile years ago. Horrible joint pain. I totally agree with you to only mess with one drug at a time. It takes longer, but then you know what is doing what. Just sit down and explain to the doctor exactly what you have said here. I understand what you are saying, he should too. Fixing things may not be easy, but you can do it. Take care, Annette""Nice to meet you. I am sorry though, but I think the drug company invented ""shift worker disorder"" just to sell more of this drug. I was a night nurse for years, and yes, we had a more difficult time with sleep, but I don<APO>t think it is a medical disorder that requires a stimulant RX, lol. It requires careful sleep practices or getting off the night shift. I think they ran out of narcolepsy patients and just wanted doctors to prescribe Provigil to more people. Perhaps I am being a bit cynical, lol. Take care, Annette""Since we don<APO>t know what all meds and what combinations of meds you tried, we would have no way of telling you what you might try. I would suggest you stick with one doctor, preferably a headache specialist. It can take several years of trying different meds and combinations of meds to find the right combo for you. Take care, Annette""Find one doctor and stick with him through all the different possible combinations of meds. Usually it takes 3-4 weeks on each preventative to see if they will work, then you go to combos of 2 or 3 drugs at a time. It can take several years and lots of patience. Take care, Annette""You can write a letter to your old doctor, and request a copy of the Xrays, or whatever he did imagingwise along with your medical records. The request will be forwarded to him or to wherever he stored your records. Doctors are required to store medical records for a certain length of time even if they give up their practice. Your parents should have insurance records that would include the name of the orthopedic doctor. It is likely your doctor spoke to him after he saw you and they decided you would benefit from seeing the ortho. You can also write him requesting all your old records from him. Take all the old records to the new ortho of your choice. You mention ""all my other pills"", what all are you on? There are many kinds of pill interactions, perhaps that has something to do with the reluctance of doctors to prescribe more opiates. An ortho should be able to do tests now that show how well your leg healed, often hamstring tears do heal after a long time, even if you don<APO>t stay off of it like the doctor told you to do. I am sorry, but I pretty much agree with swank. If you refused to do what the doctor told you to do so you could get well, you can<APO>t really expect other doctors to just write you opiate RXs for the rest of your life. See an ortho, have whatever diagnostic imaging he feels is necessary, stick with whatever treatment he recommends for as long as he recommends, and see what happens. If after doing everything he recommends you still end up with chronic pain, then you can ask him for a referral to a pain management doc for oral meds to help control the pain. There are other meds besides opiates that are good for pain, try them all. Good luck, Annette""I worked in the ER as an RN for many years, and I have seen many chronic pain patients and many drug abusers. It is very difficult to tell the difference when you have a skilled addict complaining of back pain. Back pain cannot be proven with any test, that is true of many kinds of chronic pain conditions. It will be great when someone invents a laboratory test that proves if someone really has chronic pain. Meanwhile, I would prefer that any ER doctor I know give meds to an occasional addict rather than refuse meds to someone who really needs them. Drug addiction is a SERIOUS disease, that requires specific treatments for the patient to get well. I would far rather have my chronic pain conditions that be addicted to opiates. Drug addiction is very difficult to treat successfully, few addicts get successfully into recovery. I have also worked in an opiate addiction treatment clinic back in the 1970s, so I have experience from both ends of this problem, as a nurse and as a patient. It is far more complicated than one would think. Take care, Annette""I have never heard that the length of time you have been on opiates, or the amount of opiates you take, changes the number of opiate receptors you have. Or that it would change how they work. There is a rare condition where some people seem to have increased pain after coming off of opiates that cannot be explained by their medical condition. Some practitioners say that the extra pain is due to the opiates themselves. Take care, Annette""If any person is using any opioid in any other way than the doctor prescribed it, it is abnormal. Doctors do not normally prescribe methadone to be taken IV at home. If this person has oral tablets and is crushing them and dissolving them to shoot up in their veins, they are drug abusers. If they are taking drugs not prescribed to them, they are drug abusers. If they have IV vials of methadone and it is prescribed to them, and they are using it according to the RX, then they are doing what their doctors said to do. If you have any concerns, call their doctor and explain to him what you have seen and let him deal with it. Call 911 if you have any concerns about the safety of the person you are talking about. Take care, Annette""There is no way to know how you will do on the patch. They work very well or many people. Follow your doctor<APO>s instructions and ask him about any problems you may have. Anytime you change from one drug to another for anything, there is a time where you may have to adjust the dose either upwards or downwards. It would be wise to begin the new drug at a time when you won<APO>t have to drive or work just in case it makes you a bit sedated. Let someone close to you know you are starting a new drug so they can be aware of any changes in you also. Usually the change over from one opiate to another goes pretty smoothly. Just stay in touch with your doctor for any problems. Take care, Annette""What I have read about BT meds is that many doctors prefer to increase your long acting med if you find you need to take the short acting med every 4 hours. If you require a breakthrough med consistently throughout the day, it is not really breakthrough pain. Breakthrough pain is occasional pain that you may get due to extra activity at some point during the day. Many articles I have read suggest using breakthrough meds no more than a couple of times a day. Some suggest not using it at all, but controlling the pain with the long acting med. Take care, Annette""Just discuss all this with your doctor. Let him decide with you what to try next. I use the generic of Norco for breakthrough pain, and I take 1 1/2 to 2 tablets at a time, 2 -3 times a day. I have used that for about ten years now. When I find my meds aren<APO>t working, I usually increase my long acting drug, then the BT med starts working again. I have never found any studies that show any opiate is better than another or has less side effects than another. I think you just have to keep trying different doses or different drugs until you find the combo that works for you. Take care, Annette""This older antidepressant is often prescribed to help patients sleep. The newer SSRIs often do not make a patient sleepy at all. I looked Trazedone up to make sure I remembered right, it is not listed in my drug book as a tricyclic, but as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor/antagonist. My doctor told me many years ago when I tried it that it was different from the tricyclics, which mediate serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine. Made me a total zombie, I did not take it for very long. Other people react differently to it than I did. I always start out with the older, cheaper, generic drugs, then if I get side effects that don<APO>t go away, I try one of the other drugs. If you don<APO>t happen to be one of the people who gets side effects from a particular drug, you can save tons of money over the years. I have rarely really needed the newer non-generic drugs. I don<APO>t take any now. Take care, Annette""Why would I dwell on that? Who knows, I certainly don<APO>t care. Let<APO>s think about more positive things in our lives instead. Take care, Annette""Many blood draws must be done after fasting for 8-12 hours. So, check with your doctor before drinking a lot of fluids prior to a blood draw. Hydrating well certainly helps the nurse or tech find a vein. Take care, Annette""Have your current pcp refer you to a pain management clinic that uses a multi-modality system of treatments, not just an interventionist who does injections and procedures. You need a clinic that includes a psychiatrist for psychological treatment of the pain and PTSD. Many types of back pain have no proof of the cause of the pain, a PM specialist should be able to treat the symptoms not look for a cause. Take care, Annette""Go see your doctor. Find out what is going on, so you can fix it. There is an occipital neuralgia that can happen if the occipital nerve gets irritated. That sounds near where you are saying your pain comes, but it is impossible to diagnose anyone on line. Even doctors need to examine you. Take care, Annette""I switched over to methadone at my own request. My insurance changed, and the methadone is far cheaper than any of the others. I was taking a generic long acting morphine for about ten years with fairly good results. I took about two - three weeks to switch over, and had no particular problems doing so. I worked as a nurse at a methadone treatment facility for opiate addicts many years ago, so I had no fear about using this drug long term. I have been able to stop using two other non-opiate drugs, and have not had any real flares since starting it in November. It was originally made to replace morphine for pain during WWII by the Germans, when they couldn<APO>t get enough morphine. When I was in nursing school in the late 1960s we used it for pain management in the terminally ill. Around that same time in the US, it was also used for heroin addiction treatment. Now it is used for both pain and addiction, it is by far the cheapest opioid available. I do believe that you need an experienced practitioner to help you with prescribing this drug. Take it exactly as prescribed, and NEVER take any extra doses, keep it locked up with a lock and key. Tell your mom that all the opioids have about the same side effect profile. If you go to a high dose of methadone, you may have a baseline EKG done and then the doctor should decide how often to re-check it. Few people have a prolonged Q-T interval, but that is a rare side effect. Keep seeing your dentist for proper checkups, and brush and floss regularly. All opioids can cause dry mouth and that can lead to tooth decay. Constipation is the main side effect, but that can usually be managed with a proper bowel care program, discuss this with your doctor if it becomes a problem. If you ever have hair loss, discuss this with your doctor, it is a common side effect of thyroid problems. I expected it to work for me, and it has. I went to visit my son and his family about a month after switching over, and found myself able to help them around the house without the pain I was used to having. I find myself more functional on this med than on the morphine I was on before. Switching from one opioid to another seems to decrease pain levels. This is due to a partial cross tolerance that seems to develop with opioids. You can switch over at a lower dose than one would expect and get the same amount of pain control or better. Hope it works as well for you as it has for me. Take care, Annette""I am so glad things are going well for you during this change over. Increasing your prednisone can also increase your energy levels. What are you taking the prednisone for? I cannot remember what your pain is from exactly. Do they know at this point? How long have you been on the prednisone? It is a wonder drug as far as making you feel better, but you can get some pretty bad side effects if you have to take it long term. Usually they try and get you off as early as possible depending on what your diagnosis is. I took trazedone many years ago to help me sleep and to improve migraines. It made me into a zombie, so I stopped taking it and went to something else. Other people take it without any problems at all. I suggest you always tell a close friend or family member when you start a new drug, that way they can tell you if you seem different or odd. Often we do not see it in ourselves. Take care, Annette""This is a major surgery, do not make this decision based on fear of being in pain forever. There is no guarantee that you will get pain relief. I think Charles quotes about 50% of patients get significant relief, that is also what I have read. I have also read that the lower in the spine you have the surgery, the less successful it may be. Many articles say that about half of the patients who have spinal surgery get about a 50% reduction in pain. I personally feel that I would have to have a loss of function before I would have spinal surgery. I would not do it for pain alone. I had a one level cervical discectomy back in 1992 for functional deficit. Discuss with your surgeon what he considers a successful surgery, ask him what kind of pain relief you should expect, and what his complication rate is. Especially what the rate of infection is for him in the hospital you are planning to go to. I would get at least one opinion from a neurosurgeon who works on spines for most of his practice. Preferably one who has done a fellowship in spinal surgery. Then discuss it with your pcp, and see what he thinks about your general health as far as having surgery. Ask him what he sees in his practice of patients like you who opt for the surgery. The surgeons discharge patients after the surgery is complete, the pcp keeps on seeing them and knows how things work out long term. If after your research, you feel it is worth the risk to have the surgery, go for it. There is always a risk/benefit ratio that you have to figure out for yourself. Take care, Annette""I have no excuses for the rudeness of the nurse. However, I do believe it is reasonable for doctors to want to get to know their patients somewhat before prescribing opiates. I have personally found that every doctor I ever went to said they don<APO>t prescribe opiates for chronic pain, especially at the first visit. However, once they got to know me and my pain conditions, they all did offer me opiates. It never took more than three visits. All most all opiates and non-opiate pain meds can cause nausea, this side effect often goes away over time, it can also be treated with anti-nausea meds if necessary. Ultracet contains less tramadol than the meds that have tramadol alone in them. It may be that the lower dose will be well tolerated by your husband. If it is not, then you make an appt. and he goes in to see the doctor and explains to him what is going on. Your husband then does whatever the doctor suggests, and you continue like that until he finds something that works for him. After awhile the doctor will be impressed by your husband<APO>s willingness to keep looking for a treatment that works, and he will probably offer him an opiate. Drug seekers will not keep trying, they give up after one or two appts. and go elsewhere. People with chronic pain keep coming back. I would not do anything by phone with the doctor unless she personally tells me to. I make appts. and go see the doctor. This gets me better care as she is focused on me and my medical records sitting in her lap. She also sees that I consider this important enough to come in and see her. Any one can make a phone call and complain, it takes commitment to make and appt. and come in and keep it. Drug seekers don<APO>t usually do that kind of follow through. Often nurses and office staff just tell people on the phone what the doctor has told them to say. If you are told something in a rude or unprofessional way, let the doctor know the next time you go in to see him. Unfortunately, it is not easy to tell the drug addicts from the chronic pain patients until you get to know them a bit. Don<APO>t worry about what other people do or don<APO>t get, just focus on your husband and what he needs. The squeaky wheel gets the oil, be polite, but be persistent. Take care, Annette""Sorry, but there is no way to look at someone and tell that their pain is real or not. Everyone deals with pain in their own way. My husband had AVN of his hip and was basically walking around on a broken hip. He was seeing the doctor for something else, and I kept telling the doctor that there was something wrong because every time he turned over in bed, he yelled out in pain. He examined him and my husband barely winced. He finally did an xray and told us he shouldn<APO>t even be able to stand on it. He put him on strong pain meds until he could finally have the surgery to replace his hip. He walked on it like that for 2 years with a cane, but rarely complained. Someone else might come in crying and sobbing for a minor sprain, their pain is real to them. The only way to tell accurately what a person<APO>s pain level is, is to explain the pain scale, and ask him where his pain falls on the sale, and then believe him. Then you work together to get the patient down to an acceptable level of pain. I really believe that this is best done by sticking with one doctor and letting him get to know you. My husband<APO>s doctor now knows that he will be stoic and minimize pain, that is his character. Use all the available methods for pain management, not just opiates. I hope everyone here finds a compassionate doctor and works with him/her, that is your best bet. Switching from doctor to doctor usually makes things worse, not better. Take care, Annette""I live in Oregon and get great treatment here. Take care, Annette""I am so glad your rheumy made some positive changes in your meds. I know you will feel better. I would not worry about taking a break from opiates until you feel it is really the time to do it, then discuss it with him, not now. I have heard of opiates causing increased pain in certain patients. However, I have also heard it is very rare. It also shouldn<APO>t be that hard to diagnose. It would seem to me that the opiates would never give one relief for any length of time if they were causing increased pain. I have gone several years at a time without increasing my opiate dose, so that diagnosis does not seem to fit me. Why do you assume you will go down hill in 2 1/2 years? By then they may have found some wonderful new thing that will cure us all. Take care, Annette""A trip to Mexico sounds great. It is a good thing that you don<APO>t have time to worry too much about what to take. Just grab the warm weather clothes and go and enjoy. Be sure ALL your meds are in their labeled RX bottles, not a pill box in your purse, lol. Take care, Annette""In addition to what Teresa says, I would suggest you write out a list of the goals you have of things you would like to be able to physically accomplish that your pain currently keeps you from doing. Present this to the doctor rather than telling him you are still in pain and want more drugs. Ask him how he can help you to attain these goals. Start small and work your way up to the larger goals. This way he can document in your medical chart exactly what you are trying to do, and what you try, and how it works to help you be more functional. Doctors like to aim towards being more functional. Take care, Annette""Ditto what Teresa said. You did not mention how long you have been clean and sober? I have had addicts tell me they were an ex-addict because they hadn<APO>t used in 12 hours. Get yourself hooked up with NA and go to meetings regularly if you are not already. They do not require payment so not having insurance won<APO>t matter to them. You may not get to take opiates until you are well into your recovery period, like many years clean and sober, or ever. That depends on the doctor. PM doctors all have different modes of practice. You should check them out before you go to see if they are of the same philosophy as you are. Take care, Annette""I just checked out your other posts and you said you completed your second methadone detox 5 days ago. Does your treatment facility know you are using Norco and how much you are currently taking and who is prescribing them to you? If they are aware of your Norco use, and you are getting the Norco from a doctor who IS aware of your addiction and your recent methadone treatment, I would be surprised. You should be going to more than one NA meeting per week since you are not working and newly detoxed. I would think one meeting a day would be more appropriate. Good luck with your recovery, please take it very seriously as addiction is much more difficult to treat than chronic pain. Take care Annette""Thanks, if you have the time and the notes handy, I would appreciate it. I am always into learning new stuff and keeping up to date. Take care, Annette""I do not consider you clean and sober if you are still lying to your doctors, even by omission. If you are not telling your doctors about your addiction, you are doing yourself a disservice. In order to help you they need to know your entire medical history including the addiction. You should be seeing a PM doc and an addiction specialist. If you finished detox six days ago, and have NOT used anything without a legal RX and you are telling all the doctors about your history, then you are six days clean. That means you are telling your addiction treatment people about the Norco you are taking, and the PM people about the methadone detox. You said on one of your posts that you attend NA once a week, that is not enough for someone as newly clean as you are. You also said you are not currently working, so go to a meeting every day. Consider that your job for now. I have read your posts on the addiction board also. Please be sure to treat your addiction as a serious health problem. It does not matter how you became an addict. You describe yourself as an addict, and the facts that you bought all kinds of opiates off the street, and do not tell all your doctors the truth about your history leads me to believe you. Using opiates as prescribed for chronic pain still carries a 5% risk of addiction. People need to always be aware of this fact. No one wants to end up an addict, any more than anyone wants to end up a diabetic. But, it can happen and if it does, you need to treat it seriously. Take care, Annette""Everyone is different, but in my experience ultram 100 mg, worked about as well as one vicodin for my pain. I have used it in the past. It may not work as well for someone else. Please understand that it does not matter to me how you became addicted. It can certainly happen to people who use opiates for chronic pain. But once the use of the opiates becomes compulsive and goes out of control, you need treatment for the addiction in addition to treatment for the pain. I have had sciatica and hip pain and there are other treatments besides NSAIDs and opiates. I know because I used them. Tell your doctor about your addiction to pain meds and let him decide how best to proceed. If you don<APO>t tell them the entire truth, you will suffer for it in the end. Take care, Annette""It is still possible to become an addict if you are a chronic pain patient. The stats I have read say there is about a 5% rate of addiction in folks who use opiates for chronic pain. Although this is a small % and everyone thinks they will not be the one who develops addiction, it is still possible. This is something we should all be aware of and careful to watch for in ourselves. Take care, Annette""I worked in a methadone treatment center for opiate addicts years ago and we used gas chromatography for ALL our urine tests. I think addiction treatment clinics use different tests than PM doctors do. I am not up to date on what addiction treatment clinics use these days. Are you saying what PM docs use for testing, or what addiction treatment clinics use? Take care, Annette""I agree with Greg. The wording the doctor<APO>s office uses is very important when it comes to getting payment from an insurance company. It needs to be worded so that it comes across to them as medically necessary, not as trolling for addicts. Take care, Annette"."This has happened to me at two pharmacies. Both times I called the head pharmacist and told him that I was shorted, but I was not expecting to get the pills fixed, just that he should know that they were short. I am an RN and am familiar with drug diversion and addiction. Both times it was vicodin which I get a month<APO>s supply of at a time for BT meds. They count pills by fives when they count them out, it was never five or ten or fifteen missing, it was always an odd number. I did demand a count in front of me at the pharmacy from then on. I found both times that there was a shake up in the personnel and procedures at the pharmacy. Some personnel disappeared and never came back. I honestly do not know if it had anything to do with me complaining. Schedule II pills were locked up after being put in the RX bottles, but the schedule III pills were just left out with the other RX bottles for pick up by customers. I think that is when the pills were snagged. The pharmacies I used both times, changed their policy so that all scheduled drugs were locked up immediately after filling the RX bottles. This means I have to wait until the pharmacist with the key can open the safe and get my meds out, but I am willing to do that. I no longer need a pill count in front of me, I do count them when I get home, to make certain the count is correct. So far, so good. I recommend that if anyone is missing drugs, to speak up calmly and quietly, and tell the pharmacist in charge. Take care, Annette""Opioids are remarkably well tolerated in most people for the long term. I have read recently some concern about some doses of methadone and EKG changes in certain age groups. You might ask your doctor if you fall into an age group where an EKG might be useful just to make certain you are not one of the very rare people who can be affected by methadone this way. Take care, Annette""This is a discussion you should be having with your doctor. If you are concerned about the dose or how long you have taken it, talk to him and tell him. Take care, Annette""Check with your insurance company to see if they have a pre-authorization form for your doctor to fill out for you to get non-formulary meds. If they do not then go ahead and try the Morphine ER if your PM doc will write you for it. There is no interaction or problems that I am aware of with using it orally in conjunction with your pain pump. You may have to adjust the oral dosage for the first few weeks to get the dose right. Does your insurance also cover methadone? This is a really cheap long acting opioid. If your doctor has experience prescribing this med, it may also work for you. Just talk the whole thing over with the PM doc who writes your RXs. What he says about tapering you off of the IT morphine over six weeks, then leaving the pump in place for three months sounds reasonable. If you still feel you don<APO>t want it, then you can take it out. It is surgery after all,be sure it is what you want before you have it removed. Take care, Annette""I agree with you about not wanting a middle man with one more level of communication to screw up your message. However, I don<APO>t recommend using the phone to communicate with your doctor unless he has told you specifically that you may call him and bypass the nurse. By coming in for an appt to tell him what is going on, you let him know just how serious YOU feel your problem is. (and he gets paid for the interaction. Very few doctors get paid for phone calls or emails, our insurance system just hasn<APO>t yet caught up with computer technology.) It is normal to need more frequent doctor visits during the first few months after surgery. I hope you feel better soon. Take care, Annette""I understand that the email digests will be stopped, at least for awhile, according to WebMD the last time I spoke with them. Do you know if and when they will be back? All the ""new features"" that Web MD has promised sound fine, but the email digests are the one thing in the last ten years that were actually an improvement over what we had before. Even with all the problems we have had with them, getting them once a day, beats not having them at all. Take care, Annette""Thank you so much for going to the trouble of looking this up. I will check with the lab and see if that is what they are currently using. My doc just started doing random urine tests this year, 2010. They billed mine to the wrong insurance company, it cost $317 and change. I called them and they are going to re-bill it to my present insurance. I sure hope they pay, lol. I don<APO>t mind paying my share, 20%, but even that is about $60. The doctor got one from each of her pain patients to start out, I don<APO>t know how often she will require one. I guess we will see. Thanks again. Take care, Annette""I was the EMS liason person at one ER where I was the nursing manager. It was a small rural hospital. Fun, you know what I mean, lol. My doctor<APO>s asst. called me back this am, and told me they billed the correct insurance company for the drug screen. She said they plan on doing the random screens about twice a year. I have been seeing the same doctor for about 12 years, and never, ever asked for early refills, lost drugs, etc. She always tells me if all her pain patients were like me, life would be so much easier. I am an old RN and just know what doctors need to know about, and how to play the game. I just try to offer up whatever I know about what a poster is asking about and try to avoid being judgmental. That is all we can do. I am doing okay. My cousin and his sister<APO>s husband both died within three weeks of each other. I don<APO>t know how she manages, I would be a mess if I lost both my husband and one of my brothers in such a short time. We knew my cousin was going to die, he had been ill for quite awhile, but her husband died all of a sudden after being well and healthy for most of his life. Makes me realize how important it is for all of us to keep in touch with relatives and not put off until next year what we can do today. I got held up while working in the ER once, a guy told me he had a gun and wanted the liquid cocaine in the eye cabinet. I talked him down and pushed the panic button that called the local police. I had him undressed, in a gown, and laying on a guerney, behind a curtain, by the time they arrived, guns drawn. They arrested him, but he had a hand laceration that our doctor needed to suture up first. My buddy had evacuated the ER of the rest of the patients while I had him behind a curtain. Great team work. The hospital had an incident debriefing meeting on the one day that month when I was working the night before and the night after the meeting, both 12 hour shifts. They would not give me any time off so I didn<APO>t go. I needed sleep more than that meeting. My nurse manager told me she was sorry but that was the time they had worked out that they could do it, lol. Typical hospital corporation. You have been through much more of that kind of thing than I have, due to your line of work. Thanks again for the name of the test, I looked it up and did some reading about it. Take care, Annette""I am so sorry to hear about your mom and dad. It is hard all the way around, no nice way to lose parents. Death brings out the worst in family relationships too. You find out who wants the money and stuff pretty quickly. When I worked in one small ER the night nurse (me) had to do the coding for the whole day<APO>s (24 hours) patients. I went through the charts and added up everything, assigned codes for supplies, time the doctors spent with the patients, etc. It was time consuming. It did go faster once I memorized codes for stuff. I always ask for itemized bills when I use hospitals. Errors never seem to be in the patient<APO>s favor either, lol. I check to see what I was billed for, I always ended up getting billed for stuff I never used, lol. I would correct the bills and return them to the hospital. They always sent me a new corrected bill. They asked me once why I cared since it was billed to the insurance company not me. I said ""So, it is okay to charge them extra?"" They didn<APO>t say anything. Computerized charting has to be better all around. My husband<APO>s doctor<APO>s office uses it. I never worked anywhere that had it before I retired, and the place I volunteered for 9 years after I retired had all hand written paper charts. It was a free clinic so no worries about billing. That part was great. Most hospitals charge for opening a crash cart too. Usually each drawer is sealed so they only have the drawer replaced through the pharmacy or central supply, or the nurse does it. It is great having you here to chat with. It is nice to be able to share memories with another adrenaline junkie. Take care, Annette""You might ask for a referral to a wound clinic. They really helped my hubby with a wound that he had that simply would not heal. The infectious disease doc sent him to a vascular surgeon too. They all did their bit, and he finally healed up. I read your other post, the ER will rarely do an MRI. They just figure out what needs to be done immediately and do that, then they refer you to a followup doc for your care after that. Most people can still do PT with that sized wound on that part of your leg. What are you looking for PT to help for you with? You can still do cardio and back exercises, you just keep a dressing on the wound. You can<APO>t get into their whirlpool perhaps, depending on what the doctor orders, but most people don<APO>t do that with PT anyway. Did they culture your wound, take a swab? To see what the infection is. What kind of antibiotics are you taking, for how long? Take care, Annette""This is standard procedure. The judge usually puts more weight into your own doctors statements, so be sure to have your own doctor document everything carefully in your record. Keep your appt. with their doctor and do anything he asks you to do as best you can. Do not be afraid to tell him if something is too hard or if it is likely to cause pain then or later. Take care, Annette""You just ask the pharmacist or tech to recount your pills right in front of you as you watch. They should have a private area where they counsel patients about new meds<APO> side effects, etc. This is an appropriate place to do the count. No doctor has ever asked me to turn in to him pills that I have already bought and paid for. If my doctor did, I would ask what they do with them, and I would probably ask to be present when they destroyed them, flushed them or whatever they do. If I was truly allergic, I wouldn<APO>t want them around anyway, but I have a problem with GIVING meds to a second party that they are not prescribed to. There may be a legality thing there, but it just does not sound right to me. I have had other drugs that gave me bad side effects, I just destroyed them myself. I understand diversion of schedule II and III drugs, but destroying them together sounds adequate to me. You can ask the doctor to write you two scripts of any new med, one for a week<APO>s worth, and one for the rest. That way you can try them out and see how they work, and if you have any ill effects from them before investing in 180 pills. Take care, Annette""Polypharmacy is just multiple medications. My pcp is the only doctor that I will accept any RX from. If I see a specialist, he writes a report and his recommendations to my pcp. Then I see her and we discuss his suggestions, but she writes the RXs. By the way, in many states it is a felony for a person to accept RX drugs from more than one doctor without telling all the doctors about all other RXs and doctors. These laws were passed so police could arrest addicts who had multiple controlled substance RXs from different doctors in their possession. Take care, Annette""It is already a felony in Oregon and Nevada, and maybe Calif. I think it is a good idea. It just lets people know that it is a serious problem. Take care, Annette""I was treated with prednisone for sciatica twice in about nine years. Both times it worked just fine. I took the pills for 10-14 days at the most. I looked up lithium in my drug handbook and there was no caution for use with prednisone or other steroids. It said that one must use caution when using lithium and NSAIDs together but not that you could NOT take them together. Have you ever tried them, with a doctor<APO>s supervision of course? What are all the meds you currently take? Take care, Annette""Actually, the Norco has the least amount of tylenol of all three of them. I have no explanation for the strange reaction this person had. Take care, Annette""You need to stop taking the meds this way and see your doctor. Tell him what is going on and work out a better treatment plan. Taking three of those pills at once means you are taking too much acetaminophen at one time, and too much per day while you are taking them. The 500 in the dose is for the amount of acetaminophen in the pill. One should never take more than 1,000 mg. at one time, or more than 4,000 mg. per 24 hour period. It can destroy your liver taken that way. Do not mix with alcohol either. You might ask the doctor about tramadol. Take care, Annette""That depends on where you live. Many states have the right to hire and fire employees for no reason at all. A friend of mine was fired by letter while she was out having chemo for breast cancer. She was a Master<APO>s prepared RN who had worked for that hospital for about 9 years. Great evaluations. Speak to a lawyer who does disability work, find out what your rights are, if any. Right now, just concentrate on getting better, and managing your pain as best you can. Take care, Annette""Explain that on work days you will only be taking them after you are off work. If that doesn<APO>t work, just ask him how you are supposed to manage the pain in his opinion. If doesn<APO>t know then ask to be referred out to a different pain management doctor. Take care, Annette""Many medicines are used for several different things. Topomax is an antiseizure med that is also used for migraines and other illnesses. If you want to know why your doctor prescribed it, you have to ask him. I like taking ""two fer"" meds, things that will help my migraines and my FMS both are great. Take care, Annette""Go see your doctor. Take care, Annette""I<APO>m Annette, I am a disabled, retired RN. I come here as a member of the community, I do not work for WebMD, and I am not here as a nurse caring for patients in any way. I am happy to share information and my experiences. Mine are somewhat different. We all come from different places in life. I have FMS, DDD, and migraines as my main diagnoses. I have a limited number of medical reference books that I am happy to use to look up stuff for people. I always tell everyone to discuss their meds with their doctors before changing anything, and to never change their treatment plans based on internet information without talking to their doctors. Welcome. Take care, Annette""Like the others said, it is very important that you come clean with your doctor about your use of street drugs, and get off of them. You are not a ""prior addict"" if you are using a friend<APO>s leftover methadone. I have worked the ER and I have worked with heroin addicts and other drug abusers, we always ask a person after an accident what drugs they take, if you did not tell them about your methadone use and use of other meds off the street, it is because you didn<APO>t choose to tell them, it did not just slip your mind. I understand your behavior, but you have to learn to be honest about it too. I am sorry, but your ""friend"" IS a dealer, unless he gives them to you for free, then he is a supplier, not much better, still illegal. No one who gets their meds because they need them, especially methadone, has leftovers enough to supply another person. Methadone is prescribed on a set schedule so one would have no leftovers. Your friend is the kind of person that makes it so difficult for the rest of us to get our much needed pain meds through our regular doctors and have to jump through all the hoops to get it. Hoops like drug screens, pill counts, contracts, and frequent office visits. You need to see a pain management doctor who has an addictions specialist to work with him for complicated patients like yourself. I don<APO>t know if you will get opiates meds at first. They may want you to clean up, and see just where your pain is and try other treatments first. That is what they usually do for chronic pain patients, so don<APO>t feel picked on because of your addiction history. If the usual treatments do not work, then they try more invasive treatments or opiates. Start going to NA meetings, and get straight with yourself and your loved ones. I have known lots of drug addicts over the years, and the ones who get good medical treatment are the ones who are honest with their doctors about EVERYTHING. You may have to see a few doctors to find one that fits well with you, but they are out there. By not being honest with your doctors about your use of illegal drugs you could have a fatal drug interaction or overdose. Your addiction is as serious a medical issue as anything that happened in your accident. Please treat this seriously and get help for the addiction. Take care, Annette""Discuss this with your doctor. Keep a journal about your headaches, when they start and when they end, all the foods you eat/drink, meds you take, activity level, and your periods. Take it to your doctor with you to try and figure out. Score each headache 0-10, 10 being the worst. Hormones can affect headaches as can many other things. Take care, Annette""if your GYN gave you a clean bill of health for your reproductive organs, then go back to your pcp and ask him/her where to go next. Keep a journal of when your pain starts, stops, etc, score it 0-10, write down everything you eat, when you move your bowels, and when you have your periods. When you see your pcp, he may refer you to a GI doc as that may be the next place to look. No moderate to severe pain should be ignored. There is no normal pelvic or abdominal pain, especially like you describe. Keep going back until they figure it out. If you give up on going back the doctor just assumes the pain went away or is tolerable. Take care, Annette""You are correct of course, my bad. They usually recommend either mixing them with kitty litter or used coffee grounds here where I live. (This is mainly to prevent diversion of scheduled drugs.) We don<APO>t have a cat and do not drink coffee, so I don<APO>t know what I should do, lol. Luckily, I have not had to dispose of meds in years. I am not going to buy a bag of kitty litter to dispose of a small amount of pills once every ten years or so. Storing it would be the hardest, I just do not have room in my apartment. Plastic bags from the grocery are also a problem in land fill, they just do not go away unless they are exposed to direct sunlight and they are usually buried in land fills. I have also heard there is a huge floating glob of plastic including grocery bags in the Pacific that interferes with the sea life. They are talking about outlawing the distribution of plastic bags from the grocery stores in my city as they have in several other cities. I have used reusable canvas bags for years when I shop, so I rarely have plastic bags laying around either. However, I recently read in the newspaper that either way you do it, they still end up in the water shed. If you flush it it goes right into the water system, and the treatment facilities do not remove drugs from the water. If you mix it and toss it in the garbage it still ends up in the land fill and from there it eventually goes into the ground water once the plastic bags degrade. They suggested returning them to your pharmacy and let them destroy them. But they also said that not all pharmacies will accept drugs to destroy. They suggested incineration might work, but cautioned that we don<APO>t know what happens to air quality as tests have not been done for that yet. Their closing remark was that this is an ongoing problem with no real answer as of yet. This recent article said to only order what you are going to use, and order small amounts of a new drug until you know for sure you will tolerate it okay so you prevent throwing drugs away to begin with. This is what I do as I think prevention is usually the best thing. Meanwhile, do what you think is best for you. Take care, Annette""The water treatment facilities were designed to remove feces, bacteria, etc. from water, they do not remove dissolved meds. The water is then cycled back to people through the water system, or into the ground water through agricultural use or home gardening use. Animals, birds, insects, etc. are exposed to the water in addition to people. We used to think it was no big deal, but when I was young the Calif. Condors and some other large birds of prey started going nearly extinct. They figured out that it was DDT from the ground water that went up the food chain through insects, rodents, etc. into the birds of prey, then it seemed to weaken their egg shells so their eggs broke and they did not have babies to raise. They banned DDT and the numbers of the large birds of prey came slowly back. I just read a bird count on the west coast that showed small birds of prey like sparrow hawks, and kestrels were losing ground now in one area on the coast. These birds eat mostly insects and some small rodents like field mice. The scientists are assuming that there is something else going up the food chain now, and are studying it to see what it is. Frankly, I worry more about birds of prey, being an old falconer, than I do about junkies, who know better, shooting up the juice squeezed out of dirty kitty litter to get high (like Greg suggested), lol. The birds have no way of knowing what is going on and have to eat. Take care, Annette""Long time no see. I did go to visit my son and his family for 2 weeks over Xmas. The little one is 3 1/2 now and the teenager is in high school this year. The younger one is a blast, he is talking and doing all the fun things that little ones do. I switched to methadone about a month before I went, and the switch over went well. I have less pain and function much better. It took less time to recover from my trip than when I was on the other med. I changed meds to avoid hitting the donut hole with Medicare D. I knew methadone was dirt cheap. But it also turned out that I have been able to discontinue two other meds that I was using for pain. My only reservation about the drug screens is the cost, I am hoping that Medicare picks up most of it. I know I take my meds as prescribed, so I can only hope the tests are accurate, lol. Be straight with your doctor, tell him the truth and adjust your treatment plan as you and he decide to. Only you can decide if you need to see him sooner than your scheduled appt. You have seen him for 7 yrs. now, I don<APO>t see why he wouldn<APO>t be glad to make any adjustments you need. It is so good to hear from you. Best of luck with the new baby. Take care, Annette""I disagree with the poster who blamed addicts for our problems getting meds. You blew it, you are taking responsibility for it, and that is a good thing. Now I would recommend you do as Greg suggests, find a new PM doc and be honest with him about what happened. It is a felony in many states to get pain meds from more than one doctor without telling them about each other, so please do not get yourself into further trouble. Ask your pcp for another referral. If he is willing to stand by what you said happened, there is really a good chance you will find another PM doctor. Do not try and hide this by picking up your own records and taking them yourself. You would have to edit your pcp<APO>s records to remove any mention of your pain doc who dismissed you. Doctors usually assume if a person brings in their own records without being asked, and refuses to provide a written, signed consent for information that they are hiding something. Do not believe anyone who guarantees you to be pain free after having a SCS implanted. You may get some relief, but many people must continue with their meds, perhaps at a lesser dose, perhaps not. Don<APO>t freak out, you will find a doctor who is willing to treat you as long as you follow the rules. Take care, Annette""Don<APO>t count on any surgery if you are still smoking. Don<APO>t count on hanging sheetrock if you have a low back problem, at least not for long. Don<APO>t count on being pain free if you have an SCS implanted. 1. Please quit smoking now, just in case you ever need any kind of orthopedic surgery in the future for your low back problems (or anything else). Bone often does not grow into a prosthesis, or a graft as long as one is smoking tobacco.. Many anesthesiologists do not like doing elective surgery on smokers at all, due to the respiratory risk. 2. You might consider becoming a construction supervisor, or an instructor in a trade school. Low back damage usually is progressive and eventually doing that kind of work, you will have to decide to do something different. 3. Most people who have SCSs implanted still need their oral pills, perhaps not as many or at the same doses, but I have frankly never heard of anyone becoming pain free. I would guess it happens, but I would do your research and see how probable it actually is, and how long it might last. I am not sure how long your SCS leads would stay in place doing your kind of work either, something to discuss with your doctor. Trust me, if you can learn to hang sheetrock proficiently, you can learn how to take pain meds properly. The meds are easier for me, because I am a nurse, but I know how hard your job is too, and you can learn to do the meds. You may need to write down a schedule at first, but it will soon become automatic. Read up on all your choices, get second opinions, and see non-interventionist PM doctors, as well as the doctors who do SCS and pump implants. After you get a good bit of information, discuss it all with your pcp and decide what is best for you. Take care, Annette""No one has ever tried to rob me of my meds. I<APO>ve been taking some kind of opiates for 15 years or more. Don<APO>t tell people you are taking pain pills, if anyone sees you take a pill and asks, tell them it is for high blood pressure or whatever. I only carry a couple of pills with me when I will be out of the house when they are due to be taken. When I travel I lock them in my suitcase, and only take out what I need, same as at home. At home you can lock them in a safe with a lock on it to keep kids out of it. Also no reason to tell your teenager exactly what kinds of meds you need to take. In a home with children and teenagers one should always keep all their meds, including over the counter ones, locked up to prevent accidental poisoning or to prevent teens from sharing with their friends. I raised a teenager once too, lol. See a multi-modality pain management treatment doctor who uses all kinds of things for pain management. Biofeedback, heat and cold packs, oral meds (of many kinds in addition to opiates), injections, PT, OT, cognitive therapy, TENS, etc. There are many different things to try. They have lots of options for you depending on your needs. I truly believe that if you get a small amount of relief from each of several treatments, the total amount of relief will be worthwhile. Take care, Annette""I think it is time to go see an MD or OD. If you are not feeling any relief with chiropractic after a few weeks, then move on. Start with your pcp, then go see an orthopedic specialist if necessary. Take care, Annette""Obviously, having an appt through an open door is just nuts. It makes no sense on any level. Either the doctor or the patient could have just worn a mask if there was any question of a respiratory illness that could have been passed from one to the other. That said, if the patient did not refuse to go along with this suggestion, and went ahead and discussed her business through an open door I feel she should take her share of the responsibility for that. I would tell him face to face that you felt uncomfortable with having the last appt. through the open door and in retrospect should have refused. See what he says. I would personally just find a new doctor, then dismiss the old one. Take care, Annette""Because FMS is not an inflammatory process, Ibuprofen does not usually help FMS pain much. Polychondritis is just a word that means multiple joints are swollen. Visibly swollen joints are not a part of FMS either, have you figured out yet why you have multiple swollen joints? I don<APO>t know if Ibuprofen would help that or not. I have never heard of Ibuprofen making pain and inflammation worse. Is your condition possibly just getting worse, despite the fact that you are taking Ibuprofen? Take care, Annette""Anyone who has this problem, Have you discussed with your doctor(s) not taking it at all? If it seems to make things worse instead of better, it would make sense to me to stop using it altogether. Take care, Annette""I<APO>m sorry, I just have never ever heard of cocaine helping get rid of back pain, other than by getting you too high to care. My first gut reaction whenever anyone tells me that the only drug that works for them is an illegal one, is that the person has a drug abuse problem and is trying to get some kind of drug legally. I have never heard of this rare chemical that is released when they do back surgery that may cause him to be paralysed. It would be interesting to read more about that if you have more info about where I could look it up. If he has already had a heart attack and feels that doing cocaine is okay regardless of the risk, but won<APO>t take opiates because they make him sick to his stomach, something is up. If he is seeing the best spine surgeon in Canada and has already had a second opinion there, I don<APO>t really see any advantage to coming to the US to see another surgeon. Take care, Annette""I think you mean calcium pyrophosphate. I looked it up and did not find anything that sounds remotely similar to what your husband has. How long have you been married? Were you present at the doctor<APO>s appts. where they told him about the risk of paralysis if he had surgery? Take care, Annette""I agree with you Charles. The risk of addiction is low, and not a reason to avoid trying opiates to see if they will work. However, perhaps because I worked with opiate addicts many years ago, I think it is still up to each of us not to pretend that addiction never happens to pain patients. It does, and we need to be aware just like we are aware of other possible side effects. If we just stop and think every time we take a pain pill and make certain that we are treating physical pain and not taking the pill to avoid any feelings or emotions, we will be doing ourselves a huge favor. Take care, Annette""If staying where you are to use their cognitive therapy program is a concern to you, and you do not want to stay there for the procedures they have suggested, then go home and get into a therapist who does cognitive therapy. I am a total believer in cognitive therapy. I went through it and find that it is one thing that I have continued to use over the years. You can learn the techniques with a therpaist, then you can use them whenever you want to. You carry them for life. NO side effects. Why would you not want to ""rush"" into therapy if it might help decrease your pain? Regarding ""scar tissue"" and ""potential nerve impingement"" that you have read about here. I have only read about it as concerned with surgical use of metal implants, not with radio-frequency ablation. Maybe I need to go back and read the posts again, or maybe you do, or maybe we both should. What did the Cleveland Clinic doctor say about your risks with this treatment? He is the one to listen to. As far as the implant that calms your pudendal nerve, is that an implant that can be shut off if you wish to, or does it make pregnancy impossible forever regardless? I know the SCS implant can be turned off or adjusted, but I don<APO>t know about this unit. I will have to go read about that. The Cleveland Clinic doctor is right to go from least intrusive treatment to more intrusive treatment. Did this guy make any recommendations about oral meds? When to start them, if you should continue them, change them, etc.? Why would your current doctor at home be against you having the radiofrequency ablation and discontinue your care (and meds) against your wishes? I do not understand why he would be against you doing what the Cleveland Clinic doctors suggested just because you go home to have it done. I have gone out of town for consultations at a large medical center in the past, UCSF Medical Center in San Francisco. They made their suggestions and were happy to have me take them home to my own doctor. They are used to that. My doctor back home was happy to get their input, then he and I decided what to try next. I am not sure what you want. You pretty much have reasons not to do anything they suggested so far. Do you just want someone to give you more meds? Being honest is best. Don<APO>t waste everyones<APO> time and energy, if you know exactly what you want already. Take care, Annette""That is not what I learned when I learned cognitive behavioral therapy. I learned it is a way of changing your thinking so that you do not jump from one negative thing to another, only even worse and end up feeling worse, pain-wise and emotion-wise. I hate to say it is as simple as positive thinking, but that would be the most simplistic way of putting it. My therapist taught me the other things you mentioned except biofeedback, but those were separate things, also helpful. How we choose to think can affect our emotions and our pain levels. This is the basis of CBT as I learned it. For example, when we think in a catastrophic manner, then we may assume if we are in pain, it will only get worse, and it will last forever, our meds won<APO>t work, and neither will anything else. My pain will get worse, I will end up depressed and commit suicide. If I think like that, then my pain WILL get worse. On the other hand, if I think calmly, I have had this kind of pain before, if I take a BT pain pill, sit in the hot tub, do some stretches, it has always gotten better in 30-45 minutes. Then, I do just that, and 9 times out of 10, it does get better in 30-45 minutes. That then re-enforces that particular way of thinking. At first it seems very artificial. But later on, it just flows naturally. There are other methods that were taught that help as well. I just had to learn to change the progression of my thought patterns. The book, ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns, MD worked great for me. My therapist gave it to me when I moved out of town. Best thing I ever learned. Take care, Annette""I would do your own research and see if there are any problems associated with pregnancy and the pudendal nerve stimulator. Your OB doesn<APO>t know, and I am not surprised, because these kinds of interventions are fairly new and not that common in childbearing women. Does your current PM doc know you are at the Cleveland Clinic now? If you have been approved to attend the Cleveland Clinic pain management program for one month, aren<APO>t you going to have to tell your pm doc back home where you are? I have heard of doctors only wanting their patients to get narcotics from them and not from other doctors, but I hadn<APO>t heard about a doctor who would discharge a patient whose pain he could not get under control for getting a second opinion from a specialty clinic. There are weird ones out there though, I might have just been lucky enough to miss that doctor and others like him. You did not mention your meds at all as being under discussion at the Cleveland Clinic. You have mentioned them in other posts, you were worried that your present PM doc would cut you off. It is just another treatment option that was clearly not mentioned, that surprised me. Getting an increase of meds would not be for the ""sake of getting more narcotics"", it would be for the sake of increasing your function and comfort. I worked with addicts in the past, and believe me they are not grinning and waving most of the time. It is a horrible illness, both attaining the drugs for illegal use, withdrawals when you cannot, and all the complications of addiction. Certainly they contribute to the difficulty in patients with chronic pain getting adequate drugs, but so does the chronic pain patient who lies to their doctor, obscures old records, is also an addict and does not disclose that to their doctor. I would rather be a chronic pain patient than an addict. I believe it is better to try and be a part of the solution than it is to blame other sick people. Just my opinion, we all have one. Take care, Annette""Headaches are often difficult to diagnose. Many times doctors give a patient a drug, and see what happens, when the patient goes back and tells the doctor that medicine did or did not help, that assists him in figuring out a diagnosis. The drug you were given by the doctor who ""misidagnosed"" you, is often helpful for both tension and migraine headaches. Everything you described except ""blackout spells"" could easily be described by many people with migraines, and some people with tension headaches. By ""blackout spells"" do you mean you actually passed out, unconscious on the floor, more than once? This is what I would think if you told me that. I would consider this a medical emergency for me, and I would go to the ER with someone else driving or in an ambulance. If someone passed out in front of me, I would call 911, and I am an RN. If by ""blackout spells"" you mean your vision went black and you felt dizzy momentarily, but you did not hit the floor, that would be completely different, and not nearly as important a symptom. If you are having all those symptoms, I would make an appt. to see your regular doctor, or a neurologist to help figure out what is going on. If you have had a regular doctor for several years, I strongly suggest you see him, as he knows you fairly well by now. Take care, Annette""Most things more serious than muscle strains will show up in an MRI or Xray. Most muscle strains will go away after 9 months of treatment, except you have not done ALL your treatment plan, since you have not gone to PT yet. If some of your activities restrain your muscles or keep it from healing, you could be dealing with some kind of repetitive injury. If I were you, I would go to PT and get busy. Take care, Annette""Look at your daily activities and see if anything you are doing might be aggravating the painful area. Best of luck. Take care, Annette""You need to interview your next PM doc at the first visit. Bring in what you have already tried, and written records from your previous surgeons stating they do not recommend surgery. Tell him that you have been on your current meds 2x a day for however long you have been on them and they no longer work. Ask him what he has to offer you, if all he has to offer is what does not work not, do not see him again. I would not even make an appt. with an interventionist PM doc, they are the ones that only do injections and procedures, because what you seem to be seeking is better medical care. Surgeons do surgery, so I would not bother with any more of those, you have seen 2-3 already. A multidisciplinary PM doc that uses many treatments including oral meds aggressively seems most appropriate. There are other oral meds, antidepressants, and antiseizure drugs (they also work for pain, not just what they were originally made for) in addition to stronger or longer lasting opiates available for pain management. Although the current PM doc started out with the same old drug, now that you have had a chance to get to know each other, he may go further with meds for you if you ask. I don<APO>t know what your job is exactly or if certain drugs are not allowed at your job. It may be necessary to choose between your current job and additional drugs. Your pcp may also be able to manage this for you, now that the surgery has been ruled out. Committing suicide is a permanent solution (for you, not your loved ones) for what is usually a temporary problem. I am disabled due to painful conditions, and have been for a long time. I am really happy most of the time. I enjoy my life, even though I can no longer work. I never thought I would say that, but it is true. Please discuss your depression with your pcp, and see a psychiatrist, a therapist, or use antidepressant meds if needed. If you are really considering suicide, please call 911 or your own doctor or a hot line right away. Take care, Annette""I have DDD in my neck and have had one discectomy back in 1992. I love doing a bit of steroids to get rid of my neck pain every now and again. It usually works very well. They contain a powerful anti-inflammatory and kick the pain down really well. I would not use them all the time, as they have their own side effects when used daily for long term. But the occasional dose pack (once or twice a year) was great for me. I don<APO>t know why you didn<APO>t want to try the dose pack? Take care, Annette""I am sorry, but you describe yourself as an ""addict"" in your personal profile. You don<APO>t specify opiate addict, so perhaps your drug(s) of choice weren<APO>t opiates. That really does not matter, as most addicts float freely from one drug addiction to another as they are chasing something that does not exist in real life, complete freedom from the emotions that make them uncomfortable. I have also read some of your posts on the Addiction Board and you also refer to yourself as an addict there. Trying to treat chronic pain and addiction in one person is very difficult, I wish you and your doctor the best. There is no shame in addiction, it is just another illness. But, I usually see addicts in recovery relapse when they try to remake themselves and claim they were never addicts to begin with. Be careful. Take care, Annette""This is not something that someone can just read back to you in layman<APO>s terms. In addition to the report, the actual film or DVD, the doctor must also examine you and take a medical history. After he has all that info, he can put it together and tell you what you most likely have and how to proceed in treating it. It is not something any of us are capable of doing on line. If the doctor who ordered this test will not be seeing you again because he does not agree with your current PM treatment program, take the report, film and/or DVD, to your current PM doctor and he can explain them to you. Take care, Annette""I had a anterior discectomy back in 1992, it fused on its own within 5-6 months after surgery. I did not have a surgical fusion done at the time of surgery by my choice when the neurosurgeon gave me my options. I do not smoke, so I felt a basic discectomy was fine for me. I was back to work as a full time ER nurse without restrictions other than not lifting above my shoulders 6 weeks after the surgery. I was told back then that I could not lift anything higher than my shoulders, ever again. My surgeon frowned on me continuing to ride my horse, for fear of being thrown off. I can<APO>t imagine being told I could continue contact sports if that was an issue. You are only 5 months out from surgery. It takes a full year to heal from any operation. I would imagine your surgeon is still seeing you, they usually see a patient for a full year after surgery for postop visits. I would make an appt. and see him in person and explain just how you feel, and ask what you can still expect to change. I would see a neurologist and ask what he would recommend non-surgically. Then I would see a neurosurgeon (not connected to your current surgeon) for a second opinion to see what he would suggest. After you collect all that information, process it through your mind and see what your options are. Take care, Annette""I have not used this med. I am certain that people who have will respond to your post. All I wanted to say was try to be a little patient. Give yourself some time to adjust to this new drug. Pain varies from hour to hour, day to day for me. I can go a few days with no BT meds at all, and then need them for a few days or weeks, lol. Take the BT meds as directed, and let your doctor know how you are doing before the end of the week if things do not get better. Take care, Annette""Lots of women have been through an entire pregnancy without meds and with chronic pain. We all do what we decide to do after weighing all our options. You are talking about 15 days until your induction, you can do it!!! You have already cut your daily dose of Kadian in half. So, all you need to do is cut one more dose a day, and you will be at 30 mg.- 2x a day. I would suggest a heating pad to your painful areas on your leg(s), or ice packs if that works better for you. Both should be done through a towel so you don<APO>t damage your skin. Gentle movement so you don<APO>t get stiff, at least 2-3 times a day. Be sure and move all your joints to their fullest extent. My hubby massages my feet for me when my pain is terrible, I find that disrupts the pain signals and I only feel the good massage. You might also talk to your OB about hot showers or baths before you try them. Some pregnant women should avoid hot baths. You WILL have pain, but it is only for the next 15 days, then you will have a wonderful baby, and be too busy, and too tired to worry. It is up to you to decide if you will breastfeed or for how long, and you and your doctor have to figure out what meds are okay, and when if you are going to breastfeed, as most of them do cross over into breast milk. Do NOT listen to all the do-gooders who will tell you that breast is best, and try to guilt you into it. It is best, but not all women can do it. There are other options. That is between you and your doctor. If you need your meds to control your pain so you can raise this wonderful baby, then you may not be able to breastfeed. Or you may not be able to breastfeed as long as you would wish to otherwise. Lots of kids are raised without breast milk at all, and turn into wonderful, healthy people. Ask your pediatrician what to do to give your baby the best leg up in life that you can reasonable give. The pediatricians have all kinds of things to do for babies that do go through withdrawal. Since they know what meds you have taken during your pregnancy, they will know what to look for in the baby, and how to deal with it. Having a baby is a miracle in any situation, try your best to enjoy your miracle. Please let us know how things go. Hugs, Annette""I knew you had already done most of the treatments there are. Make sure you write those all down in a list to take with you to your doctor. He needs to know how active you have been in seeking your pain relief. Reread those two books, they really helped me a lot. Improved my attitude and that made it easier to talk to my doctor. I just approach the pain the same as I would any other symptom. I think we are so used to being freaked out about asking for better or more pain meds that we do ourselves and our doctors a disservice. If we start out the conversation with our doctors crying and moaning it just makes the conversation uncomfortable for both of us. By speaking matter of factly and asking outright for what we need I think we get better care. Vent to me anytime. I wish I was of more help than I am. Hugs, Annette""I<APO>m sorry but a total of 90 mg. a day is not that high a dose of morphine, at least not as far as I am concerned. When I switched over to my new drug I was taking 60 mg. of long acting morphine twice a day, plus BT meds. I would ask him about rotating to a different opiate if he feels that would be better than increasing the morphine. Perhaps that would help you. It sure did me, and I only changed for financial reasons, lol. I got better relief, and better function, too. There are no studies that I know of that have shown that any one narcotic is better than another as far as relief goes, or side effects. That said, I have known patients who just did better on one opiate than another for whatever reason. Usually I think it is due to the dosing, but it is also due to partial cross tolerance. Have you told him flat out that you just do not have the money for the SCS at this time in your life? ""Can<APO>t do it, try me on something else?"" Have you tried the TENS unit, Lidoderm patches, cognitive therapy, all the other options out there? You should be doing a whole variety of treatments. I think you have been pretty good about doing all that already, but ask him if there is anything else you can do. If he says there is nothing more he can do for you, ask him to refer you to another PM doc who uses meds more than injections and procedures. Your appt. sheets that state your pain levels and levels of function should clearly show him that you are not progressing and need a treatment adjustment. Everyone is different as far as what their pain scales show, and what activity levels they have with that kind of pain. I generally tolerate scores of 5-7 all the time and spikes of 8-10 occasionally, as long as I have access to treatments like my hot tub, TENS, Lidoderm patches, and BT meds in addition to my regular long acting opioid. Someone else may not be able to tolerate scores that high and still function, others can tolerate more pain than I can. Use this snowstorm while you are stuck inside anyway, and write down exactly what your goals are in the pain management area, and what your scores and activities have been like lately. I really believe in approaching doctors for more aggressive treatment of their pain by telling the doctor what they are, and are not, able to do at this point due to their pain interfering in their life. By approaching him with goals and function discussions rather than saying ""I am in terrible pain all the time"" I hope you will get better treatment from him. I would see him as soon as possible, call and make an extra appt. if possible. That lets a doctor know that the patient is really bothered by what is going on. If he is just an interventionist who was willing to give you meds for awhile to suck you into his practice, and he really wants to do this SCS surgery, and you don<APO>t have the money for it, you two may just be butting heads together and there may not be a real solution with this doctor. I don<APO>t know, because I don<APO>t know him. I am doing okay. My cousin died, and his sister<APO>s husband died three weeks later. Some other family stuff too. I am really tired, but other than that, I am okay. Thanks for asking. Hugs, Annette""That depends on what came up on the drug screen. I would talk to your pcp and see if he will write your prescriptions until you find some one else, or permanently for that matter. If not, then ask him how to manage a tapering of the opiates you do have. Usually a months supply of drugs is enough to do a proper taper. Take care, Annette""All you can do is be honest with all the doctors concerned. You will find someone who will give you a second chance. Take care, Annette""Please remember that pot is illegal everywhere as far as the feds are concerned, although Obama said he has asked the Feds to lay off of medical marijuana users. In the states that have legalized medical use of marijuana, many have specific requirements for use, including getting a card or license from the state by specifying why you need it. Here you also have to have a doctor recommend that you use it in writing. In my state medical use of marijuana is legal, with a card from the state. Even then, if you have a contract with your doctor saying you will only use the drugs he prescribes, and he does not prescribe the marijuana for you, he can ethically discharge you from his practice if he learns through a drug screen that you have used it. Take care, Annette""This drug is not used much anymore as the body breaks it down into metabolites that can easily cause toxicity and even seizures. It was used more frequently some years ago before we had so many other choices and before we knew so much about the Demerol. I have not seen any good, double blind studies that show any one opioid is better than another or that the side effect profile is better with one than another. I feel it is all a matter of the individual and mainly the proper dosing. I don<APO>t think it is a good idea to name drugs that you would like to try for your doctor unless you know that would be welcome. Just remind him of your functional and occupational needs. About twelve years ago, when I was still working as an ER nurse, I did as your doctor suggested and took my meds as soon as my shift ended. Nowadays, most states are better educated about pain management, and studies have shown that more occupational errors are made due to pain, than due to the meds that treat it. At least that is what the state board of nursing told me recently. They said that as long as a nurse discusses her meds with her employer and it is okay with them, it is fine to work on pain management meds. They suggested the nurse adjust her meds when she will be able to take some time off work so she can see how she will respond tot he change. Makes sense to me. They told me they have plenty of nurses with chronic pain problems that are able to continue to work with the right meds. That said, there are still jobs with restrictions on working while taking many kinds of meds. Take care, Annette""That is sacroiliac joint dysfunction. That is the joint in the hip between the sacrum (spine just above the coccyx/tail bone) and the iliac bone (pelvic crest bone). I agree, go see a civilian doctor if possible and ask them to explain all the films to you. Take the films copies with you. Then ask what they would recommend you try. Then think about it. Are you still in the military? Do you have military health benefits? Take care, Annette""I would go with her, and explain to the doctor her lack of function due to increasing pain. You may not even have to ask for more meds. Just explain how your wife<APO>s pain interferes with her ability to enjoy life and get things done. Ask the doctor how she/he can help your wife with this. Take care, Annette""Ditto what Gail said. Take care, Annette""Once you get yourself set up with your pcp or another pain management doc for your PM care/meds, just write a letter to your current PM doc and let him know you are leaving, and where to send your records if you so desire. The pain medicine contract is just a written agreement between the two of you, once you are established with another doctor, and leave this guy<APO>s care you don<APO>t need to worry about it. Just keep your word with the next doc as you have with this one. I do not understand the business about turning in your paid for meds to the doctor, and getting a RX for new meds. I would not feel comfortable doing that after I paid for them, and without seeing them destroyed in front of me. I certainly would not recommend keeping schedule II drugs around the house that I could not use anyway, but just handing them over to someone in RX bottles with my name on them is crazy. No doctor I have known does that. I do understand that some PM doctors only treat spinal pain, or whatever, and you are a very complicated patient. I saw a PM doc who knew nothing about migraines, one of my problems, he just told me that straight out and suggested I see my pcp for the migraines. Your doc just does not sound right to me, I would ask your pcp what to do. Take care, Annette""Most places wouldn<APO>t even bother to read 76 pages of documentation. I always had my doctors write letters that were no more than a page or two long but very specific to what the drug companies asked for. If they won<APO>t go for that, you may have to do the step program or do like on person said and get free or discounted drugs from the brand name company<APO>s consumer assistance program. Take care, Annette""Look on the patch RX package and find the name of the manufacturer, call and get their 800 number, then call the company and ask for their patient assistance program. They are the ones to help you. Take care, Annette""No offense intended, but I think your doctor was just being lazy. It is easier for her to tell her office staff to copy the chart and send it, than it is for her to compose and send a letter herself. If she is flat out refusing to work with you regarding the meds and insurance, I don<APO>t think she is working in your best interest either. If you cannot get the patches due to financial issues, then you won<APO>t be using anything at all. Does she think that is the best thing for you? It is too late to get your file back, they would just copy it anyway. I would not worry much about that though. Try and just get your own health needs met for now. Take care, Annette""If you have already done the drugs on their ""step up"" program and they didn<APO>t work, ask your doctor to write another letter, specifying exactly what pain drugs you have used and how they did not work. It may be the way your doctor worded his last letter, he may not have addressed the concerns the insurance company has about the other drugs you have tried. Many Part D programs require ""step up"" programs for more expensive drugs. They ARE insurance companies, they MAKE money for their shareholders, so they want to keep costs down. If it is just a matter of trying morphine and methadone first, then, give them a try. It shouldn<APO>t take longer than 3-4 weeks. I used a generic long acting morphine for about ten years and it worked fine for me. I switched to methadone last year because it was even cheaper and in my Part D program, I did not want to hit the donut hole. It also works fine for me, probably even better than the morphine. Since you are getting extra help due to your low income status, you have to follow their rules. If you wish to change to a different Part D company and pay your own premium you can do that during the regular time of year where they do the enrollments, according to the Part D rules. The fentanyl patch is pretty expensive from what little I know about it. I have never used it as I love to sit in my hot tub. Meanwhile, use any free time to lobby your legislators to go to a single-payer health care program, and get rid of for-profit insurance companies altogether. I truly believe that is the kind of health care reform we really need. Take care, Annette""It is not that easy. There is only a partial cross tolerance between opioids. They usually recommend when switching from one to another that you start out at about 50% of the equianalgesic dose. Your doctor has conversion tools to figure that out. If you start out at the full equianalgesic dose, you may overdose on the new drug. Your doctor hopefully knows you and can figure out the best dose for you. This is where medicine truly is an art. Then you adjust the new drug as needed to control your pain. I found within a week or two I was fine on the methadone. Meanwhile I used my BT meds as needed for extra pain. I didn<APO>t have any withdrawal symptoms, there is no reason to worry about that. Kadian is a brand name long acting morphine, it will still be rather expensive. If you are switching to morphine, I would suggest a generic long acting one. I took one for about ten years, no physical problems with it, I just wanted to go cheaper. I switched from a generic long acting morphine to methadone when I switched from private insurance to Medicare Part D. Methadone is about the cheapest of all the opioids. I hopefully will avoid going into the donut hole this way and having to pay for my own meds. Methadone works great for me, actually better than the morphine did. It is very complicated figuring out Part D. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Please see your doctor for this. We cannot see you to do an examination, feel the lump, etc., So no matter how experienced we are, this format is very limiting. Take care, Annette""A friend of mine works at a generic drug company in the complaint department. She told me they keep back a portion of each lot of drugs that goes out. All you have to do is call and they can test the pills from your lot number to see if they are accurately dosed. Take care, Annette""I tend to agree with Peskypain on this, I think most of it is in ones mind. I have used all kinds of drugs, both generic and brand name, and have never found any difference at all. I currently use all generics, they are cheap and I am a happy customer. I always buy the store brand of over the counter meds, and have found they work fine also. For me there is no difference between Tylenol and acetaminophen, or Motrin and ibuprofen. Take care, Annette""I agree with Beth. I have taken generics for many years, since they first became widely available and patients were given a choice. I have had many different generics of various pain meds. I could not tell any difference myself. I do agree, if you have a problem, report it to the number provided for the FDA. The drug companies keep some drugs from every ""lot"" they make, for testing if there are any complaints. My daughter-in-law used to work for a big generic drug manufacturer in Southern California. Take care, Annette""I have used generic Norcos for many years, including the maker you mentioned. About six different ones all together I think. I cannot tell any difference, They all work about the same for me. Perhaps your pain was just better for other reasons. According to the FDA, all generics must be the same drug, in the same number of mgs., and work the same in the same length of time as the brand name drug. I believe this to be true of all the different generics I have used over the years, both for this med, and others. Binders are inactive ingredients. Take care, Annette""I have been on pain meds of various types for 15 years or so. I have been on the Norcos you describe, yellow, and white tablets and several other generic ones. The pharmacist where I went always pointed out any change of generic brands. I NEVER noticed any difference in efficacy with any of them. Sometimes my pain was worse, and sometimes it was better, but it was my pain that changed, not that the meds were different. Keeping a careful pain diary showed me that. If you notice a difference, take whatever you feel like, but be prepared to pay for it if your insurance company requires it. I get generic drugs for free with my current insurance company, and pay heftily for brand name drugs. Take care, Annette""Hi, I take all generic drugs now, so that should tell you how I feel about them. Go to the FDA.gov website and check up on generics and what they have to do, be, etc. They are essentially identical to brand name drugs. The in-active ingredients or fillers are in-active, so I don<APO>t really care if they are the same or slightly different. I guess if one was highly allergic to the fillers it might matter, but that is very rare. Hospitals are in it for the $$ so I am sure 90% of the pills I handed out in my RN days were generic. I have never seen a difference at all. Take care, Annette""I have used both Watson and Mallincroft generics of Norco 10/325, I did not have any different reaction to them. They both worked as expected, fine. I think it is very difficult with pain meds to tell if you are having an increase in pain for some other reason, or if it is actually the meds. In any case, as long as you are willing to pay the difference in cost, most insurance companies don<APO>t care if you get the brand name stuff, or a particular generic company. My best to your Auntie. Take care, Annette""As usual you are absolutely correct. Hugs, Annette""If that seems to be useful to you, I am glad you were able to get the brand name stuff at last. Take care, Annette""I always use generic store brands of acetaminophen and ibuprofen, because it is the same thing for a lot less money. I have never noticed any difference. Drugs are not cheesecakes, they are regulated by the FDA. The generics are tested using double blind studies to make certain they work the same way as the brand name drugs. Anyone who wants to pay the extra $$$ for brand name drugs should feel free to do so, just don<APO>t expect the rest of us to subsidize your meds. I agree with you, everyone should do as they wish, as long as they pay for it. Take care, Annette""You should always bring new symptoms to the doctor<APO>s attention. Take care, Annette""I believe that all the schedule III opiate drugs are mixed with tylenol or ibuprofen. This makes them less likely to be abused, more difficult to dissolve and shoot up. Most opiates that fall in the schedule II category can be had as single drug formulas. Either long acting or short acting. As far as scheduling travel, some doctors will write for 90 day supplies of opiates and some insurance companies will fill them. Otherwise I can only suggest your doctor give you multiple 30 day RXs to fill, you take the first one with you after filling it, and you have someone at home fill the rest for you while you are gone, then mail them to you overnight mail each month. I switched to methadone in November as it is much cheaper than the drug I was on before that. I also took my time switching over, and I have found it to be a good drug for my pain. I ended up taking it every 8 hours, as that is about as long as I had good pain relief. Everyone responds to each drug differently. The WalMart where I live does not fill opiates at all on their cheap generic plan. I use Medicare Plan D for my drugs. Take care, Annette""Talwin NX is a schedule IV drug according to my drug book. It is mixed with naloxone, a narcotic antagonist. I have not seen it used much for many years now. When plain Talwin was first used they marketed it as totally non-abusable. We quickly learned that was not true, so they mixed it with naloxone. That way if someone tries to dissolve it and shoot it up, they don<APO>t get the euphoria that they got with plain Talwin. It lowers the seizure threshold, that may be one reason they stopped using it so much. Take care, Annette""The diagnosis of FMS is more than just feeling tired and in pain all day long. The doctor should have done a tender point exam, many doctors do this without saying anything, just by pressing on various parts of your body during your physical exam. If you have 11 out of 18 positive tender points, that is a positive sign. You must also have widespread pain in at least three of the four quadrants of your body lasting at least three months. Then the doctor does a bunch of lab and possibly other tests to determine that you do NOT have another illness that could cause similar symptoms. If they come back normal and the other symptoms lead to FMS, it probably is FMS. I don<APO>t think that experienced rheumys make a lot of misdiagnoses of FMS. Less well trained pcps might. Take care, Annette""Ask your doctor why he feels you have FMS. The rheumy diagnosed you, he should have a basis for that diagnosis. If he has a real basis,then he should be able to tell you. I would get a second opinion as I would for any chronic condition. I don<APO>t know about the grieving process being any big deal. It is mainly dealing with the loss of your former healthy self, if you already have other health issues, you have probably already dealt with that. Take care, Annette""if you wish to see a doctor, just Google ""free/low cost clinics in the Seattle, WA area"". Or call Goodwill, Salvation Army, Catholic Charities, etc. and ask them what is available there. Take care, Annette""All those drugs can actually trigger rebound headaches. You need to see a doctor. Write down all the symptoms you are currently having along with the dates of when they started. You are right, you may need to see a doctor more than once to sort it all out. Take care, Annette""You need to have this discussion with your doctor. Clearly after having a GI bleed, the naproxyn is no longer a good idea. I am not sure what the point of changing from gabapentin to Lyrica was they are very close tot he same thing chemically, but maybe the Lyrica will work better for you. The drunken, blurry feeling may well go away after a few weeks, many side effects do. I did not find that Lyrica worked any better, and opted to go back to gabapentin, but I also use other meds in addition. Take care, Annette""The question you are asking yourself is not quite the correct one. You should be asking yourself if you are taking the meds for the physical pain for which they were prescribed, rather than for any other reason, including headaches, panic attacks, etc. Narcotics are not the best meds for headaches of any kind except in very rare cases, when all other headache meds did not work. Narcotics can cause increased headaches, even chronic daily headaches. They are also not the correct meds for panic attacks, or sleep. Have you discussed these concerns with your doctor? He is the one to help you figure out just what meds you may need for what problems. You are mentioning a number of concerning things regarding addiction. People with addiction and alcoholism can require pain meds, but should only get them under the supervision of both the doctor treating the pain, and an addiction specialist. Only folk who are solidly into their recovery program should even think about taking opiates for pain, and then only after trying all the other options for pain management. Please discuss this all with your doctor, not your family/friends. I opt not to discuss my meds with anyone but my husband and my doctor. It really is not any of their business, most people do not discuss the details of their meds with everyone they know. Take care, Annette""Panic attacks and seizures are very different things, but neither are generally treated with pain pills. Withdrawal symptoms vary from person to person, but opiates shouldn<APO>t cause withdrawal symptoms for more than a few weeks max. Discuss these symptoms with your doctor, not all these other people. We can visit with you on line, and try and share our experiences with you, but we cannot diagnose your feelings as physical or emotional, that is up to your doctor. Take care, Annette""There are better and more effective drugs for these kinds of problems than opiates. Please discuss this with your doctor. Take care, Annette""Sorry, but opiates are not the best drugs for migraines and panic attacks. These two symptoms may or may not be related to your chronic pain. Share this with your doctor. Take care, Annette""Don<APO>t have a conversation about getting high. Just explain tot he doctor that you have what you believe to be depression, panic attacks, and migraines and ask for help with those. Don<APO>t even mention using your opiates to self-treat those feelings if you don<APO>t trust your doctor. Save it for later, or never. You may be able to get better, more specific meds for your emotional issues, and you should still be able to take whatever opiates you actually need for your chronic pain. Why would you not want to get the right medical treatment for your emotional issues? It is not a matter of ""having a desire"" to use your opiates more than is strictly necessary, it is a matter of what you actually do. If you never use them for anything other than what they are prescribed for, then you have nothing to worry about. If you do, you are an adult, make your own choices. Take care, Annette""Everything you say is correct for someone taking pain meds for physical pain. Spencer, however, seems very conflicted about whether he is taking them for physical pain, of for emotional problems, like depression, panic attacks, etc. I would be concerned if he were my friend or brother. Take care, Annette""People in pain can still get high by taking high doses of opiates. Most of us never get that much medicine or have never taken large doses of our medicines. I believe that it is a myth that people in pain cannot get high, and cannot get addicted. Opiate addiction is very rare in chronic pain patients, but it does happen occasionally. From reading Spencer<APO>s posts, it sounds like he wants to treat his emotional issues with opiates. He may also need opiates for his physical pain, but that doesn<APO>t seem to be the issue. Take care, Annette""The migraines may not be related to the fall out of the tree at all, just coincidence that they started about the same time. Get a work up and then start the long, tiring process of looking for the right medicine combo that works for you. Pain pills are NOT the answer for migraines. Ask for migraine specific meds if you have migraines. Pain pills can cause increased headaches until you end up with chronic daily headaches. Take care, Annette""I would get a second opinion, and ask all your questions of both doctors, and compare their responses. Be sure you understand ALL the answers to your questions before you consent to the procedure. Take care, Annette""Have you tried PT and acupuncture? A reputable doctor usually won<APO>t just give opiates to anyone who walks in his door with an MRI and old RX. Give him a couple of visits to get to know you and he may well write your RXs for you. Trust goes both ways, you have to get to know each other. If you post your email address, people can respond about doctors in that area, we are not allowed to post names, etc. here. I am on the west coast, so I can<APO>t help you with that. Take care, Annette""From what I have read, if you continue to take a stronger opiate like percocet, your tolerance level will not return to what it was when you were first taking the weaker opiate. My old rheumatologist, who managed my pain meds for awhile, told me that if I wanted to I could go on a opiate holiday, and not take any opiates at all to lower my tolerance back to what it was before I took any opiates at all. He suggested taking no opiates for 5 days. He was also happy to just increase my opiates to reduce my pain. He was willing to go whichever way I chose to go. I opted to go up. Any sedation that the new opiate you decide to take will usually go away after a week or two of taking it daily. That is an expected side effect of opiates, and many other drugs as well. You can contact the drug companies that make your meds and ask them if they have an assistance program to help you with the cost of your meds since you don<APO>t have insurance any more. Places like WalMart and Target also have drug assistance programs for certain drugs. Ask their pharmacist what he might suggest for you. Take care, Annette""They are very close in strength, most people feel better relief with the percocet than with the hydrocodone. However, some folks get better relief from the hydrocodone. Check out all the different drug programs, most pharmacies will not come out and tell you about them unless you ask before you hand them your RXs. Take care, Annette""There is no one here qualified to read imaging studies for you. Please see your doctor. Take care, Annette""Don<APO>t worry about it. Some of the boards have medical people who monitor them and some do not. This one does not. Come back and visit again. Take care, Annette""I would go to www.myalgia.com, they have a good article there about how to handle surgery if you already have FMS. I would discus the lumbar fusion with at least a second opinion doctor before doing it. I would also get the FMS under good control first, rather than doing the surgery when you are in the midst of a FMS flare. Just my opinion. Take care, Annette""Also, any signs of a stroke should get you calling 911 right away. Slurred speech, facial droopiness, weakness on one side of the body, inability to speak/swallow, etc. The ambulances have a lot of equipment and meds on board as well as a radio link to a doctor, so please don<APO>t think you can get to the hospital faster. They have meds at the ER that can actually interrupt a stroke and prevent brain damage, just like they can inject the IV meds that save heart tissue from dying during a heart attack. My OB doctors always said if you were having enough vaginal bleeding to saturate one pad per hour you should go to the ER and have them call your doctor. One should switch to pads and not use tampons if one is having abnormal bleeding. Take care, Annette""I agree with Shawna. I really believe we do not remember things as accurately as we think we do. Writing everything down as it happens is much better. Later when you go over your journal either alone or with your doctor you may find trends or specific things that affect your pain. Take care, Annette""The strength of the medication doesn<APO>t particularly matter as the doctor orders each med by the amount of pain you seem to be in and the amount of meds you are already taking. Everyone will react to meds slightly differently. My doctor offered my Duragesic patches back when I started using long acting opiates, but I adore my hot tub, as it is the only thing that gives me 100% relief. It may only last as long as I am sitting in the tub, but I know it will make me feel better for that long. Meds work well, but they don<APO>t get rid of 100% of my pain, maybe about 80%. I like having my hot tub as an option. The instructions for fentanyl patches say to stay out of hot tubs as it affects how quickly the medicine is absorbed into your system. Sometimes I sit in mine for up to an hour. At the time, morphine was the only long acting opiate available besides methadone in generic. My doctor didn<APO>t prescribe a lot of methadone, I would prefer to get it from a doctor with lots of experience. So, I opted for morphine. It has worked well for me for about 9 years now. If I ever lost my insurance, I would switch to methadone as it is much cheaper. I really don<APO>t think it matters much for most people which long acting opiate they take, it is the dose and scheduling that is important. Good communication with the doctor will help more than anything. I don<APO>t know what is causing the hives and rash that you have. The doctor should take a careful history and try and figure it out for you. Keep a careful journal and note the times you take your meds and when the rash gets worse or better. Opiates will cause itching as a side effect, but not a rash unless you are truly allergic to it. Take care, Annette""I<APO>m sorry but no one can diagnose rashes without seeing them in person. I can<APO>t even guess what is causing it. This is something you have to work out with your doctor. I don<APO>t think the prozac is in your system anymore. I do not try antidepressants anymore. I tried many of them for years and they made things worse not better. I did not try Cymbalta or Pristiq (sp?) and I don<APO>t intend to. My doctor knows this is and is okay with it. I did try another med last year that was shown in a study to help with FMS symtoms, I vomited every half hour for two days. I thought only one day had gone by. I was that out of it. My husband wanted to take me to the hospital, but I told him it was just a drug reaction and it would pass. It did. I would have felt much better, much faster, had I gone to the ER and gotten IV fluids and anti-vomiting meds. I won<APO>t take that drug again, lol. Try to stick it out with one doctor for several visits before you decide to change doctors. It takes at least three visits for both of you to get to know each other well enough to work together. That has worked for me, may or may not work for you. Take care, Annette""Hi, Gail Up near the top of your screen, your browser should have a place labeled ""Bookmarks"". When you are at the ""Chronic Pain Management: Member Discussion"" home page, click on the ""Bookmark"" place, then follow the instructions and click on ""Bookmark this page"", etc. Later when you want to come back here, you click on the ""Bookmark"" and then again on the place where it has been listed and you will come back to the message exchange home page. It used to be message board, now it is message exchange, near as I can figure out. Our new medical expert has a specific interest in RSD/CRPS si he may be of some use to you, I don<APO>t know how often he will post here, we will see. So far I am not thrilled with the new changes, but I just started too. They are not better for me as I use the board, but we will just have to get used to them and explore the various things and see where they go from here. Hang in there for awhile anyway. It will take weeks/months for all the wrinkles to be ironed out. Hugs, Annette""Gail, I told you on another post how to bookmark this exchange, but now I have discovered they have made it easier for us. Just go to the upper right hand corner area of the page and it will say ""Bookmark this page"", try clicking on that. Also click on ""join this exchange"" for this and any other exchanges (boards) you use. Then in future when you come to one exchange and want to change from one to another, you can look in the left hand column near the top and you will see ""My Exchanges"" in green, with a list of the ones you have joined in blue. Put your cursor over the blue and click and it should send you directly to that exchange (board). If I find out I am wrong, sorry, I will tell you. I hate trying to figure out all this stuff, but we have no choice so try and make the best of it for now. For posts that you make where you are hoping for an answer, go directly below this box you are typing in and click in the square next to ""Put this on my watchlist and alert me by email to new posts."" I am hoping that will be useful, but I am not sure yet. They should send an email to your inbox when anyone responds to that post. Might help, might not. Hugs, Annette""I am getting some of the email alerts on an email watch list now, but not all of the threads I had marked, as I tend to mark all of the ones that I post on. Another problem is that often the email alerts are alerting me that I replied, so I waste a lot of time going from page to page to check on the alerts. They should only alert for new replies, not the one I made myself. Take care, Annette""I do appreciate that the exchange is now printing in dark black print when we post. That makes it much easier for all of us to read. Give my thanks to the team for that. Take care, Annette""But, what I have found is that they send me alerts on posts to which no one has replied to my post. My post is the NEW post that they are alerting me to. So, it would seem to follow that they would send an alert for every post I have made and checked the box to put it on my watch list. I am pretty good about remembering to check the box for every post I make. I am not sure this is a great tool anyway because I like to read all the new posts, not just the ones I have marked for my watch list that I have already started reading. This makes another list with that much more scrolling around, then I read the whole ""discussions"" list anyway. Too much repetition for me. Too much time wasted. This may be great for folks who live their lives on the exchanges, and have nothing else to do, but not so much for those of us who want to read the new posts, reply where we can and get off line and do other things. Take care, Annette""So I have responded to a few posts now, and when I click on the heading I do find my posts are present. But on the main page where all the threads are listed, under number of replies, the number does not include my reply. When does that number change to include my reply? Take care, Annette""Caprice, The problem for me is that I did not use the old boards either, haven<APO>t for years, because WebMD made it so laborious with one of their previous ""change for the better"" soft ware upgrades, and it took so long going back and forth from page to page. I took WebMD<APO>s advice and used the email digests, now they are gone too. I am totally lost with either the old way via the ""Discussions"" link or this new way. I figured I may as well start out with the new way and see what happens. I am only attending this one board right now, I stopped going to the FMS Board and the Joint Board. I just can<APO>t stand sitting so long, it hurts too much. We will see how it goes. I<APO>ve gotten no emails alerting me for discussions on my watchlist. Take care, Annette""Hi, Greg It is Sat. afternoon. I assume we will get used to this new stuff, but so far I am not liking it. Too much going back and forth from one screen to another, and can<APO>t seem to figure out from the basic list of posts, which ones are ones I have read and which ones I have not read. At this point, I am just focusing on the posts, not the extra features that they are offering, that may or may not be of any use to me. Take care, Annette PS, I have seen Charles and Gail, but not Galib or Teresa yet.""So, I am supposed to write down the times I replied and hope that works and no one else replied around the same time, that is crazy. No one has sent me any email notifications, I try to check the Watchlist box for every post I make now, but nothing comes in my email box. I didn<APO>t use the old Discussion format as they took to long with all the back and forth from one page to another, I used the email digests. I am sorry, but WebMD has a history of not caring what its members liked or didn<APO>t like before, and changing much of anything. Last time they told me to use the email digests as a work around, now they have taken them away. Sure, we will figure it all out eventually, we have no choice, but we will probably lose some valuable members along the way. We will see. Take care, Annette PS, I know it is not your fault, and there is really nothing you can do except pass along the input to the people who really have not been responsive in the past. Makes it frustrating for us.""Another problem with the watch list alerts is that the links do not take you to the appropriate post in the thread that you are looking for replies to. Instead the link takes you to the heading, and then you have to search through all the posts to find the one that hopefully replied to your last post. For some of the older threads that have 50-70 posts in them, that also takes up time that I could better spend elsewhere. Take care, Annette""Any luck??? I guess there is no point in trying to use the ""Exchange Home"" link at the upper left, if after you read so many posts, you will have to go over to the ""Discussions"" format to read the rest of that days<APO> posts (but you have to wade through the ones you have already read also). I do not come more than once a day, so if they stop putting the new posts up after 14 hours on the ""Exchange Home"" link, there is not much point in doing it all twice. I have also found that if I check my watch list alerts first, then go back and read the rest of the new posts, it just takes that much longer to get through them all. The more time I spend going from page to page just to read stuff (instead of just scanning through my email digest, no page changes except when I want to reply) the less time I will spend actually responding to posts and getting involved in discussions. Take care, Annette""One more thing that I know WebMD can change because this is not the first time they have done this. To find out if there is more than one page of posts in a thread, one must scroll all the way down to the bottom of the page to find the page numbers to move around in the entire thread. You can put this up at the top of the page also, as you have done this before when a new change started out this way and everyone complained. It is all the page changing and scrolling that takes up so much time and drives me nuts. Take care, Annette""I tried leaving the board and coming back, to see if that would cause my replies to be tabulated into the number of replies, but it did not work. Is it safe to assume that the little box with the - / signs shows if I have read it or not? Take care, Annette PS, I do not have the time or the energy to play around with all the features, I just want to rad and answer posts as efficiently as possible. Is there a place that will just explain to us how to do that?""The little -/ sign did not change from - to after I read this post, so I assume that was a wrong guess on my part.""Sorry, I meant to type the little -/ sign did not change from - to after I read this post...""So I have been typing the little plus sign in all the appropriate places in the last to posts above, it showed up as I typed it in, however, when it posted, your software deleted the plus sign. I typed ""The little -/""plus sign"" did not change from - to ""plus sign"" after I read this post...""""Directly above this there is a large red ""Welcome to the WebMD Health Exchange"" follow the instructions below that. Take care, Annette""I figured out how to decrease the font size, press ctrl and the minus key at the same time. I still don<APO>t know how to tell by looking at the list if I have already read that post/discussion. There is no change in color, no ""new"" next to it, etc. Take care, Annette""It wasn<APO>t that hard to figure out. I guessed. Working backward from the other way to adjust it. I know I<APO>ve posted problems on more than one thread, probably because I can<APO>t figure out what is going on yet. Thanks anyway. Take care, Annette""Also, how do we decrease the font size. I figured out how to increase it, and followed the instructions to decrease it to find the size best for me, and it won<APO>t go back down. Thanks. Take care, Annette""Go see your doctor and get this evaluated. Are you talking about the area of the joint of your big toe and your foot? Take care, Annette""You could have gout, or any of a number of kinds of arthritis. Or something else entirely. You need to go see your doctor to find out what it is and what to do. Then come back with a diagnosis, and people with similar things will share what they have tried for relief. Meanwhile you can try elevating your foot higher than your heart, and putting an ice bag on your toe, with a towel between the ice bag and your skin. Do this for 20-30 minutes at a time and see if it helps. Take care, Annette""I have had good doctors all the way through this experience, about 15 years for me. Of course it takes awhile to make an accurate diagnosis, and I have multiple diagnoses, not just one. We found one thing after another. It did seem overwhelming for awhile. I was married about 20 years ago, and only had migraine headaches at that point. I now have two other chronic pain conditions, DDD, and FMS. My hubby has been great throughout this long journey. It does get better as you get better at taking care of yourself. Keep looking for a good doctor. I have all my care done by my internal medicine doctor at this point. I had specialists in the past, but not anymore. If you are in a group that says nothing ever gets better than it is now, run far, far away from that group and find one that is more positive. I gave up working as a nurse, and now I get SSDI, I thought my life was at an end, but it wasn<APO>t. Life is good. There are things that I cannot do, but there are still plenty of things that I CAN do. Take care, and please come back again. Annette""I really believe that if SOs or spouses leave, they would have left with some other stressor anyway. My hubby had cancer when I met him and was in chemo and radiation treatments. He decided to stop treatment because he was so sick all the time, they gave him six months to live at that point. He moved in with me, and after a couple of months decided he better get a job, so he did. That was over twenty years ago. We married after living together for about six months when he didn<APO>t die. I just noticed that I have had FMS for half of our life together. He loves me staying home, but also loved it when I was working. He is willing to be flexible in our lives, and he has a great sense of humor. Those are two things that I find very important in a successful relationship. You and your hubby hang in there and love each other whatever happens in your lives. Hugs, Annette""It sounds like your doctor is not treating your pain. I would suspect a problem if a patient kept coming to the ER for pain shots, 5 times in one month. It is not their job to treat chronic pain with constant injections. A pain shot typically lasts 4-6 hours. What is your doctor doing to treat your pain? I have FMS, and DDD also, and I am on SSDI, I have never been to the ER for a shot for my FMS pain, my doc and I have a treatment plan, and that is what I use. If my pain flares we have a plan for that, and if it is still too much, I go see my own doctor. Kids are versatile, I knew a single mom with MS who was basically bedridden due to her health issues. She supported her kids financially by doing book keeping at home. They loved their mom and grew up with her that way, and were fine young men. Look into SSDI right away. If you have not worked enough time in the last ten years you won<APO>t be eligible. You have to keep paying into it to get benefits. Take care, Annette""Your doctor CAN give you more powerful meds if he so chooses, and if you choose to take them. Waiting until your pain is terrible, then going to the ER for a pain shot is the worst way to treat pain. It is far better to take a stronger, long acting pain med on a set schedule so your pain is kept at lower levels all the time. Then you use the short acting Lortab as a breakthrough med as needed. It has been shown in medical studies that people who use pain meds the way you describe, actually end up taking MORE opiates than people who take them when the pain starts and use them on a regular basis to control their pain. Adding an antidepressant may help lower your pain levels also. They are commonly used in pain control, because they mediate the same neurotransmitters that carry both pain and depression messages. It is not because the doctor thinks you are crazy, or depressed. Switching from flexeril to a different muscle relaxant may help keep your pain at bay without making you sleepy. The sedating side effects of all these meds usually goes away after a few days or weeks of regular use, so it would be wise to have someone around to help watch the kids until you know what side effects you have whenever you start a new med. It is unlikely you will find a pain management doc to take care of you without insurance unless you have the hefty $$$ up front when you go to the office. Have you asked your doctor if he would be willing to continue writing your RXs if you see a PM doc as a one time consult? That is far more affordable than seeing both of them, or even just the PM doc on a regular basis. You need to use all your tools to keep pain levels down, not just the meds, but heat, ice, exercise, etc. I didn<APO>t mean not to apply for SSDI, I meant you should apply right away and not let any more time pass or you may not be eligible anymore. I think it is 10 years, but I am not sure. Go to ssa.gov and they can help you. That site is the official site for SS and is very user friendly. Take care, Annette""Sorry, but both me and my doctor felt I had auditory hallucinations, not ""strange feelings"" as a result of taking benadryl. I felt wide awake, and heard people talking in the next room when no one was there but me. Hearing voices when no one is there is a classic auditory hallucination. I have had visual hallucinations one other time as a result of a med I took. I stopped the med, and told my doctor the next time I saw her and we tried something else. That was the only time I have had a visual hallucination. Trust me, I know the difference between ""strange feelings"" and hallucinations. There is nothing in my ""Drug Information Handbook for Advanced Practice Nursing"" that says auditory hallucinations are related to the use of gabapentin, but I am certainly open to more recent information coming out as more people are taking it. The dose she was prescribed is within the normal limits for that drug for a patient in chronic pain. As an old RN, I felt a certain amount of moderation to my reaction as the husband DID write here, rather than taking his wife to the doctor or the ER. In my experience as a nurse, people who are really concerned take their loved one to the ER prior to writing on a message board and waiting patiently for a reply. It seemed to me that he had things well under control, and was asking what other people thought. I feel he can process ALL of our experiences, including mine, and decide what to do with his wife. He can certainly keep the journal for her if she is unable to keep it herself. If she is asleep all the time, how is she taking her meds on schedule? If he is helping her with that, he can help her with the journal. If she is waking up often enough to manage her own meds, she can write down a note or two about how she feels things are going. One way out-patients drugs are somewhat self-limiting, is if they are too sleepy to take them, they usually miss a dose, and take them when they wake up. I did instruct, as I always do, the husband to take his wife to the doctor or the ER if he felt it were necessary. He is an adult and I am sure he can make that decision on his own. I have had a total of 40 years of nursing experience including ICU/CCU, ER, outpatient addiction treatment, and others. But, I come here as a member of the community as we all do with all our varied experiences. Your experiences are different from mine, but just as valuable. Your opinions are different from mine on this issue, but just as valuable. I hope the poster reads everyones<APO> posts and evaluates his wife<APO>s experience and makes a decision on how to handle their situation. I feel confidant that he can do that. Take care, Annette""Hi, Cabrel I would make an appt. to see the doctor earlier than is already scheduled if you and your wife feels it is necessary. I do not try to get my doctor on the phone, I make an appt. to go see her. I get privacy, and one on one attention, she gets paid for her time. Seems fair to me. I don<APO>t believe in discussing important things with the doctor on the phone for many reasons, the primary one being you won<APO>t get the same quality of medical care on the phone as you will in person. This is something my doctor and I agree on so it works well for us. In the ten years I have been seeing her, I have called her on the phone one time (that was at her request), to check on me as I adjusted a new medication. Sometimes it means making more frequent appts. while adjusting meds or trying new treatments, but I feel that is worthwhile. For a doctor to speak to you on the phone, he must be told you have called, then he tells someone to pull your wife<APO>s records, he reads them briefly to refresh his memory (he probably has several hundred patients), then he finds the time between other patients<APO> appts. to call you. He feels rushed and pressured to keep his patient schedule going so he does not hold up the patients in the waiting room. The result is your wife does not get the same quality care as she would sitting across the room from him with the door closed, and her chart on the desk in front of him. Just my opinion. I take a note pad with me to my appts. and write down any changes in medication dosages, treatments, referals, etc. that she suggests. It is far too easy to forget exactly what was said a few days later. I have had only one doctor in my whole life that wrote down exactly what he wanted you to do, and handed you a copy as you left the room, and also put a copy in your chart. I wish ALL doctors would do that, it would eliminate a whole lot of confusion and med errors. There is never any excuse for a member of the doctor<APO>s office staff to be rude to a patient or her family. The office manager cannot obtain the old records without your wife<APO>s written request. I believe she was referring to a written ""release of inormation"" form that the patient must sign herself, and send to the office that is sending her old records to a new doctor. They cannot send her records on your say so, or on the request of the new doctor without this form. If you have a fax machine at home, they can fax you the form. They are not even supposed to discuss her medical business with you unless she has signed a form giving them permission to do so. This is a federal law. I am glad your wife is feeling better. If she cuts back on the caffeine, the twitches may lessen, or they may not. But that is likely to be one of the first things they suggest for her to do. I have migraines and caffeine has never been a trigger for me, but every medical person I ever spoke to about the migraines told me to eliminate caffeine from my diet. I finally did for other reasons, but no change in my migraines, lol. According to my drug handbook twitching happens in less than 1% of people taking gabapentin. My experience with gabapentin and other drugs is that often side effects go away with a few weeks on the drug. I felt really drunk when I first started using gabapentin, and whenever I increased the dose significantly. That feeling went away after 2-3 weeks ont he drug. I now have no side effects at all. Please go with her to the doctor at her scheduled appt. or at a sooner one, and take notes. The doctor is the best person to allay your fears and adjust things for your wife. Take care, Annette""Do you really believe that ""some doctors would rather give you a lethal combo"" than give you narcotics? Wouldn<APO>t they run out of paying customers that way? The neurontin and the antidepressant she was given are both part of a normal cocktail of drugs that pain management doctors use. No drug is right for all people, you can<APO>t take the neurontin successfully. I can<APO>t take antidepressants successfully. I lost huge hunks of recent memory when I was on antidepressants at low to normal doses. But, that does not mean other people cannot use those drugs successfully. My husband used Celexa succeffully for his chronic pain for a couple of years. Just taking more opioids is not always the answer to chronic pain. Too many people would end up on very high opioid doses and it may end up very difficult for them to find doctors willing to treat them. I will probably be on opioids of some sort for the rest of my life. I want to keep my opioid doses as low as possible for as long as possible. I am happy to use other drugs and other treatment methods in conjunction with the opioids so I can delay increasing those doses for as long as possible. The poster said his wife<APO>s pain was better, he was concerned about the sedation. Using BT meds twice a day is a reasonable approach as long as the long acting meds cover most of her pain. Different doctors handle this differently. The patient<APO>s husband stated she was sleeping 12 hours a day. I took that to mean she was awake 12 hours a day. I have no doubt that as she becomes used to the drug changes, she will sleep less. I feel this is something to discuss with her own doctor. If she has been in severe pain prior to these med changes, I bet she lost a lot of sleep due to pain, and in part may be catching up on it. He is describing things as getting better, I believe him. Take care, Annette""Greg, The doctor did adjust the fentanyl patch application from q 72 hours to q 48 hours. The neurontin he prescribed was certainly within the normal range of doses for chronic pain. My drug book says as much as 49 grams have been taken in overdoses, and the patients survived with supportive care. They were awake with slurred speech, lethargy, etc. 300 to 1800 mg. a day are quoted as the most common dose range in chronic pain. Up to 2400 mg. a day has been tolerated in long term studies, and up to 3600 mg. a day in shorter term studies. This is a common drug in pain management, and using it in conjunction with opiates is common practice. I have taken it for nearly ten years and it has lowered my pain levels and allowed me to take less opioids daily. That is one of my personal goals. I do not want to end up on very high doses of opioids and find no doctors willing to treat me. A number of doctors have told me that it is a relatively clean drug. It has a relatively short half life about 5-7 hours, your body can clean it out of your system fairly quickly. Just my opinion, we all have one. Take care, Annette""This is one of those instances where the written word is perceived differently than it would have been if people were sitting face to face. It was not harsh in my estimation. I personally feel the husband was well in control of the situation, he is seeing his wife face to face, unlike the rest of us. He has made the decision not to take her immediately to the ER, so I think things are not as bad as some people here took them. I happen to agree with HIM, I think she is having some transitory side effects that will work out in time. I was not in agreement with some folks that felt this was more of an emergency than it seemed to me by reading his posts. Again, we are only reading his posts, we cannot see his wife, and make any kind of assessment, which is why I suggested if they were concerned enough to feel a need to see the doctor that they do so. This is a message board, not a 911 center. People get answers to their questions whenever anyone gets around to posting. No one in their right mind who thought their loved one was in danger would post here rather than go to their doctor or the ER. If they would, then they need to read this post, and call 911 first. I feel that a lot of information that we post here is not just for the person who started the thread, but for many people who may find themselves in similar situations and can benefit from any information they may find while lurking here. Anyone who does not want to read particular posts is free to skip any of the posts. I apologize to anyone whose feelings I hurt. Take care, Annette""Lots of discussions get off track from the initial post. Different people post different things and someone may decide to discuss something in a new post under an old thread. I don<APO>t have a problem with that. I feel in this case the ""books and dosage scales"" ARE important. People mentioned that they thought the dose was off and that she may be overdosing, that this was not even the correct drug to be using for chronic pain, etc. I took the time to look up the proper dosing for chronic pain and the percentage of people with specific side effects in a proper reference book. I feel that knowing the doctor was prescribing in the normal range of use for that medical problem would be reassuring. It does not mean that is the correct dose for that patient, that is up to the husband and the wife and the doctor to discuss personally and make whatever adjustment is necessary. The doctor can SEE the patient, and has access to much more information than we do. He also has the medical license. You say we need to ""always look at the patient"", of course this is true. However, we cannot see the patient, nor is she our patient. We are not even communicating with the patient, we are in communication with the husband of the patient. I feel when dealing with message boards, we need to have a bit more confidence in the patient and her husband communicating with HER doctor. Perhaps helping her to do that more effectively is the best thing we can do without ever even meeting her. We all share our own experiences, you made a point of saying you are an ICU nurse, that may make some folks think you are in some way more authoritative than someone else. I do not know if that is your intent or not. Is that not a part of your life experiences? WebMD has a specific place on their site where people do share their experiences with all kinds of different drugs, so apparently they do feel that kind of sharing is appropriate. Go to the different exchanges here, many posts are made up of folks telling each other how they reacted to specific drugs, good and bad. If you don<APO>t wish to share your own experiences with drugs and side effects, that is your choice. You and I do not get to decide when to ""have her checked out"" by a medical professional. That is properly up to the patient. I have every confidence that Cabriel<APO>s wife can make the appropriate decisions in her case. Take care, Annette""If the only issue here is Cabriel<APO>s wife, why are you bringing up your B/P, meds, and symptoms? You see, every thread pulls into it different people with different concerns/thoughts. If you go back and reread my posts, I also advised Cabriel to call her doctor or take her to the ER if/when he thought it was appropriate. Why are you thinking that we disagree on this? Take care, Annette""My ""Drug Information Handbook for Advanced Practice Nursing"" is the book I use for looking up drugs as a first line block of information. Often I can feel if it has the info I need very quickly, if not then I look up other sites to find more info. I feel very comfortable using the info they give me. I know once I call a drug company, I introduce myself as a nurse say and have a question about one of the drugs they make. I ask to speak to a pharmacist or a doctor please. They divulge all the important info about a specific drug when I ask them nicely, they have always answered all my questions nicely""I haven<APO>t heard of any new, terrible side effects with gabapentin. I<APO>ve been on it for around 10 years. I had the transitory sedation, at first for several weeks, but the pain was better. Then the sedation wore off. I then felt my normal self and didn<APO>t hurt as much. You are right about drug companies, you have to search out foreign studies often time and study them to get the most balanced ones or go to a peer reviewed medical journal. They maintain certain levels and rules about how the tests can be done. Take care, Annette""I think it is a good idea to keep a medication record until she has been on a set schedule for quite awhile. This way you can see when she is taking the percocet as well as the other meds, and she and her doctor will also be able to see that she is taking her meds properly and how they are working. Percocet is generally ordered every six hours as needed, but I have also seen it ordered every four hours as needed for pain occasionally. Look on the label to check to see how her doctor ordered it, that is how she should take it. My concern is that she says she waits until the pain is really bad, then takes it. It is my experience that if you take the pain med as soon as the pain level increases patients end up taking less medicine in the long run as the drug works better when pain first starts to flare up, than it does when pain is totally out of control. As far as the neurontin (gabapentin) goes, I have used this nerve medicine for about 10 years. When I started it, my doctor started me at 300 mg. a day, then increased it by 300 mg. more a day, once a week, until I felt I had good results. I went up to 1800 mg. a day and stayed there for a few months. Then I told me doc I felt a bit too lethargic during the day and she had me adjust it down to what I felt was a good dose for me. So, now I take 800 mg. a day. I have always taken it once a day, 5-6 hours before bedtime. This helps me get a good night<APO>s sleep and be more awake during the day. It does come in smaller doses, so if the doctor felt it was wise, she could increase it more slowly. I think it is good that the doctor is going to see her again soon to evaluate her progress. I feel it is very smart to invest in appts. closer together when you are adjusting meds until you get it right. I kept a pain journal for my doc at the beginning and still do when we make med changes. I score the pain on the 0-10 scale at the time I take meds and about two hours later, in addition to when I wake up, and go to bed. This gives us a good idea of how my pain is doing throughout the day. I also keep track of my general activity level, as my doc and I feel that is a good measure of how well my pain is controlled. Increased function is a sign of good pain control. If she find the two Percocet a day are not enough, and she feels she needs three a day, or four a day, she needs to discuss this with her doctor before she increases the number of doses she takes. I know it is hard to not just take another one, and worry about running out later, but that is a bad idea. She needs to develop trust with her doctor and he won<APO>t trust her if she runs out of Percocet early. By documenting each dose she takes along with a pain score on a medicine chart it will make it easier for the doctor to see how she is doing. If her pain scores is constantly up at the 8-9 level, he will know things need to be changed. I agree with the doctor that the twitching as she falls asleep is probably nocturnal myoclonus rather than real seizures. With tonic/myoclonic seizures (gran mal seizures with jerking of the limbs) one usually has a period of unconsciousness afterward that gradually goes away. You would be unable to awaken her, and then she would gradually come to, being confused at first, she may or may not have memory loss. If you are seeing this twitching at any other time during the day or if you are concerned about it, you might ask him about it again, and ask if he feels an EEG is needed. That is a non-invasive test that records the brain waves. It would show any seizure activity. She is lucky to have you to support her at this difficult time. Take care, Annette""I am one of those people who like to make only one med change at a time so I know what is causing what. However, I know many people who don<APO>t want to wait and possibly be in pain that long and want to just get on with it. Both ways have their pluses and minuses. He really just adjusted the doses on her opiates, and neurontin, and added the Celexa. The changes and additions her doctor is making is not that big a deal. Sedation can be a side effect of both the opiates and the neurontin. Celexa can go either way, it kept my hubby awake and we had to adjust the time he took it. I take neurontin and have for about ten years now. I went up to 1800 mg. a day, then gradually lowered it to 800 mg. a day once my pain was controlled. When I started it and made the increases in dose, I would feel really drunk an hour or so after the dose. That went away fairly quickly. My doctor routinely gives as much as 3600 mg. per day. I opt to take all of mine at bedtime so I sleep through my night better and am awake more in my daytime. I am an old night nurse, and my day and night have permanently changed a bit from the rest of the world<APO>s. My doctor told me many of her patients opt to take it this way to avoid the daytime sleepiness. I have restless leg syndrome and have been known to kick my feet enough at night to wear holes in the bottom sheet (literally). I began ambien to help with this problem, I slept through it, but my hubby said I was still kicking a lot. When I began the neurontin at bedtime, I stopped kicking altogether. Many meds cause vivid dreams that feel like hallucinations to me. Benadryl was one that I really noticed. I dreamed that there were people in the next room and my hubby wasn<APO>t there, and I could not get up and tell these people to leave. It was very scary. I told my doctor about it, and he told me not to take benadryl anymore. I stopped using it, and had no more dreams like that. FMS causes one to wake up feeling as if they did not get proper rest, no matter how long one sleeps. It is called non-restorative sleep. I have not felt rested on waking up in well over ten years. I would suggest she keep a medicine/pain/sleep/side effect journal to take with her to the doctor in one month for her appt. This will help the doctor in doing any other adjustments to her meds/treatment plan. That is far more accurate than trying to remember in the doctor<APO>s office how you felt three weeks ago. Meanwhile, if any of these things worry you, I would call and make an appt. to see the doctor to discuss them. I would NOT play phone tag with the doctor, giving your message to the nurse/med.asst., to give to the doctor, then he tells her what to tell you. Too many ways to get the whole thing messed up. If you are there face to face with your list of concerns to discuss, and he has your wife and the chart right in front of him, things will go better. Of course, if anything seems seriously wrong, call 911 or take her to the ER. Take care, Annette""I would avoid high impact exercises for now, and stick to walking and/or a water exercise program, if your doctor okays it. Go back to the doctor and tell him you are still in pain. Write down your questions and DO NOT get up to leave until he has addressed all your concerns. I am not sure what info an MRI would give to help you at this point. Describing the accident to the doctor is the most important thing so he can picture in his mind just how your body moved and what might have happened in the accident. It has only been one month, and muscle strains/sprains of the muscles, and soft tissue of the back can take awhile to heal. When you see the doctor ask him how long it should take for you to start to heal. He can<APO>t give you an exact date, but he should be able to tell you a general time frame so you don<APO>t worry about it. If your doctor does not seem to be addressing your concerns, ask him for a referral to an orthopedic doctor who deals with spinal injuries. If you don<APO>t need a referral for your insurance, you can find one yourself. Take care, Annette""What kind of imaging they order depends on what happened in the accident and where and what kind of pain you have. They do not do scans on everyone who is in a car accident. The xray of the neck/back IS important because it will show if/where the vertebrae are broken. I have seen people who were in an accident, and got up and walked around and refused the xray to clear the spine, and transected their spinal cord later and ended up in a wheelchair for good. You can also fracture a vertebrae and not have serious consequences, other than a lot of pain. It depends on what part of the vertebrae you fracture. MRIs and CT scans are done for specific symptoms and injuries. Take care, Annette""There are a whole battery of tests to do to rule out a variety of illnesses, from vitamin deficiencies, to lupus to thyroid problems. You need to see your pcp and get a thorough examination and whatever tests your doctor feels appropriate. Take care, Annette""FMS is a chronic illness that usually does not ever go away completely. It is an illness that can usually be managed with meds and a variety of non-drug treatments. It may take awhile to find the right combination of treatments. Keep at it with your doctor until you find the combo that works best for you. Even after that, you may have to occasionally tweak your treatment plan for the best effect. Take care, Annette""I also have FMS, laying in bed all day is the worst thing you can do. You need to be up and moving about. I use the 30/30 rule, other people use a 15/15 rule. I am active for 30 minutes, then I rest for 30 minutes. You have to find the best limit for you. Depression does cause pain and fatigue, as does FMS, people can have both and if they do, both require treatment if you are going to get better. Many people react to a newly diagnosed chronic illness with depression, but just as many do not. It is worth exploring anyway. Opiate pain meds should be given only when the other treatments for FMS do not work. Opiates do not work for all folks with FMS, the latest studies show that they often do not work at all for FMS pain. I still feel they are worth trying if other treatments don<APO>t work. It does take a long time rotating various meds to find the treatment plan that works best for you. Take care, Annette""The study was explained in an article here on WebMD. They found that opiates did not relieve the pain of FMS effectively. It was not about people having too many side effects and stopping the meds due to the side effects, the drug simply did not relieve the pain. This made the FMS news for awhile on many sites where FMS is discussed. I personally prefer the research that is discussed on http://www.myalgia.com regarding FMS. I trust Dr. Robert Bennett, MD, and his FMS research/treatment group at OHSU in Portland, OR. I feel they are closer to dealing effectively with FMS on many different levels. I feel that certain subsets of folks wtih FMS do respond favorably to opiate therapy along with other treatments in controlling their FMS symptoms. I don<APO>t think that opiates alone will totally relieve FMS pain. As a nurse, I also know for a fact that opiates are not always the answer for all kinds of pain. For whatever reason, some people are not helped by opiates no matter how high the dose is taken. It may be their own genetics at play, or it may be the etiology of their pain. Take care, Annette""Why don<APO>t you just post a link to the article, then we can all read it for ourselves. Take care, Annette""Over a year to get in to a pain clinic? Yikes, that is bad. Are there any other doctors around that can manage your pain for you? I would suggest you get a second MRI immediately just to document any changes that might be due to the accident. I was rear ended years ago and did not get one right away. The insurance company for the lady who hit me, said my MRI changes could have taken place any time after the accident and not be a result of the accident at all. You may not have any changes, you may have changes, but at least they will be documented. it has already been several months. I hope you feel better soon. Take care, Annette""Anyone with 3 kids, that works full time and goes to school full time is going to be lacking in time left to play with her kids. There are only so many hours in a day. I always said God should have made days with 30 hours in each one. Then I would have finished everything I needed to. Back pain does not always show up on imaging studies with a specific cause. I would find a doc that you feel comfortable with and stick to him, and avoid the ER as much as possible. You might try cognitive behavioral therapy and see if that helps you cope with your chronic illness. It may never go away, but it should be managable. Take care, Annette""It is a way of learning to frame your thoughts in such a way as to avoid the really negative things that many of us end up with that only increases our pain, anxiety and depression. For instance if I am having more pain than usual (yesterday and today it has been really bad) I have a choice of how to think about that. I can tell myself that my pain is out of control and will never be taken care of properly because doctors are afraid of the DEA, etc. I can justify staying in bed all day, which never helps. Or I can think more rationally, I know I have had pain this bad before, and between my hot tub and my meds and my stretching exercises, it usually does not last longer than a couple of days. (It has been two days, and I can tell it is getting better as I expected it to.) The first way of thinking is called catastrophic thinking, and leads to more worry and stress, and more pain. The second way of thinking works for me, I find it more calming and the pain is more easily managed. This is just a small example of how CBT works. It takes a certain amount of self discipline at first, to recognize and alter your thinking patterns, but after awhile it just happens and things gt better. My old therapist gave me a book about CBT called ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns, MD as a going away gift. It is great, a good read and very helpful. I just picked out the parts that I thought would be helpful for me, but I bet it is better to do the whole program. It is available at all the big chain bookstores in softback. You could probably get it on line also. Take care, Annette""I would get a second opinion from another doctor who puts in the SCS and also does the nerve ablation. Ask him which he would recommend first, and which is more invasive. I would personally think that the SCS is more invasive, simply because it requires surgery to put in and out, and also to correct the lead placement which seems to be pretty common. It may be a matter of semantics as to which is more invasive, he seems to think the ablation is more permanent, so that may be why he considers it more invasive??? My only concern is that your present doctor seems to only be pushing the procedure that he actually does himself. There would seem to me to be a financial incentive for him to convince you to go his way. Studies have shown that doctors who have a financial incentive for a particular treatment, do recommend it more often than one that someone else get the $$$ for. You know him, would that matter to him? Take care, Annette""Perhaps your pcp will write your pain med RXs once the PM doctor dismisses you because you won<APO>t do anymore procedures/injections.My pcp takes care of me, and I have the rare one time consult appt. with a PM doctor just to make sure he agrees with the treatment plan I am on. I just had one a few months ago, and he was happy with what we were doing. I am lucky no one has suggested injections to me in many years. Take care, Annette""My husband had multiple Staph infections in a wound on his lower leg that would not heal. I strongly recommend seeing a infectious disease doctor to resolve this. He did and he required vascular surgery on that leg to fix it. The ID doctor sent him to the top vascular doc in our area. He also put one of those Groshong cathers in his chest and gave him IV antibiotics for six weeks in case it was in his bone. It took us nearly two years of wound care, and doctors<APO> appts. to get this resolved. But it was when he finally saw the ID doctor that things started getting better. When he had been infection free for four months the orthopedic doctor scheduled the hip replacement surgery. He had that done at age 64. He got off of the methadone he was taking within about 6 weeks of the surgery. It got rid of 90% of his pain. He takes an occasional Endocet for residual pain. Even if that can<APO>t be done for you, you should exhaust all the options before giving up. We were at the point where my husband was okay with just staying on the methadone for the rest of his life, when the ID doctor came into our lives. What an angel, lol. His pcp was more than willing to continue him on opiates for life if necessary to have a life. He used a 5 iron for a cane, what a great conversation starter. Just do whatever you have to do. Take care, Annette""I assume your sister is an adult?? I would try and contact her regular pcp or her neurologist that manages her headaches. Perhaps they will be more available than the one who did her block. Depending on the ER personnel, they may think she is a drug seeker, some of them are just that way unfortunately. She may be speaking from experience. Meanwhile, you can help her by providing a dark, quiet place for her to rest. I found ice packs on the side of my head that hurt was very helpful. Provide something to drink constantly as if she becomes dehydrated, the headache will get worse. Make sure her meds are at her bedside. I can remember headaches so bad that I did not want to move to go get my meds. Only she can decide when it is bad enough to go to the ER, I certainly feel it is reasonable to give in and go if I start vomiting or simply cannot get enough fluids down. Other than that, I would stay in bed and stay very still, as moving at all made it worse. It is often harder for the loved ones than for the patient. Take care, Annette""The problem is that it is very hard to find an orthopedic doctor who will see you without you paying for the visit with cash up front, and the ER will send you a bill later. Lack of health insurance can prevent people from getting care in the US. Anon<UD>5978 might be able to get specialist care or an MRI by seeing a doc at a free clinic, then getting a referral to a specialist/MRI provider, and waiting until there is a free appt. available. Only some counties in some states have these kinds of free specialist appts. available. The free clinic is usually the gatekeeper for other free or discounted services. Call Salvation Army, Catholic Charities, etc. to find the free clinics in your area. You can also try a Google search for free clinics in your area. Take care, Annette""You should ask your doctor about medicine since he has a doctor actively involved in his care. Since the pain is pretty much on a set schedule, you might ask your son<APO>s doctor about giving him whatever analgesic he suggests on a set schedule about an hour prior to when it usually starts, this might prevent or decrease the amount of pain he has. Does he limp all the time or only when it hurts? When we had growing pains as children my mom would give us a hot bath, and rub our legs as she told us a story. That would make us fall asleep without fail. I did the same with my son. This is labor intensive for the parents, but seems to work. If you have already done that, I have no other suggestions. Take care, Annette""If he gets relief with Panadol or Tempra, there is no point in giving him stronger pain meds. The fact that those meds work for his pain is a really good sign to me. How soon after he takes the medicine does he feel better? Ask him if he hurts when he limps during the day. If not, you might matter of factly remind him to walk as properly as he can when you notice him limping. Are you responding to him limping? If yes, how are you responding? I would react to his complaints of pain at the 5-6 pm time by handing him his meds, and a glass of water and telling him to rest quietly in bed with no TV, video games, etc. for at least an hour or until the medicine works. It should take at least a half an hour for it to work. By making this a time when he really gets no attention at all, and it is not fun time, you may be able to sort out how much of this is attention-getting behaviour and how much is not. Kids at that age often are unable to tell us exactly what is bothering them and why, they often have real, physical complaints when they are having emotional issues. He may not know himself if he is seeking attention. My niece used to complain of stomach aches all the time at that age. Once the doctor ruled out anything serious, I would respond to her complaints by putting her to bed in my room every time she complained of one for some quiet, resting time. (She spent every afternoon after school at my house until her parents got home from work for a year.) She soon stopped complaining at all of stomach aches at my house and played happily with my son. I am not saying your son is seeking attention, I am just suggesting one way of dealing with his pain to see for certain what is going on. For the 2-3 am pain, you have to be able to judge his level of maturity and this is something you and his doctor might discuss. If he is able to handle the responsibility, you could place one dose of medicine and a bottle of water on his nightstand and instruct him to take it if he wakes up at night in pain. This gives him some control over his pain and the ability to do something about it himself. If you don<APO>t feel he can handle that or you have smaller kids who might take the medicine and eat it themselves, then you need to ask him to wake you up so you can get it for him. Hang in there, this will pass. Then you will get to deal with him being a teenager, lol. Take care, Annette""I wouldn<APO>t do any kind of rub with alcohol. They used to do that for fevers in children also, but stopped. They found that kids inhaled the fumes from the alcohol and that was bad for them. My nephew was born with congenital hip and knee problems he had surgery shortly after birth and again on one hip when he was about eight years old. He had what they called growing pains also, his mom just did the hot bath and massage thing that my mom did, along with some ibuprofen as directed by the doctor. Take care, Annette""I am so sorry that you find yourself back here after all this time. I would be glad that the tests the doctor has had done were all negative. Has he seen a podiatrist regarding this pain? They are the experts in foot problems and if your doctor thinks his pain may be related to a flat foot, a podiatrist may be able to help you sort it out. How many hours of the day does he wear the special shoes? At our house we take our shoes off indoors, so we are barefooted or in socks for much of the day. I had to wear special shoes when I was little, and I wore them 24/7 except for bathing. It was tough for my mom to get me to go to bed bare footed once we were done with the braces, etc. She took me from the special shoes in bed at night, to slippers, to socks, to bare feet. She told me it took nearly a year. I would discuss your concerns about long term medication use with your son<APO>s doctor. He can do regular blood tests that would show any problems with his kidney and liver function. Those are the organs usually affected by long term drug use. The only other thing I could suggest is to rotate the acetaminophen and the ibuprofen if the doctor says it is okay. I have to say that the medicine does not take affect in 5-10 minutes, at that point it is still in his stomach. So if he feels better that quickly after taking it, I am not certain it is the medicine actually making him feel better. Acetaminophen has an onset of action of just under an hour, and ibuprofen has an onset of action of 30-60 minutes. I looked them up in my drug handbook to be certain. I don<APO>t deal with kid<APO>s medicines, but I do know that the ones you are giving him contain one of those medicines. How is his limping? Is he doing it all the time, or just during these attacks of pain? Has the timing or the quality of the pain changed since you were last here? I wish I had something solid to offer you. Take care, Annette""Five months ago when you posted, you said he was limping most of the time, so maybe he is limping less now? Even if you only gave him the medicine twice a day, he would get 8-10 hours relief per dose, that is pretty good. Most kids<APO> forms of acetaminophen only last about 4 hours, I think. (I apologize on not being as up on kids<APO> meds as I am on adult meds.) It is great that he is getting relief that fast after taking meds, but maybe it is just the fact that he is taking something that makes him feel better. They say the placebo effect works on about 30% of patients, it is a REAL phenomenon, not just hocus-pocus. The mind - body connection is so strong that if we believe something will work, it often does. I would double check him for the flat foot with a second doctor, perhaps the one you are seeing now, or a podiatrist. I don<APO>t think going barefoot is really good for folks with flat feet, I think I have read that they need an artificial arch support if they do not have one of their own. He could have indoor and outdoor shoes to avoid tracking dirt in the house and to avoid going barefoot in the house. The pediatric ortho doctor may be absolutely correct, it could all be due to growing pains. I have four siblings, and we ALL had ""growing pains"", the doctors did not have a name or a cause for them, Mom did what she thought she should do and we did all grow out of them. He has had tests for all the BAD things that can cause pain in a child<APO>s legs, and they were negative. That is a GOOD thing. Please keep me up to date on whatever you find out. Take care, Annette""I have FMS, and avoid alcohol because it is best to avoid it while on my meds. I, like you, rarely drink anyway. However, I have never had the reaction you describe. I can have a drink or two, and do not have any effect the following day when I wake up. I think I have had two drinks in the last 6-7 years. I have to say the same thing to you that I would say to myself, ""If it hurts, don<APO>t do it."" Have a soda or juice instead of a beer. All bars that serve alcohol also serve non-alcoholic beverages. I have done extensive reading on FMS, and although I have read that alcohol should be avoided, it has always been due to the meds one was taking. If your doctor is correct, or even if it just affects you that way, just don<APO>t drink alcohol. Take care, Annette""It seems like you have experimented enough to know how you will react if you drink. It seems like now you have a choice to make. Take care, Annette""I went to the site you posted and discovered that it was put up by a private citizen with college work in English, and her own personal research over two years on FMS and CMP. Although she has a personal interest in FMS, as do you and I, I found her list of symptoms to be a list of all kinds of things all kinds of people complain about, not a list of specific FMS symptoms that have been determined by any kind of medical research. She also states that she got well. I tend to believe evidence based medical research as opposed to what someone said worked for them. Especially, if it has not been replicated in any medical studies at all. I didn<APO>t say that narcotics weren<APO>t effective in many patients with FMS. I said that one study showed that. I don<APO>t know why some research has shown that narcotics don<APO>t work for FMS pain well. I don<APO>t think that research has yet been done to figure out why on a cellular level they don<APO>t seem to work. I have only read the one study stating they don<APO>t work for FMS pain. I have read other medical articles by doctors in FMS research that states they do work for some FMS patients and should be tried if nothing else works. I agree with that. In my case, they certainly do work, but in conjunction with other treatments including non-narcotic meds and non-drug treatments like exercize and heat. I don<APO>t think there is any one cure for FMS, I think it is a chronic condition that can be managed pretty well in most patients. Narcotics are not the only, or the first choice, for neurological pain, but they are often used in conjunction with antiseizure meds for neurolgical pain. FMS is one of the things I would rather have than many of the other neuropathies, like from diabetes as you mentioned, or TMJ, RSD/CRPS, postherpetic neuralgia, etc. They are difficult to treat as I am sure you know. I do not think that FMS and chronic myofacial pain syndrome and CFIDS are all the same thing. They may be related to each other, but I feel they have been shown to have different symptoms and signs. Part of the diagnostic criteria for CFIDS is a fever, but not for FMS for instance. I feel FMS is a non-infectious neurological problem at this point in time. Perhaps with more research I will change my mind. We will see. I am always open to new stuff. Take care, Annette""You said you took ""an extra pain pill"", that doesn<APO>t mean you will run out early, just that you will be one pill short. So the last day before you fill your next RX you take one less pill. That is not enough to put you into withdrawals, but you may have more pain that day. I would have reported this incident to the employer, even if I did not plan on going to the doctor about it, just so it is documented. Of course, it is your choice, and you are aware of the possible repercussions. Same thing with your doctor, if you don<APO>t feel comfortable telling him about taking the extra pill, or you feel he may cut you off if you do, then don<APO>t tell him. You might ask him how you should handle that kind of situation if it come up, just so you know next time what to do. I always call my doctor before altering my meds at all. That is our arrangement. But she also gives me breakthrough meds in an adequate amount for my ups and downs. I think no matter what you do with your boss, I would always be honest with my doc. She<APO>s the best and I would not want to lose her. Take care, Annette""I am sorry. Our name is printed below our post, so perhaps if we ignore the ""Replies"" altogether we can see that the last post up is our own? It is far too confusing for me right now. I am signing off for now. Any help would be positive. Thanks for darkening the print from light gray to black anyway. Hugs, Annette""Thanks for your help. It is the discussions for which there are more than one ""replies"" that this becomes a problem. Hugs, Annette""What ""broadcast message"" at the top of the exchange are you talking about? I don<APO>t see anything like that. Hugs, Annette""Frankly, I rarely bother to read all the stuff on the page other than the posts, and links on the left to the various exchanges, and the watchlist. I did the first day or so, particularly the links to articles that were interesting. Will WebMD announce any changes or is it up to us to look around periodically and see if any changes have been made? Hugs, Annette""I don<APO>t know if this is being addressed or not. I posted on this exchange and left for other exchanges, and came back 45 min. later. I had posted on a thread labeled ""Growing pains..."" on this initial visit. On my next visit 45 min. later, that post of mine was at the top of the list of threads under ""What<APO>s Happening Now"", and it said it had one reply. So I followed the link and discovered there were NO replies after my post, either to me or the original poster. I assume now the ""reply"" was my reply to the original post. Checking the time doesn<APO>t work as another post of mine had already been replied to almost immediately after I posted. There is no way to tell who posted the last post. (Other message boards do have this feature, so I know it is possible) This is one of the things that could drive me away. There is no way to see if any posts are new posts, or if our posts have indeed been replied to. Take care, Annette""Thanks, Caprice Hugs, Annette""The thread titled ""Discogram..."" comes up on my watchlist email alert every day as having four new replies, but when I check my watchlist discussions on the left hand rail, and click on ""See All"" it says that there has been no activity for 6 days. What<APO>s up? The email alerts also do not include all the threads I have checked the box for. How often do the email alerts come out, I have figured it is daily, but is there a specific time they go out? A specific time that they include posts from? Also on the ""My Discussions Watchlist"" along the left rail, when you click on it, it lists all the things I have ever checked and when it last had any activity. But, when I click on ""Edit"", the list has no indication of when there was last any activity, that makes it very difficult to edit, without going back and forth to check on activity. Will they self delete after a certain length of time without activity, or do I have to do it myself? Last thing of all. Our expert on this exchange has never posted that I am aware of to offer any information or replies to any posts. Do these people get paid money to be the expert? Is there a minimum amount of time per week that they are to spend here? Take care, Annette""Usually a chest xray that is positive for TB is followed up with sputum specimens that are checked for TB also. Discuss all your symptoms with your doctor and see what he thinks. I believe that being tested for things that you really worry about is worthwhile, even if they come back negative. Then you know what is what and can focus on getting better. Take care, Annette""If you go and have a second negative skin test and negative sputum tests, I would not be so worried about TB, The way my doctor explained it to me was that if you are immune system deficient your skin test may be negative for quite awhile, because it is a sign that your immune system recognizes the TB and responds to it. He told me that if I had a negative skin test the first time, I could still have TB, that was why they did a second skin test 6 weeks after the first negative one. He told me if that one was negative, they would do a chest xray and if that was negative, they would move on and look for other reasons for my symptoms. You might see a lung specialist to recheck your xray and see if it could be something other than TB. Take care, Annette""Please post and let me know on Tuesday what the results show. Are you in the military? Take care, Annette""I had pretty much the same experience. The main difference is that I take all my neurontin once a day a few hours before bedtime. I started on 300 mg. once a day, at bedtime. I then increased it by 300 mg. once a week until I got decent relief. I went up to 1800 mg. per day at bedtime. I then moved it up a few hours so I wouldn<APO>t be as lethargic during the day. Each time I increased the dose I felt pretty drunk for a few hours after taking it. But I probably slept through most of the side effects. After I had been on 1800 mg. a day for several months, I discussed it with my doc and decreased it by 300 mg. once a week until I got down to 900 mg. That seemed to be the best dose for me. After a few months, I changed it to 800 mg. per day as that dose was available in one pill rather than taking three 300 mg. pills. I have no side effects at all that I am aware of. I sleep better, the RLS is better, and my pain levels are lower than they were when I wasn<APO>t on neurontin at all. It was worth waiting out the side effects to get the positive effects. Many drugs are like that with side effects like nausea or sedation. They do seem to wear off after awhile. Take care, Annette""Gail has lots of good suggestions as usual. I would add that I do much better when I am doing some volunteer work. It helps in the extreme sense that I am always glad to know someone is worse off than I am, sad but true. It also boosts my self esteem when I help others, even if it is something that seems minor to me, it may be a big deal to those I help. Many communities have a number you can call where someone has a list of all the volunteer work available in your community. It makes it easier to match your skills or interests up with projects that may need your help. Mine has everything from one time opportunities, to regular weekly commitments. There is something to suit every one. Take care, Annette""Just keep following the doctor<APO>s advice. I would keep a headahce journal, write down your meds and the time you take them, and when headaches start and go away. Write down any other symptoms you get also. Sometimes it takes months of trying different meds until one finds the right combination. I understand the frustration one can feel as med after med does not work well, and you have to try different ones. I went through that with my migraines also. When you finally find the right combo, it will all seem worthwhile. My doctors used single drug therapy at first, then offerred two dugs at a time for preventative and whatever rescue drugs I found that worked also. Do your own research if you can. I found my treatments on Medscape and brought my doctor the studies and asked for RXs if he thought it was worthwhile. As long as I brought evidence based medical studies and stayed away from anecdotal stuff, he was glad to try the stuff I brought him. When I chose doctors one of things I told him I needed was a doctor who would welcome evidence based studies and would at least consider them. Some doctors do not want any on line info from thei patients, and some welcome anything their patients bring in. Take care, Annette""I am afraid that this is one of those things that needs to be evaluated by your doctor. If you have a pcp, that would be the first place to stop, if you have insurance that does not require referrals then I would look for an orthopedic doctor that specializes in hands, ask before you make an appt. Carpal tunnel is one thing that is more prevalent among obese patients, because the fat crowds the tendons in the wrist going through the carpal tunnel area and that causes additional pain. However, it does not necessarily follow that because you are fat, you will have hand/wrist pain. Which is why you need to have a doctor examine you. Often crossing one<APO>s legs prevents good circulation and that is why one will fall asleep, it may or may not have anything to do with the hand pain. It is perfectly nomal to have more than one condition at a time. Please see a doctor for a proper disagnosis, then come and tell us more. Take care, Annette""Check in your area for free/low cost clinics. Many communities have them, but they rarely advertise as they can<APO>t afford it, and usually have plenty of patients. I used to volunteer in one in my community and they had a way to get folks in to see specialists that were willing to donate their time. It often took awhile, but that is how it is for everyone these days. I would ask at Goodwill, Salvation Army, Catholic charities, etc. to see where these clinics might be in your area. You can also Google ""free clinics in (your area)"". Take care, Annette""I hope it all works out for you. Make sure if you did not get the brace directly from the doctor, that the brace is one that has a metal splint in it that goes up the palm of your hand. The ones made only of elastic material do not keep you from bending your hand/wrist as well. You can get both kinds at the drug store. Measure your hand and check the box so you get the right size, and the right or left hand as needed. Some can go on either hand. It is good to have two, one to wear and one to wash. The metal splint slides out to wash them. Take care, Annette""That is great!!! It sounds like the doctor was spot on with her diagnosis. I really respect doctors who are willing to examine a patient and use their own clinical judgement rather than do expensive tests when they are not entirely necessary. I had a nerve trapped in another part of my wrist, just below the thumb and did the splint and the injections and all. I ended up having a surgery that lasted 6 minutes, I stayed awake and watched. He released the nerve, stitched it up, and I was home in an hour. But you are already responding to the injection, I didn<APO>t at all. Be diligent with wearing the splint, especially at night. You will probably do fine. My husband had CT and all he did was wear the splint at night, and occasionally at work. It went away with only an occasional ache and then he wears the splint again at night for a few weeks. He doesn<APO>t like the idea of surgery when a splint can fix the problem so easily. Take care, Annette""I am so sorry to hear of the loss of your baby. I cannot diagnose your wife on line of course. Do the doctors know what first caused the severe headaches while she was still pregnant? How high is her fever, what time of day is it the highest? Does she have any other symptoms? I can understand your impatience with the doctors. I had typhoid many years ago, and because I had not left the USA, none of the doctors even thought of it. Finally, an ER doc at the hospital where I worked put all the symptoms together and tested me for it. I was in the hospital for 9 days, and did not recover my full health for several years. How is she doing emotionally? Losing a baby can cause postpartum depression. What does the doctor who took care of her during her pregnancy think about that? My best to both of you. Take care, Annette""I totally agree with you. I have not had that happen to me. I nearly always seek a second opinion for important things like surgery anyway. I have never had a doctor react badly. Perhaps there was some bad blood between them as they had once shared a practice. I know my current internist used to share a practice with a number of other internists, and they did not agree with the way she treated her chronic pain patients. I was told to only see her and to not ask the other doctors for pain med RXs. She ended up leaving that practice and going solo, and is so much happier now. Sorry you got a bad apple who treated you so badly. I hope things are working out better with the new PM doctor. Take care, Annette""According to what I have read it is commonly required for a person to check your ID before you pick up your RXs. That may just be in my state, but it also may also be a federal requirement. That way, no one can claim they never picked up their RX and ask for a second one. My doctor<APO>s office staff makes a copy of my ID whenever I pick a RX for a controlled substance up at the front desk rather than my doctor handing it to me. The pharmacy here is also supposed to do that when you pick up the schedulled drugs at the pharmacy, or if your spouse picks them up for you. That way they have a record of exactly who picked them up. Some pharmacies get lax about it if they know you by sight. As long as they use the same rules for everyone, I don<APO>t take offense. I am not sure where you found the info that oxycodone is not the best med for chronic pain and morphine, fentanyl and methadone are. I have never found any double blind studies that prove any opioid is better than another for chronic pain. I think it is up to the individual and their doctor. I believe it is the dosing that is the most important as far as what works best. That said, I would not ask for any med by name. If you are not getting enough relief to accomplish the necessary things in your life, just tell the doctor that. Tell him what things you are not able to do, and would like to do or need to do. He should offer you a change in med, a change in dose, an addition of some other drug or treatment to use in addition to what you are doing now. If you have already done what he is offering, then tell him so, and ask for something else. This is what I do, and so far it has worked. When it no longer works, I may have to rethink it, or perhaps find a different doctor. I do not do injections, procedures or surgery. That works for my doc as she is an internist and doesn<APO>t do those anyway. Take care, Annette""Yes, it is allowed to post links to other sites. I would love to read what you have found. I do try and check who wrote the studies, who paid for them, how many patients were included, and the methodology before I decide how much weight to give them. For instance, if the only studies done were a new brand name drug vs. a placebo drug, and were done by the drug company that makes the new drug, and only included 40 patients, I would give them less credibility than studies done by independent researchers, of the newer drug vs. an older drug in the same class, in hundreds of patients. I really try to look at randomised, double-blind studies first, as they are the gold standard of medical research. I did some medical research for some state committees on various drug families, and they gave us all a class on evaluating drug research. I use the guidelines they gave us. You might try asking your doctor for a referral to another pain management doc who commonly uses oral opioids in his practice for a consultation on oral meds to see if the other doctor has the same experience as your present doctor. Make it clear to him that you are not looking at switching doctors, just want more information about the different oral meds available before you give up on them altogether. Take a loved one with you to this appt. with a note pad to take notes, so the doctor knows there is a witness to whatever he says. Unless, of course, you are ready to give up on this guy altogether and find someone else. I don<APO>t suggest that unless you have enough meds to last you quite awhile while you look for someone else. Take care, Annette""I never tried Avinza, I stay away from all brand name drugs as much as possible. I used long acting generic morphine and recently switched to methadone. I use Norco for break through meds. So far, so good. My pcp manages my pain meds, but she works with me and has always listened to me when it comes to increases in dose. I am blessed to have her. I hope you are doing well. Take care, Annette""redster, I would ask the PM doc to please try changing your long acting med to something else. They have shown there is only a partial cross tolerance between opioids. For this reason, you may get better relief from less medicine when you switch over to a new one. I don<APO>t believe there is any reason to try ""new drugs"" as in newly crated ones, they just charge you more for those, but I have never seen any good evidence based studies that show any one opioid works better than another. I believe it is mainly a matter of the doctor prescribing the correct dose. We will probably all develop tolerance over time and need higher doses, that is an expected side effect of this class of drugs. Would your pcp be willing to write your pain prescriptions for you? Mine does. I recently changed long acting drugs for financial reasons, I want to stay out of the donut hole of Part D Medicare. I found much better relief on the new drug than I was getting on the drug I had used for ten years. Many interventional doctors prefer doing injections and procedures because they get better financial reimbursement than they do for appts. that just adjust meds, etc. Is your doctor getting frustrated because he cannot fix your pain for you? Ask him directly and see what he says. Take care, Annette""You might try checking with your local teaching hospitals, some of them have pain management clinics that actually combine medical doctors with other disciplines, like chiropractors and massage therapists. Take care, Annette""I have never had a problem getting a second opinion from a doctor, I just ask, and they say okay, or actually give me some names of doctors who do second opinions in that field of medicine. How have you approached the doctor for this? Take care, Annette""Gail, Thank you so much. I live about 5 hours from him, by car. But, he may decide to move up here if he can<APO>t find work down there soon. We talk on the phone about every other day. He has a fairly good support system. He never found a good AA place when he tried before, but I don<APO>t think he tried very hard before either. He is of the Buddhist leaning, not a Christian, and that made it hard for him. Many Christians are not very accepting of non-Christians. He is going to meetings every day now, and seems to have found some good meetings. I hope he finds a sponsor as soon as he decides where to live. I see alcoholism from a medical standpoint, so this is an area where you are far more the expert than I am. I know it is a recurring/relapsing illness, and have watched that over the years. There have been times where I truly did not expect to see him alive again, but he has done better since then. I hope that was his ""bottom"". I have read the ""Big Book"". I found it very interesting. Some of the scientific information that has come out since it was written contradicts some of the stuff in it, but it sure seems to be the way to go if you want to stop drinking. AA has the best success rating so far for alcoholism. Thank you so much for your prayers for him. you are far more helpful than you realize both for this problem and for many other things you post about. We all have our areas of expertise. For one thing, you are far more gentle and kind than I am. I just get to the point, and move on to the next post. Hugs, Annette""I read the Big Book many years ago when I was working in a heroin addiction rehab place in the early 1970s. It seemed like a good place to learn about alcoholism treatment as AA was the only thing that had any success back then. When my brother went to Kaiser for an outpatient rehab, 8 hours a day for 8 weeks, they recommended AA meetings also. He noted differences in the physiological teachings about alcoholism in the Kaiser program and the Big Book. They got into a lot of the physical effects of alcoholism and addiction. The Big Book is pretty old, one can<APO>t expect it to be up to date about that sort of stuff. I remember we discussed the differences back then, but that was 6-7 years ago. I printed out articles for him back then and mailed them to him as he had no computer access. I know he still has his copy of the Big Book, I will ask him as he goes through the steps again, what differences he has noticed. I think to find a meeting that fits you, you have to sample a bunch of different meetings at different places and times. I think perhaps this time he is putting in more effort to do so. He has commented that he has met a bunch of like minded people that have been very supportive. Last time it seemed like all the meeting he went to were too religious for him. This time around he is finding a better fit. He may also be more accepting, lol. I used to self-identify as a non-church going Christian, but after all the so called Christians I met about 15-20 years ago and the ones in the news who are not acting very ""Christian"", I decided that I did not want to be included in that group. I no longer self-identify as a Christian. I have found it best to often just keep that to myself. I have even attended a board on WebMD that was not at all welcoming to people of other faiths for several years. It was be a Christian or be condescended to or shunned. You have to be strong to put up with that kind of behaviour. I out waited those nitwits, most of them are gone now. I agree that it is not just religious groups that do that, but in my experience it is mainly majority religious groups. The thing that really hit me hard was a very Christian woman I worked with (in all the good ways that could be defined) was approached by the head of her small evangelical church, and he asked her to sign a letter stating that she had committed adultery during her marriage so that her ex-husband could remarry in that church and become a pastor. In their church one could only remarry after divorce if their spouse had committed adultery, and pastors were only assigned churches if they were married. She told him that she had never committed adultery, and he asked her to sign it anyway as a sign that she had forgiven her husband and was letting him move on. So, that ""good Christian man"" asked her to lie in writing about something as fundamental as committing adultery. It is Christians like him that encouraged me to stop identifying myself as a Christian. I was shocked, she signed it. She had only left her ex when he stopped hitting her and started hitting their children. Again, because the Christian counselor she went to told her it was her duty as a Chrisitan wife to obey her husband, and if she were a good wife he wouldn<APO>t have to hit her. Anyhow, that started me on my present path. One I am very comfortable on. I believe that Jesus was a great man, a prophet like many others before and after him, probably not the son of God. I do not believe the Bible is the word of God, I believe it is the word of many different men perhaps inspired by God, perhaps not. I also believe that there are other books written by men also inspired by God, or their belief in God. I do not find the Book of Mormon or the Koran to be less believable than the Bible. I have read them all, although not the entire Bible, and see why men wrote them. It would be interesting to know what the women of those times thought about these things. Thank you for all the help you give here. Hugs, Annette""Gail, your post last night was truly from your heart and that is all that matters. it really did help me more than you realize. I know that there are a lot of good Christians out there, after all here you are. I have read some C.S. Lewis, but oddly I just read an article about some of his later works and thought to myself that I should find some of them and look them over. He had an interesting take on religion and some of his books had underlying themes to do with religion. Are there any books of his that you would particularly recommend? Hugs, Annette""Thanks, I prefer non-fiction also. I read the ""Chronicles of Narnia"" when I was a teenager, I am not really into fantasy anymore either. I wrote down the titles, I will let you know when I find time to read one. It is never about finding someone who you always agree with, it is about the way one puts down their thoughts, and communicates them to others that matters. Thanks, again. Hugs, Annette""By ""equipment"" do you mean drugs? I would not recommend ordering drugs on line, you just do not know what you are getting, it is like buying on the street. Take care, Annette""Hi, Gail You have been here before and found help, just hold onto that thought while you search for a new doctor. You will find one. Could you please think good thoughts for my little brother. He went into a rehab place for 5 days to detox off of alcohol. He is doing well and staying sober so far. All my fingers are crossed. The longest he has stayed sober so far is about two years, any suggestions for long term success? I wish there were something more I could do to help you. Hugs, Annette""Always glad to share good news, lol. I have been to this doctor for about 11 years now. She sent me to a PM doc for a consult towards the end of last year. Our state asks doctors to get a second opinion if they are going to use opiates long term, and I had not been to one since shortly before I started seeing her. That way it is documented that the person has a specific reason she is being treated with opiates. The PM doc she sent me to, said I was the best managed chronic pain patient he had ever seen, the only addition to my treatment plan was to do my stretches twice a day instead of once a day. But, he said he was lucky to get his patients to do them once a day. He agreed with the treatment plan I had other than that one little tweak. I know I have a good doctor, I am very lucky. But I just interviewed doctors out of the phone book to find her. I had never worked in Oregon, and had no friends or family here to get a referal from. Hope all goes well with you. Take care, Annette""I see my own doctor every time I go in, she doesn<APO>t have PAs or NPs working for her. She charges $62.50 a visit, I happen to know because I had not met my deductible the last time I saw her, and had to pay the bill myself. Some of her patients see her monthly, I see her every other month as I have been with her for a long time, and my meds are stable for now. If I need an appt. I have always been able to get one by the next day if I am sick. My hubby<APO>s doctor also sees him every visit, and if you are sick you call in at 7 am, and ask for one of the same day appts. We have always been able to get one for him. We both feel very attached to our doctors, and feel that they care about us as people not just for the $$$. Take care, Annette""I really think at least 85% of ""fibro fog"" for me turned out to be DRUG fog. Once I got off of the antidepressants and klonopin, the fog passed for the most part. I remember my mom (did not have FMS) occasionally forgetting words as she aged, and have seen the same in my healthy friends as they passed menopause, I am not sure this is ""fibro fog"" but rather just a normal part of life. I have seen many other boards and the folks will say they have some sort of fogginess also though they call it something else. As far as diet goes, I have not seen any evidence based studies that show any specific dietary changes help with FMS pain or fatigue. The ""experts"" at our university medical center based FMS clinic say to just eat a well balanced diet and exercise adequately. I really believe that it is a matter of calories in and calories out as far as weight gain or weight loss. You have to count everything that goes into your mouth, and add up the calories. I found my idea of what a portion consists of was way out of whack. Much larger than what the real amount should be. I saw a nutritionist who taught me the basics. Although I have never put it all to use in a real effort to lose weight, I have also not forgotten her tips and suggestions. Now I find I am slowly losing weight, I have lost 32 pounds altogether without really dieting or trying to. My lab results are within normal limits, so my doctor just says to keep on doing what ever it is I am doing. Take care, Annette""Hi, Greg I worked at a heroin addiction treatment program for several years and never, ever heard of a heroin addict dying from withdrawals from opiates alone. Not in research, or in real life. Most older, experienced opiate addicts stated withdrawal was like a really bad case of the flu and lasted a week or so. As to your statement, ""...I guess my biggest point would be a Heroin addict, if they get their fix they will sometimes die so my point is well made PEOPLE DO DIE FROM WITHDRAWEL, it is nothing to play with."" If a heroin addict gets his fix (an injection of the drug) and dies, he is dying from the drug (usually an overdose) not from withdrawal. Withdrawal is when you do not get your fix. Opiate withdrawal does not cause seizures. Withdrawal from multiple drug (polypharmacy) abuse with opiates mixed with other drugs can cause seizures, but it is not form the opiates. My Merck Manual states the following, "" The withdrawal syndrome is self-limited and, although severely discomforting, is not life threatening."" Page 1587, 17th edition. Many addicts have other health issues and frequently other addictions in addition to the opiates, these must also be dealt with. Because we often give addicts who were mentally altered naloxone to reverse their OD, they often become agitated and combative and require restraints. It is suddenly coming out of a comatose state caused by the naloxone that causes the agitation, not the opiate that they took to begin with. If you find any evidence based research (not anecdotal material) that says pure opiate addicts (not coming off of other drugs also) going into withdrawal can have seizures and/or die, I would love to read it. I am always open to learning anything new. Take care, Annette""I do not know why you would tube and put people on the ventilator for opiate withdrawal. The respiratory symptoms of withdrawal are increased resting respiratory rate of greater than 16 breaths per minute. I am perfectly aware of intubating patients who have overdosed when their respiratory rate is decreased and respiratory depression sets in. Or intubating people to protect their trachea, but that happens in overdoses or seizures. Seizures are not a symptom of opiate withdrawal according to all the reference books I have. I have worked in ICU and withdrawal was not a problem, overdosing was. Did your patients often start out as an overdose, and then later go into withdralwals? The intubation, ventilators, cardiac arrest, multisystem organ failure, etc. sound more like an overdose than withdrawals. If your patients were lying to you about how much opiates they were taking, they may have also lied about what other drugs they were taking. Benzos are famous for causing seizures if withdrawn suddenly and completely. I have never worked at a hospital that admitted patients for opiate withdrawal alone, some patients who were admitted with other things were also opiate addicts. That complicates the picture when it comes to deciding on a cause of death. The detox facilities want people to come in and get help, offering meds and meals and a bed with nursing supervision helps people have a safe place to come off of drugs/alcohol and enter into treatment. Many of them do not have doctors on the premises, and the patients live in a dormatory type setting, not a hospital type setting, hardly seems like people are likely to die. I totally agree with you that all medication withdrawal should be supervised by a doctor. Take care, Annette""Where are the reports published? I have never heard of violent seizures from opiate withdrawal, especially as a first symptom. Wouldn<APO>t there just be dead heroin addicts laying everywhere if that were true. Seizures, especially severe ones usually compromise the airway, often causing aspiration and death. If most of us are on opiates we should be aware of this, because it is something we could all face, whether we want to talk about it or not. Take care, Annette""Give the half a pill at a time a chance and see how it works for you. If it doesn<APO>t work, you can go and tell him that you tried it anyway, and see what he says next. I really believe that it would be better to treat anxiety and/or depression with therapy than with meds, if only to avoid adding even more meds to the mix. Of course if that doesn<APO>t work or if your doctor feels meds would be useful in your case, they can work wonders for some folks. But, again, even if he advertises that he will help in that direction, unless he has specific training, I would rather see a shrink who does. A shrink or therapist who works with chronic pain patients would be ideal. They would be used to working with the issues that we deal with everyday. You might benefit from two books I have used over the years. ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns, MD focuses on cognitive behavioural therapy. ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"" by Dr. Margaret A. Caudill, MD, PhD is the second one. Both are available in soft cover for around $20 apiece at major book stores or online. Both have been really instrumental in me getting my life back and finding happiness again. They taught me to cope better with chronic pain and cured my anxiety and depression completely. Take care, Annette""In my experience people who are going through opiate withdrawal are not unconscious, certainly not enough to aspirate their own vomit, that happens with overdoses. You are absolutely correct in saying that aspiration will buy them a ventilator, it is very dangerous and often fatal. Just not with withdrawal. Seizures are not even listed as opiate withdrawal symptoms in any of my medical references. Take care, Annette""I have found that the way to measure your pain med needs is to add up everything you take in a 24 hour period, that would be your total daily dose. I think your doctor<APO>s suggestion of trying half a pill every two hours rather than one at a time over a longer time span might help you. I had a patient once who did her pain meds that way and it worked much better for her. She actually started taking her meds broken in quarters every hour instead of one whole pill every four hours. All you can do is try it and see how it works for you. Meds like BT meds that are written to be taken every four hours ""as needed for pain"", are not meant to be taken that way 24/7, the doctor expects you to have times on your long acting meds where you do not need to take the BT meds. If you still have pain 24 hours a day, your long acting meds probably need an increase in dose. Discuss this with your doctor. I agree with your doctor about seeing a shrink for the emotional problem related to your chronic pain, or any other reason also. They are specialists in their field, and are familiar with the required meds and therpies used for anxiety and depression. If you had a brain tumor you would see a neurologist, why not a shrink for anxiety and depression? Take care, Annette""Dying of a seizure related incident would certainly be on an informed consent sheet for opiate therapy if it were a possibility. They do list the important adverse effects. Doctors have us sign those forms to release them from liability in case any of that happens, so we cannot claim we didn<APO>t know and the doctors didn<APO>t tell us. If they go to the trouble of having us sign a form like that, and do not put a serious adverse effect like that on the form they open themselves up to huge law suits by us or our families after we die or end up brain dead on a vent for the rest of our lives due to aspiration. If seizures were a common initial sign of withdrawal like you posted earlier, I would not be on them. My husband<APO>s surgeon certainly told him of the possible adverse effects of hip replacement surgery, including death and infection prior to his surgery. It didn<APO>t scare him off. We all decide what we are willing to risk when we sign any informed consent sheet. Not all doctors care about their patients the way they should, but not all patients who get discharged from a doc<APO>s practice are totally blameless either. There is good and bad in all groups of people. But, all patients have a right to know what adverse effects are possible before they choose a treatment or make any decision that could affect their care. DTs or delerium tremens are associated with alcohol withdrawal. I have not heard that term used in reference to opiate withdrawal. I did look this up in the Merck Manual and Mosby<APO>s Medical Encyclopedia and both say it occurs after stopping alcohol intake abruptly or in alcoholics with head injuries or infections. Nothing about opiate use or withdrawal. Are some of the symptoms of DTs the same as opiate withdrawal? Yes. But many are different also. Specifically, the psychosis type symptoms and seizures, which are symptoms of alcohol withdrawal but not opiate withdrawal. Influenza also has many symptoms in common with opiate withdrawal. It is still comparing apples and oranges. I have worked in the ER, people come in all the time looking for opiates so they can avoid withdrawals, whether it is due to a doctor discharging them or for other reasons. They come in good shape while they still have some meds, and they come in in full blown withdrawals. Whether they have an addiction problem or a doctor problem, I feel they deserve compassionate medical care. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t believe that opiate withdrawal is a life threatening thing, I have never found any medical studies that show it is. Coming off of benzos however, can be life threatening, one can have seizures, etc. Many people with back pain take valium, a member of the benzo family. This is something to be very aware of. Take care, Annette""First, this is not evidence based medicine, it is a website of various medical detox/rehab programs that are selling their services. When looking at material on line or in medical research articles, always find out who wrote the article and what financial interests they may have. Some doctors do research for drug companies, and must declare any financial connection they have with the drug company. That said, if you read further down that page it gives a list of opiate withdrawal symptoms (that does not include seizures or DTs) and states that ""The above withdrawal symptoms are not life-threatening, but are extremely uncomfortable."" Take care, Annette""I am sorry you went through that experience. Even your neurologist said there are many types of seizures, he apparently did not say what kind you had. Nor did you say if you still take meds for them. The topomax is an antiseizure med, you took that along with another antiseizure med, along with vicodin, so it is a toss up from the info you have given as to whether the withdrawal caused the seizures or if it was coincidental. You also did not mention just what your other medical problems were, just that you have a lot of them. You believe it was due to the opiate withdrawal. I think that from what you have said that we don<APO>t really know why you had seizures. I would have called 911 at the first seizure, you are tough if you stuck it out for six before going to the doctor. Congratulations on the baby!!! Going off your meds to get pregnant and have a baby is a sign of great strength and good sense. Withdrawal is not a matter of addiction, it can happen to anyone using opiates for any reason. If you take them regularly and stop them suddenly or in too fast a taper, the withdrawal symptoms may happen. According to my drug handbook for nurses, opiates can be used fairly safely in pregnancy but only at a certain time in the pregnancy and only certain doses. But, used in the beginning or late in pregnancy they are NOT considered safe for the baby. It is very complicated, and requires careful monitoring by an experienced doctor. Many OBs would just rather we stop all meds to get pregnant. Boy or girl? Take care, Annette""My internist writes my pain management prescriptions. I don<APO>t see a pain management doctor. She is my pcp. You might try asking your pcp for help, or try a different pcp. You should not have to suffer without any medical care at all. I have no idea why the doctor changed your meds, or why your urine test came out wrong. I do know that the urine screening tests have to be accurately analyzed. Some drugs break down into metabolites and will show positive for other drugs. If a doctor does not know how to use these tests properly, the patient suffers for it. My doctor sends out her patients<APO> urine to an outside lab it takes awhile to come back. Did your doctor do the test in the office while you were still there? I have never heard of a med that has morphine and naltrexone in it. Suboxone has buprenorphine and naloxone in it. The buprenorphine is a narcotic. Perhaps that is what she was talking about. I don<APO>t know. Take care, Annette""I agree with you that it is very important not to run out of our meds. I am aware that there is anecdotal evidence from people who relate having had seizures while withdrawing from opiates. There should be articles based on medical evidence that shows seizures are a part of opiate withdrawal if the seizures are indeed a part of the opiate withdrawal syndrome and not caused by other medical problems. All I am asking for are links to such material or the names and authors of such articles. I am well aware that many people who come here believe this from their own personal experiences. I am looking for medical documentation of opiate withdrawal syndrome that includes seizures to balance out the anecdotal information. I have done searches and only found seizures mentioned in neonates going through withdrawal from dependence in the uterus. That is not the subject here. Thanks for your response. Take care, Annette""Your neurologist was right on the money, treat the seizures first, then worry about the cause. They can be deadly, and it is important to stop them. I hope they are gone now and you are no longer needing that medicine too. I really believe that PM patients who need some kind of meds while they are pregnant should be treated by high risk OB doctors who are used to managing patients on meds that they need. Some doctors are willing to manage meds and a pregnancy at the same time, especially in conjunction with other specialists. Women who have successfully dealt with pregnancy while taking other meds have posted at WebMD before. Maybe you can do a search of the exchanges, I don<APO>t know just how to do that with the new format here. Maybe they have a pregnancy exchange here that has experiences like that from other women. Have you checked out OB doctors at a university medical center where they manage high risk patients? Best of luck. Congrats on the beautiful little girl. Take care, Annette""I was tried on that drug also, it is a common approach for migraine treatment. I can<APO>t remember how long I was on it. No side effects that I recall, didn<APO>t seem to work too well for me. Take care, Annette""ALWAYS check with your OB doctor before taking anything while you are pregnant. Not all doctors keep up on everything having to do with drugs and pregnancy. Take care, Annette""I would suggest you use very effective birth control for now and meet with a high risk OB doctor to discuss what meds you can take when during your pregnancy/breastfeeding and what else might be available for your symptoms. Some things are absolute, others are negotiable depending on when during your pregnancy you take them. Same with breastfeeding. Of course breastfeeding is best, but many people my age were fed formula exclusively and are none the worse. Nowadays, formula is far better made, and anyway there are many reasons why some women are unable to breastfeed, but that is no reason not to have kids. The best way to avoid drugs during the critical first trimester is to carefully plan your pregnancy. Some drugs require a washout period, and you will need to stop them prior to even trying to become pregnant. This also gives you a better idea of whether stopping your drugs is a good option for you. I would agree that antidepressants are problematic, however opiate pain meds can be used safely when the dose and timing during the pregnancy is done correctly. Cognitive behavoural therapy is good for many things besides depression and may help you reduce your need of some meds. These decisions should be made with your OB not your neurologist though. The neurologist can tell you what meds might help the pain/symptoms of your conditions, but the OB is better trained to tell you if they are safe for the baby or not. After you get all the info you are better able to make decisions. Often I have read women post that their FMS symptoms improved during their pregnancies, but not always. I don<APO>t know about MS, I know you can have long remissions, but do not know the relationship of those with pregnancy. Unfortunately, only you can make the decision whether or not you can tolerate a pregnancy and child care. Do you have any kids yet? They are exhausting, but wonderful. Discuss all the possible ways to have and rear a family with your spouse, perhaps if you need to stay on all your meds, but feel you can raise a child, adoption would be a better option for you. How much help will your family be able to offer during pregnancy and babyhood when sleep is hard to get? Is your hubby a hands on kind of guy or one who lets the wife do most of the work? His present behavior is the best indicator of future behavior. If he is no help at all with housework, I wouldn<APO>t expect much with help with housework or baby care. There is no absolute right or wrong way to divide labor in a family, the right way is the way which works best for your family. If having a baby is not the right thing for you at this time, do other things to occupy yourself for now. We never know when the medical researchers will come up with something that will help or cure us enough to do far more than we are now able to do. Take care, Annette""What position are you in when you sleep? It may also have something to do with how hard/soft the surface is that you are sleeping on. Take care, Annette""You might also try a memory foam mattress topper. We got one that is four inches thick, and a 5.5 density. I had used a 4 inch thick egg crate topper for years, and my husband and I both like the memory foam better. Most mattress stores will let you try a new mattress for at least 30 days before you decide for sure if you want one. We already had a fairly new, good quality, firm surface mattress that we liked pretty well. We did not want to spend the money on a new mattress. Take care, Annette""We put a heated mattress pad over the memory foam topper, followed by a regular sheet. We don<APO>t feel any kind of plastic feeling. I loved my water bed, I had it for years, but my husband hated it. He liked the heat, hence the heated mattress pad, but he hated trying to turn over or get in and out of it. I keep plenty of pillows stacked on my side of the bed, and put one between my knees, and one in front of me to lean on, whenever I sleep on my side. Take care, Annette""I agree about the price of new mattresses. That was one reason we went with the memory foam mattress topper rather than the memory foam mattress. Try whatever you feel might work for you. Take care, Annette""It sounds like the bed is firmer than the sofa is. Perhaps just the softer surface is giving more underneath you. Have you seen your doctor since you were injured? I would suggest you do that, and then explain to him what you have done so far and where you seem to sleep better. See what he says. Take care, Annette""I have had it for over ten years now, I am 59. I do not find it is getting any worse as I get older. The one friend of mine who has it has not seemed to get worse over the years either, she is about 3 years younger than me. In fact, I feel better equipped to handle it as I get older. I think I just have started to rethink the important things in life. I have learned to be happy for what I can still do rather than grieve over what I cannot do. Take care, Annette""The FMS Exchange here at WebMD moves more quickly than this board or at least it used to when I was last there. This exchange is also more information-focused, if you are looking for specific info or medical stuff, this is the place to come. If you just want to shoot the breeze and socialize, the FMS Exchange may be a better fit. Take care, Annette""Back in college I was a killer badminton player, lol. Way back then, in Calif. PE was required every semester until you turned 21. I took it the entire time I was in community college getting my nursing degree, four whole semesters. I took it because it was available Wed. nights, it was the ONLY PE class that fit in with my schedule. A friend of mine that took it the first semester for the same reason continued to take it until we graduated because we had so much fun. Great memories.... I am sorry to say that all I can suggest about your knee is to ice it and elevate it when it hurts, try to avoid doing those drills that bother it until you can see a doctor or until it is pain free. If possible, see the doctor that did your surgery and get an evaluation. If that is not possible, try the school clinic or an orthopedic surgeon of your choice. If you can get a hold of your old records and any flims that were done last year, go ahead and do that, so you can take them to whatever doctor you do go see. Knees are complicated joints, please do not just try and ignore this and hop it goes away. Take care, Annette""Going through all the med changes can make me crazy. I have been stable for many years now, but your post reminded me of the early days with FMS when I was changing from one antidepressant to another, and trying other meds as well. For me, the craziness and memory problems ended up being caused by the antidepressants. Once I stopped those, my fogginess decreased by about 85%. I tolerated opiates rather well. I used cognitive behavioural therapy instead and got good results, far better than with antidepressants. We all respond differently to meds. Be very careful until you figure out what is causing your problems. It took a car accident, I rolled my own car, to set me straight. Thank God, no one else was hurt, it totaled my car though. After that, I stopped all my meds completely. Then my doctor and I decided to just start one drug at a time, and treat single symptoms with specific drugs. I took an opiate for the pain and ambien for sleep/RLS. Since you have lost your PCP, you will have to find a new one. That will make things more difficult at first. But, hopefully, you will find a good doc that you feel you can work with. You can only do the best you can with what you have. Take care, Annette""Yes, I am the same old Annette. I have been here for about 11 years now. Everyone does the taper off of antidepressants differently. I was on effexor years ago, and I tapered off of it in about two weeks. No problems at all. I went off of prozac without any taper, no probelms. My hubby was on cymbalta for pain management for a couple of years, I tapered him off in 2-3 weeks after his hip surgery, no problems at all. Years ago, my son was on Paxil, he opted to take himself off of it, without any taper at all when he felt he was better, after about 6 months on it. He told me when it was a done deal, he was already off. He was 16 or 17 at the time. He had no problems either. Some people complain of all kids of withdrawal symptoms when they go off of antidepressants. I think the best thing is to work with whatever doctor you are seeing, and go slow. See what happens to you, and go from there. I also think when you are replacing one antidepressant with another, especially one from the same family, you are less likely to have any withdrawal symptoms at all. It is more like switching from one opiate to another. It sounds like you are doing well with the Duragesic taper. Hang in there, you will be fine. Take care, Annette""That depends on the injury itself and how bad it was. What does the doctor say? Ask him specifically at what point he feels you should start to worry if you are still having your present symptoms. If you phrase it like you just don<APO>t want to keep bothering him if it isn<APO>t necessary, he should be cool with the question. Some injuries take quite awhile to heal and for the swelling in the cord area to go down. Take care, Annette""Are you still seeing the surgeon who did your surgery, or are you seeing a PM doctor who does not like to write RXs? Surgeons are not well schooled in pain management other than right after surgery. I would look for someone to replace the surgeon right away for pain management, have him in the wings at least for when the surgeon says no more opiates. You had a HUGE surgery, and should expect a lot of pain for awhile at least. You are not even a month postop, so a lot of your pain may be from the surgery itself. Give it a little time, and see how things go. I bet your symptoms change over time as you get farther out from your surgery. I would look for a PM doc who uses a comprehensive approach to pain management, using all kinds of interventions including oral meds and opiates. I would avoid using a PM doc who really prefers to only using injections and procedures for pain management. Take care, Annette""I would ask the surgeon to refer you to a PM doc if he is unable to relieve your pain. I would not do this over the phone, do it at a regular appt. when you are face to face. Or you can ask your pcp to refer you. I do not recommend doing any business over the phone with your doctors, always face to face in the exam room. PM doctors are not just in the business of writing scripts. They use many different kinds of techniques to decrease pain levels, oral meds are only part of it. Take care, Annette""I am sorry, I don<APO>t have an answer to this question. You might also post it over on the Migraine exchange while you are waiting for folks here to respond. Perhaps there are also folks over there who may have more info. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Greg, again you have not posted any medical research that I or anyone else can go read and judge for ourselves. You are only posting your own personal experience and your opinion. I for one, happen to disagree and would like to see objective, evidence based studies or research to support the contention that ""severe seizures are one of the initial symptoms of opiate withdrawal"" or that they are a part of opiate withdrawal at all. If you have any, please post links, we can all go and make our own decisions about this. I would be happy to be proven wrong in my opinion, if you have anything objective to back up yours. Thanks, Annette""Teresa is one of the nurses here, I was posting to her about ACLS. If anything my post regarding ACLS might have been taken as condescending to other members, I apologize. ACLS stands for advanced cardiac life support. These are the protocols used for cardiac emergencies, they have evolved and changed over the years as new research has been done. I used this example because I assumed Teresa and other medical personnel would see the correlation between research and change in medical practice. Offending anyone was not my intent. Again, if any of the members were offended, I apologize. Take care, Annette""No reason to feel sorry. We disagree on some things, and agree on others. That is how it is at any public message board. Take care, Annette""Hi, Betty Thank you for responding with your link and your own story. I tried the link and I must either subscribe to ""Chest"", the journal in which it appears, or purchase the article. I am not willing to do either. The title alone was not enough to say that the symptoms were caused by the addiction or if they were co-existing conditions. I have Googled seizures in opiate withdrawal and did not find medical sources that connected seizures with opiate withdrawal. I have also done searches on Medscape and other medical resources that I have in the ""Merck Manual"" and ""The Massachusetts General Hospital Handbook of Pain Management"". These all say that opiate withdrawal is uncomfortable but not dangerous or life threatening. I posted some of the links I found in the threads where we were discussing this. I have read about some doctors feeling that opiates can actually increase the amount of pain one is having. This is a rare side effect from what I have read. I have read posts from a few people who related that once they got off of opiates altogether, they felt they had less pain than when they started. The statins are fairly well known for causing joint and muscle pain as a side effect, I was not aware that methotrexate and ibuprofen cause a bad interaction. I have never needed those drugs or had to give them to a patient. How long were you taking them before you realized they were causing increased pain? How long did it take after you were off of them, for that pain level to go back down to your normal level? I feel that we should all try all the options available to us and not just focus on opiates as a cure all for pain. You discovered that the biological med you chose works fairly well for you, even though it is pricey. Best of luck, Annette""I simply cannot afford top subscribe to a journal to read just one article. If you are, please email me the article and I will be happy to read it and glean from it whatever info they have. Over the years I have used both book information and skills learned on the job. I never had a patient have seizures or die from opiate withdrawal, including when I worked at a heroin detox clinic for three years. Some of my clients there used more opiates than we could even dream of in pain management. I believe in using both research material and on the job skills. Anytime you wish to post a link to a medical journal article or quote parts of an article and give the title and authors, I am willing to listen. Take care, Annette""Do you not want to take daily meds for some reason? My old doctor who worked with me through horrible migraines for many years always suggested if someone was getting more than three migraines a month, to try daily meds. If you have had migraines for two and a half weeks, and your imitrex doesn<APO>t work, the daily meds sound reasonable to me too. All the articles I have read seem to hold that same thought for treatment. I had migraines primarily on the right side of my head, then after a number of years, they appeared on the left side occasionally. My doctor did not worry about it, he said that can happen. Take care, Annette""There is no way for any of us to diagnose you on line. It would be best to have a doctor check this, especially if you are not better in a few days. Take care, Annette""You could buy all kinds of what are now controlled substances before the US legislation (Harrison Act, I think that is the name of it, might be Harris Act, might be something else entirely??) started the current list of drugs which are controlled now. I am not sure what this has to do with the current discussion on death and seizure by opiate withdrawal, but it is interesting how things have evolved over the years. Take care, Annette""Suboxone is not a pure opiate, it is buprenorphine and naloxone, a combination drug commonly used for opiate detox once the opiates are completely out of your system. This is because the naloxone is an opiate reversal agent. It is now used for some patients for pain management also. Buprenoprphine is also available alone as Subutex. It is a narcotic analgesic, but it is a MIXED opiate agonist/antagonist type drug (like Stadol is). According to my ""Drug Information Handbook for Advanced Practice Nursing"" it can precipitate acute withdrawal in opioid dependent individuals. It should not be given to opiate dependent folks until at least four hours after their last dose of shortacting opiates, or until withdrawal symptoms start according to this book. Opiates (the drugs we were talking about in the previous posts) are purely opiate agonists in the way they work chemically, which affects how they work when you come off of them. Glad to hear you were able to continue teaching after you retired. I continued to volunteer in a free clinic until 2008, it was very rewarding. I continue to be a licensed RN. I am not registered on the site, so I could not read the whole article. If it is free, I will join, but if it costs $$, I will skip it and get the info I can from free sources. I would love it if you could reproduce the information here. Take care, Annette""Google Health had an article son opiate withdrawal also. Try going to - https://health.google.com/health/ref/Opiate withdrawal. In case the link does not work, I just Googled ""opiate withdrawal"" and it came up in the list of resources. It also says opiate withdrawal is not life threatening and lists the symptoms, no seizures. Take care, Annette""By the way, this is from the US National Library of Medicine via Medline. Take care, Annette""Here is one I tried the other night and did something wrong apparently. http://www.divisiononaddictions.org/html/publications/redcard.pdf I copied and pasted it and tried it out and it worked, so I will keep my fingers crossed. Take care, Annette""Here is another one. This one is actually a very interesting read as it goes back historically and discusses the difficulties of figuring out the cause of death from the records left behind. http://www.drugtext.org/library/books/epidemiology/chapter16.htm Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know if what I had was similar to what you are having, but I used to get quick jabs in my head, my doctor and I called them ""ice pick pains"". I also had migraines, and he said many people with migraines got them. With any new or worsening head pain, you should go to your doctor and get it checked out. Occasionally, it can be something serious like a bleed in your brain or a tumor. You can<APO>t make those kinds of diagnoses on line. Take care, Annette""My hubby had a headache and thought it was just a migraine as usual. I made him go after a few days of the same horrible pain, it turned out he had a bleed inside his skull. he required medical care. He could have died. He was one of those people who did not want to take up the doctor<APO>s time. Please see a doctor soon. Take care, Annette""Hi, Brenbren What was your original dose of pain meds for the whole day (24 hours). My understanding was then you started on a 25 mcg./hr fentanyl patch with the plan of going down on the percocet 10s. When you wished to go up on the patch to 50 mcg./hr every 3 days, they asked you to turn in your percocets and you did. Then you increased the frequency to every 48 hours rather than every 72 hours. That is still not enough, and you are taking 3-4 percocet a day. Did the doctor give you more percocet? You didn<APO>t mention if you had been taking a long acting opiate along with the percocets to begin with, before you started the patches. Or what other medications you are on, antidepressants, antiseizure meds, etc. What non-drug treatments you have been on. I would just keep a careful journal of your meds, and pain and activity levels. Take it with you to go see him and explain to him what you are feeling and what your goals are for activity. It may be that the fentanyl patch is not the best med for you. Perhaps you will have to take a different long acting opiate or even try something else entirely. It sounds like he has been very cooperative and helpful so far. I apologize if you have given a more detailed history of your treatments in another post, and I just do not remember them right now. Take care, Annette""I think taking your husband with you is a great idea. It seems more difficult for doctors to brush off women if their spouses are present. Take your list of things to discuss with you, and until you have discussed them all do not get up to leave. If he tries to change the subject or turns to walk out himself, just gently repeat the concern until he responds to it. Your husband can back you up with this by also repeating the question as needed. You and your hubby might try practicing this before hand. Was the roxicodone 15 mg. 4x a day working for you? Other than having to take so many pills, were you getting adequate relief from your pain? If you were then I would think that the oxycodone drugs may be the best way for you to go, because the fentanyl is not working as well apparently. What about using a long acting oxycodone 2-3 times a day with a shortacting oxycodone as a BT med as needed a couple of times a day? Taking pills may be the best option for you. We would all love to just not need pills any more. The fentanyl patches are not a good option for me for other reasons, so I just have not even tried them. Taking meds twice a day, morning and night, would be best for me as far as remembering them, but I do have to take mine three times a day. They do work the best though. That<APO>s life. I don<APO>t know if the injections/procedures made your pain worse, or if it would have gotten worse any way, there really is no way of knowing. Just go on from here. If you don<APO>t want the implant, just say ""No, thank you."" and change the subject. I personally would not try any implantable device until I had tried ALL the combinations of ALL the possible pain medications. That is just me. I start with the least invasive and move up only as needed. Take care, Annette""Thank you for your military service. Talk to your pcp about what kinds of exercise would be best for you. There are recumbent bikes, stationery bikes, both of which would take weight off your joints. But only your pcp would know how to adjust exercise with your pacemaker, etc. Please do not think about exercise like you used to. For folks with chronic pain, it is start low and increase slowly!! My pain management doctor suggested exercising 3-5 minutes a day, 2-3 times a day to start out with, then increase each exercise period by 1-2 minutes once a week. He said it was fine to start out with stretching and walking, then stretching again for the cool down if I wanted to. He suggested working up to 30 minutes total each day on most days. He suggested slowing down or decreasing the amount of exercise, but not stopping it entirely for a flare. Again, this is what he suggested for me, you need to speak to your pcp to find out what is best for you. My PM doc<APO>s opinion was that nearly everyone can tolerate this level, then work up very slowly. My husband and I got a very small hot tub with a thermostat that we can set to what we prefer. We keep it in our patio. This is something you would also discuss with your doctor and try out before you buy one of your own. I have FMS, he has OA and a hip replacement. It works for both of us, but in a different way. Take care, Annette""Talk to your doctor about how to start an exercise program. Mall walk if necessary, find something to do that you will enjoy. A PT lady once told me that she asks her home health patients to make a double trip to the bathroom each time they need to go, she said this was a good way to start. Get out of the headset that you will lose all the weight right away. Stop weighing yourself, just weigh in at the doctor<APO>s appts. You need to lose the weight slowly. I attended two classes that both told us to try and eliminate the intake of 200 calories a day, and exercise to the tune of 200 calories a day. I have lost over 74 pounds just doing that. Ice cream and MMs remain part of my eating plan every day, lol. Take care, Annette""Please see your doctor, he/she is able to examine you and order any labs or imaging studies needed. Take care, Annette""I have read a couple of medical studies that used double blind randomised trials and showed that darvocet was no more effective than plain tylenol. My personal experience many years ago was the same, no more relief than I got from Tylenol. However, a good nurse friend of mine swears by darvocet and used it post op with good effect. She says it is better for her than vicodin. Another friend relates the same thing, she has used it for other kinds of pain in addition to post op pain. Both only used it for acute pain, not for chronic pain, so that is a major difference both in how well it may work and with the possible adverse effects. Nausea and vomiting usually go away as side effects of opiates within a few weeks of regular use. Taking the right opiate orally before your pain gets bad enough to go to the ER for an injection is also important and usually possible once you figure it all out. Demerol is an old drug that is rarely used anymore because its metabolites may cause serious side effects, even seizures. Morphine is used in injection form in the ER and can also be taken by mouth at home if the Darvocet doesn<APO>t work, as can oxycodone. You won<APO>t know until you try them if they will cause side effects or not. I am kind of surprised that your first RX of darvocet was for 120 pills since you have so much difficulty with side effects. That is a lot of pills if you find after several doses that you cannot take it or it does not work. My personal opinion really doesn<APO>t matter much. I would not use it again because it doesn<APO>t work for me, nor is it prescribed for the severity of pain I now have. I am glad that you are having a good experience with it so far. Take care, Annette""Dogvet, I am a bit confused. You also posted under ""Discogram"" that your husband had an artificial disc implanted with very good results. You had only mentioned pain as a symptom prior to surgery. I thought the pain was fixed by the surgery and implant, but I must have misunderstood. I have never personally used medical hypnotherapy, but have known people who did, they did not get long lasting pain relief at all, and were not able to decrease their pain meds. I am glad to hear it works for some folks. I think that is true of many therapies, they help some people and not others. Take care, Annette""It sounds like your husband has gone through what many of us have gone through, multiple procedures and some relief. There does not seem to be any one therapy that takes care of all of our pain. I have always claimed that if we try a number of chronic pain treatments we will get some relief from each of them and end up better off than if we only tried one at a time. Glad he has found some relief. Take care, Annette""I think this is a question to ask your neurosurgeon. Did you have surgery or was he a consultant on your case? Take care, Annette""I started having migraines at about age 35, and they continued and got worse and worse until I passed through menopause at age 52. About the same time I started on an antiseizure drug for other kinds of chronic pain and they improved, although they did not go away completely. All I can suggest is to see your doctor and keep trying different combinations of migraine preventative and rescue drugs until you find the right combo. Take care, Annette""Yep. I don<APO>t take mine in the bathroom or keep them in there, but you are right, I don<APO>t take them in front of anyone either. My husband is retired so he is here all day, but I don<APO>t take meds in front of him. I usually take meds about three times a day, but privately. I wish things were like they were pre-pain too, but they probably aren<APO>t ever going to be. I hope things work out for you so you don<APO>t have to worry so much and so that your pain is under better control. Take care, Annette""I have DDD in my neck and I also have FMS. Other than my spine I do not have any joint disease that I know of. I do not really differentiate one pain from another because the FMS is widespread and would be hard to separate from other kinds of pain. The neurontin decreases my total pain levels and I no longer have any side effects from it. I have never claimed that it would do so for everyone, or for all kinds of pain, or that no one would have any side effects from it. I consider it only one part of all the things I do for pain management. I do not count on any one thing to fix my pain. Take care, Annette""Hi, BrenBren I am lucky because my husband has never been like that. When I met him he had non-Hodgkins Lymphoma and was told he had about six months to live if he stopped treatment. He opted to stop treatment because it made him so sick. After a few months, he did not really feel any worse, and he had gained a bit of weight. He was 6<APO>3"" and 145 pounds when I met him. He said he probably should get a job, and he did. It has been 20 years and he got well. It took about ten years to get him up to 170 pounds, a normal weight for him. He knew what it was like to face death, and be in pain. He has never judged me. I got sick about ten or twelve years ago. It got progressively worse for a few years, then leveled out with good management. He had AVN in one hip and ended up having that hip replaced about 18 months ago. He had been on pain management for two years prior to that and continued to work to give us both health insurance until he and I were both eligible for Medicare. He is a total blessing to me, he rubs my feet and back when I am in pain, he never complains about undone housework, he does all the cooking for us. He tells me to rest all the time. I understand that people have spouses that are not supportive, I had two of them before I was married to my present husband. It is not fun to be ill and have no support system in place. I don<APO>t know how or why people continue in those kinds of relationships. If I had, I would never have found my sweetie. That said, I still feel awkward taking meds in front of someone. I try to make sure I don<APO>t when I visit my son and his family. I try to pretend I am fine, and collapse when I get home, lol. They know how I am and they make sure I have rest times between activities, but I want the grandkids to remain as innocent of all this as possible for as long as possible. Take care, Annette""He is a total blessing for me. I always get sentimental about my sweetie. Not all the family is as good as he is. I also take my meds privately. Only my sister has ever said anything negative, but I feel self conscious about taking them in front of people. I have found that the best answer when she asks about my current treatment, is just to say I am taking what my doctor prescribes and as long as it works I am happy. I tell her I will share any info she has with my doctor and together we will decide what to do with my treatment plan. I just go through the pain with the grandkids, and rest later. It is worth it. It would be much harder if they lived nearby and I had to do it all the time. Take care, Annette""BrenBren, I will leave the patches up to you folks who use them. The only comment I have about them is to ask if your rice pack is a heated one or not? If it is heated, I would discuss placing it directly over the patch with your pharmacist. It is my understanding that one should never place a heating pad or anything like that directly on a patch as heat alters the amount of the drug that is absorbed into your body. Regarding the neurontin, I do get a decrease in pain levels from taking it, along with some other advantages. I have adjusted the dose and time that I take it over the years, and can definitely tell the difference. I have been on it for many years, and would not opt to go off of it for as long as it continues to help. If only narcotics offer you relief, and you don<APO>t want more pills, and the fentanyl does not work for you, what options are their for you that your doctor has not tried? Maybe that is why he is pushing the SCS???? Take care, Anentte""WebMD is looking for a new expert for us. Dr. Huh is very busy with his practice and has found himself overextended. The experts are volunteers. Take care, Annette""I would not make the decision that these are withdrawal migraines just based on what you tell us here. Going from Feb. 25 until March 13 before they started would suggest to me that they are not related. I assume that his doctor told you to stop the other meds you mentioned. The amitriptyline is commonly used for migraine prevention and is a tricyclic antidepressant. It takes several weeks at least for it to start working. The doctor gave you the other rescue medicine, the torodol, to use when he gets a migraine meanwhile. Does it work? If that does not work, call the doctor at his office and tell him. You may have to take him to be seen before his regular appt. if he does not get any relief. Reglan is used for migraines, not just for nausea. I have used it for over 15 years for migraines. I take 10 mg. orally in addition to aspirin 925 mg. as soon as my migraine begins. Nothing works 100% of the time. I also keep compazine 10 mg. orally at home to take if the rglan/aspirin does not work. I use a triptan migraine med is all else fails. Not all of these meds may be appropriate for kids, only his doctor can tell you what is appropriate for kids. Has he ever had migraines before? It sounds to me like they are doing what is appropriate for migraine treatment. Take care, Anentte""Oxycodone is much stronger than morphine, mg. for mg. I believe slightly over 6 mg. of oxycodone is equianalgesic to 10 mg. of morphine. That is not taking into account the partial cross tolerance factor. You were prescribed the same number of mgs. per day of both drugs, but since the oxycodone is stronger you should get better relief than you did with the morphine. If you don<APO>t, go see your PM doctor and tell him. I prefer to have a doctor who is willing to consult with other doctors when he feels it is in the best interests of his patient. I don<APO>t want a doctor who thinks he knows it all. No one knows it all. It is your pain management doctor<APO>s job to manage your pain. The diagnosing is mainly up to your other doctors. I am so sorry to hear that you have a tumor somewhere that will require removal in April. I hope that goes well. You have a lot going on right now, I hope you find the strength to carry on, or to ask for help when you need it. Take care, Annette""I am a bit confused, are you taking a long acting oxycontin along with the methadone on a set schedule, or a short acting oxycodone as a break through med? It is very unusual to take two long acting opiates at once, and of questionable value according to what I have read. Some people do not realize that oxycodone short acting is different than oxycontin and use the terms interchangably. Check your bottles and see exactly what the label says, or call your pharmacist and ask him which were prescribed. If you have increased the amount of methadone you are on since you were last on oxycodone at 80 ms. three times a day it may all balance out. No one here is as well trained as your doctor or knows you as well. This is best discussed with him face to face. Take all your meds in their bottles with you to show him and write down exactly what he wants ou to do. My doctor gives me short acting breakthrough meds that are prescribed every 4 hours as needed for pain, but there is still a monthly limit on how many pills I should take per month. Neither she nor I expect that I will need to take them every four hours, every day all month long. If I did need that many, then it would be time to increase the long acting med I take. But, on the days that I have a flare she wants me to go ahead and take them every four hours. Discuss with your doctor exactly how he feels you should be taking the oxycodone and if it is the short acting or the long acting variety. If he did not write for enough meds to last a month, try and go see him and get it straightened out, either at an early appt. or at your regular one. Take care, Annette""As far as the tumor, take it one step at a time. Until you have a biopsy you don<APO>t know exactly what you have. My brother in law has a gastric tumor that they thought was cancer, but when they finally went in and took a piece of it for a biopsy it was benign and all they had to do was go in and remove the entire thing. That is a long way from chemo and radiation. My husband had cancer and 20 years ago he stopped the chemo and radiation treatment, the doctors gave him 6 months to live. He is still alive and kicking. It went away. No medical explanation, but we have been very happy. So try not to worry too much just yet. One day at a time. Take care, Annette""Then why didn<APO>t you refer her to a pharmacist or her doctor? Deciding not to confuse someone with details about drugs can be very dangerous. I, for one, do not ever tell anyone to change their meds or dosages without speaking to their doctor first. Take care, Annette""Hi, KatBaskin Try to be patient, although I know that is tough when you are in pain. Give the patch a cycle or two on the new dose and see how it goes. The methadone has a long half life but it is a good sign that you have been off of it for two days and can<APO>t tell that you miss it. Once you feel like you don<APO>t have to worry about withdrawal, you can concentrate on pain management. It often takes several adjustments on the patch to find the correct dose. I have personally not used the patch as I love my hot tub, and that is a no-no with the patch according to my doctor. Take care, Annette""Yes, what I call a cycle would be the time you go between fentanyl patch changes. I have not seen any evidence based studies that show any opioid is better at relieving pain than any other opioid. I also have not seen it in patients that I have had or in my own experience with opiates. That does not mean it does not exist. But, I think it is all in the dosing myself. Some researchers feel that the occasional patient has certain genetic reasons for getting better relief from one drug than another, but that it is fairly rare and there is no way to test for it currently, other than trying different drugs. Someday they will hopefully be able to prescribe drugs based on our genetic makeup and they will be able to find the best drugs for each of us for various illnesses. We aren<APO>t there yet, though. I feel that when someone switches from one opioid to another it is different than withdrawing off of an opioid without going to a different one. When you go from 60 mg. of methadone to 0 in a week, but you are replacing it with fentanyl it may not be too fast. (Certainly if you were going from 60 mg. to 0 and not taking a different opioid, I would think that it was too fast to go without having withdrawal symptoms.) When you say you had to take 10 mg. of methadone, what symptoms were you having that made you take it? Were you having increased pain, abdominal cramps, a runny nose, hot or clod flashes, muscle twitches, etc.? Write down exactly what symptoms you were having, when they started, when you took that methadone and the last dose before that, and how long they lasted after you took the recent dose of methadone. Take that information with you to your doctor, it will help him decide if you are doing as expected or if he needs to adjust your fentanyl patch dose or your breakthrough meds. You mentioned that you took oxycodone 15 mg. 2 pills three times a day. Had you already taken those for the day? Because they are immediate acting meds, they might have worked faster than the 10 mg. of methadone in relieving your symptoms. Discuss this with your doctor also, he may or may not feel that it is better to use these meds rather than methadone for the symptoms you had. Methadone is a naturally long acting med and is generally used on a set schedule, rather than as needed. I can<APO>t remember off hand what all the drugs are that you have tried. There are long acting versions of morphine, oxycodone, and Opana, as well as levorphanol, methadone, and the fentanyl skin patch. Often switching long acting meds can lead to using less medicine due to the partial cross tolerance between opiates. I used generic long acting morphine for over 10 years, and I had no medical complaints at all. I switched for economic reasons, not relief problems. Take care, Annette""I would stop seeing surgeons. I don<APO>t believe that surgery is the answer for back pain, even back pain with sciatic pain down the legs for as long as ANY other therapies help enough to keep going. I believe that back surgery of any kind should be the last resort after trying all the other therapies available. If the problem is you don<APO>t have the time for a hot bath and slow movement in the mornings to lessen your pain, I would go to bed earlier and get up earlier. If the hot bath and slow going does not decrease the pain enough and you still cannot function, then I would add other meds or therapies. Only after trying all kinds of other comprehensive therapies would I even consider surgery. I would see a neurologist and find out what you can do for yourself in conjunction with medications, but not injections. There are other meds besides opiates/narcotics that you can try. There are other non-drug therapies also. Or you may have to look into other kinds of jobs. I would change jobs before I would have additional spinal surgery, but that is just my opinion. Charles has a long history of back problems and experience in all kinds of surgery and treatments, perhaps he will respond. Take care, Annette""This is a question to ask the nurse or doctor that does the procedure. Perhaps she needs a stronger pain med or perhaps she needs to take more than one vicodin before the procedure. Discuss this with the person doing the procedure, then with the doctor prescribing the medication. She should not change the meds with out the prescribing doctors permission. Take care, Annette""I would ask for a referral to a different type of pain management doctor to manage your pain. Ortho docs are not trained to manage chronic pain, just the acute pain from surgery. There are two types of pain management doctors, one kind, called interventionists, does injections and procedures and the other kind does those, and also does a variety of other therapies and oral medications in addition to the injections. Discuss what kinds of therapies the doctor does before making an appt. I cannot respond to the knee flexion/extension problem, I have never had knee surgery and don<APO>t know how long it takes after surgery to gain what kind of extension. Have you also posted on the joint replacement exchange? Take care, Annette""You might take your husband or a friend with you to the doctor<APO>s appt. Have that person visibly taking notes for you. This often makes a doctor sit down and explain things better. Write down your questions before you go, and refer to the list as you talk to him. Do not get up until you have had your partner write down all the answers and YOU understand them. Explain to the doctor/surgeon that you did not understand the answers that were given to you previously. You didn<APO>t say when in <APO>09 you had your surgery. Some pain is common for up to a year after surgery. I had three benign tumors removed along with my right ovary and tube, and it was well over a year before I was pain free. I had no pain before surgery, they were discovered when they went in to tie my tubes with an endoscope. I hemorrhaged in the recovery room after just the scope was done, and I ended up having an open surgery to remove the tumors and stop the bleeding. Take care, Annette""The ondanseton you mentioned is not for pain, it is for nausea and vomiting, it is not a steroid of any kind. I don<APO>t see your doctor as blowing it off, she did blood work and a CT scan. If they did the CT of his entire abdomen, like they usually do it should show pretty much any kind of structural problem in the abdomen. There is no such thing as the stomach flu, the flu is a respiratory illness, stomach flu is an old fashioned term for what is actually a viral problem in the GI tract. Yes, it is important that your husband let his doctor know that he had some kind of gastrointestinal problem the week before he started with this problem. Pancreatitis is a dangerous illness, so it makes sense to me that she wanted to check him out for that right away. He needs to do what the doctors tell him about eating, if they say stick to liquids, he needs to stick to liquids, there are specific reasons why doctors tell us not to eat solid food. I can<APO>t tell you what is wrong with him, if your gut feeling is that there is something more going on and he just is not getting better like you think he should, call the doctor and say so. Take care, Annette""The only thing that helped me was eliminating caffeine from my diet, that really helped with irritable bladder symptoms. I never found any herbal remedies or special diets that helped with reducing pain. Take care, Annette""Anyone with anew or different kind of headache than usual needs to get it checked out by a doctor to make certain nothing dangerous is happening. Please see someone right away. Take care, Annette""When a doctor does a lot of tests and tells you that nothing is wrong, he means that the tests came back negative, you may still be sick with something that he has not tested for. FMS has no blood test or xray to prove you have it. I recommend you visit, http://www.myalgia.com to learn more about FMS. Caffeine can help migraines, I used to take it in emergencies when I was driving and did not want to take anything that would cause sedation. I took caffeine with aspirin. Sometimes it worked. It didn<APO>t make any difference with my FMS, with some people it might, and others it may not. Do not take too much inbuprofen if you have had ulcers in the past. Do not stay in bed, that does not help FMS pain, it makes it worse. Find a primary care doctor at a local free clinic. Call Goodwill, Salvation Army, Catholic Charities, etc. and ask them if there are any free or low cost clinics in your area. Or you can put ""Free clinic in (your area)"" in Google and do a search there. I have gotten 95% of my care through my pcp for the last 50 years. Take care, Annette""You need to see your doctor and get a proper exam and possibly an xray or other imaging test. I would stop pitching/throwing until you know what is going on. If your pcp can<APO>t deal with this then I would see a sports medicine doctor. Take care, Annette ps...if you are underage, tell your parents.""Pain Management: Member Discussion is fine with me. That tells the reader what we discuss, and that it is a members group rather than a group with a resident expert. I do not want support group as part of the name, because then it may end up like the other support groups have here. I prefer that we focus mostly on information rather than social chatting, like some of the support groups have ended up doing. The occasional social thing is fine, but when it gets to where you have to search for the discussions related to the topic it gets tiresome. That is just my preference, may not be every ones. Take care, Annette""Hi, Caprice It is not always about just time, which IS precious to many people. I have only limited ability to be on line posting and reading posts due to pain and fatigue issues. When a board is labeled a support board, like the present FMS Board (and also from what Charles says the Back Board, though I don<APO>t have personal experience with that one), and ends up to be mostly chit chat about social stuff or non-related topics it becomes very difficult to wade through all that looking for medically appropriate issues. I have over a weeks worth of email digests (once per day) from the FMS Support Board sitting on my computer simply due to my own lack of ability to wade through all the posts. I occasionally simple delete them without having read them. This is a disservice to both myself and to anyone else who is trying to get medical information about FMS. We used to have one FMS board for ""support"" and one for medical research and treatment topics for FMS. It was when you eliminated the latter that I had to use the support board exclusively for FMS issues. It doesn<APO>t work well for finding medical related topics. I have repeated asked people to use the headings to designate medical related topics but due to the nature of that board, people do not always do that. I personally don<APO>t use chat rooms for anything, and I think having one board for support type messages including all the social stuff is fine. But please continue to give those of us who want a board to mostly share information a place to be also. I would not even be writing about this if the FMS Reseach and Treatment Board had not been canceled when the expert left. Whenever WebMD starts making changes that they feel will improve things, it makes me nervous. Maybe because they don<APO>t often improve things, or maybe because I don<APO>t like change. There are arguments for both, lol. Take care, Annette""I am sorry, I don<APO>t have any research links for you on this, I think Charles does though. I don<APO>t know if comparative data has been collected on SCS and long term opiate therapy to see which works best in a given set of subjects. I know that for me, the opiates and other non-invasive treatments are best for me at this time. When they stop working, I will check out what else is available and do the research. I have heard of hyper-algesia due to opiates, but I read it is a very rare thing. Like addiction, I don<APO>t particularly worry about it. You say this is a pain pyschologist who you were referred to for training in cognitive therapy. I would remind him that he is seeing you for that alone. Tell him you have a pain management MD and are not looking for another one. If he continues to push the SCS with a new PM doc, I would ask your doc for another referral and tell him why. Then you can stop seeing this guy and change to a new one. Once you get past all this silliness with him and convince him you are sticking with your present plan, he may settle down and work out fine. Take care, Annette""Hi, Charles Just wanted to tell you that you have been missed and I am glad to see you back again. Take care, Annette""I am sure Charles will respond. I just wanted to say that it sounds like you are making progress. You are off the methadone, now you and your doctor can adjust the patch to the right dose for your pain, and add break through meds for the hard times. Take care, Annette""I agree with you. I give doctors of all types three visits to get to know each other. 99% of the time it has worked out fine as we adjust to each other. If you decide not to, or if he does not work out for you, or even in addition to seeing him, I strongly recommend the book, ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns, MD. It is a self help book made to be used with or without a therapist. My therapist gave it to me when I moved away to another state. It was the best present anyone ever gave me. I read it from cover to cover, then went back and picked out the parts that called to me. I learned the techniques and use them to this day, it has been about 15 years now. It even has worksheets that you can use to track your progress. It is a good read, even if you never go back and reread it later. Another good book is ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"", by Dr. Margaret A. Caudill, MD, PhD. It also has worksheets you can use to track your progress. Take care, Annette""There is no way anyone can diagnose you on line as I am sure you already know. Please find a free or low cost clinic in your area and see a doctor. Try calling Goodwill, Salvation Army, or Catholic Charities, or just Google ""free clinics in (your area)"" and see what you can find. The health care bill does not really help most adults right away, it will be 2014 before many of the things even take effect. If you are under 26 and have parents with health insurance, you may qualify to be added to their policy even though you are over 18. That is one new thing that takes effect sooner than 2014. You still have to pay the premiums for that policy. The health plan that was passed was not to just give affordable health care from the government to the people who need it. It forces folks to get insurance, and subsidizes some people. More people will be eligible for Medicaid too. It is long and complicated, but it is mostly about getting people insured by private insurers. I am not sure how it will all come about. We will have to wait and see as different parts of the bill are implemented over time. Take care, Annette""I would try all the possible oral meds before getting an SCS implanted in your back. There is also a long acting Opana, and levorphanol for long acting meds. Or I would try the long acting oxycodone with a breakthrough med. You may still go through side effects like sweating for awhile. That is a common side effect of opiates as you have already found out. Best of luck to you""I can<APO>t say for certain that the opiates cause the sweating problem for you, but it is a common side effect of opiates. I went through that about ten years ago, all I can say is that for me, it finally passed. I was no longer working, but was doing volunteer work, I was terrified that I would get all sweaty and have to change shirts during a shift. I brought an extra just in case and kept it in the car. But, I never did have to go and change. Bless you for teaching in a public high school, that is a real commitment. What subject do you teach? Take care, Annette""I have not gone to any implanted devices yet. I totally agree with you that we all need to accept that we will always have a certain amount of residual pain, no matter what we use to relieve it. I learned cognitive behavioural therapy techniques that have really helped me learn to cope with chronic pain. Take care, Annette""Welcome to all of you. We need medical experts. I went and read your bios and see you are all internists, but that none of you have pain management training or experience noted as part of your bios. I encourage you to read up if necessary, lol, we need you here. I will look forward to seeing you all here. Take care, Annette""What did the doctor say would be the next step if you had no relief from the hip injection? Since that did not help, does he rule out a hip problem? Do you now go on to the back and see if the problem is there? I would pick a doctor that you feel good about, and stick with him/her. Go systematically and figure out what you can rule out completely. Go from there. Somethings do not always show up on MRIs, you can have back pain with a normal MRI. I would not try and diagnose you here, that is just crazy, lol. I would avoid a chiropractor until you have a definite diagnosis and an MD or DO tells you it is safe to go to a chiropractor for adjustments. If you want doctors names, we are not allowed to post them here. If you wish to post an email address, I would get a throw away email account for on line communications (other than with your family and friends). One from Yahoo or Hot Mail maybe. Post that along with your area and request doctors names that way. Someone can email you there with any suggestions and your personal email address is kept safe from spam and stuff like that. Best of luck. Take care, Annette""If you liked that doctor, then I would make an appt. to go see him to figure out where to go next. Few doctors actually call us back to see if an injection relieved our pain, although some do. Make a list of your concerns and take it with you to the appt. Go carefully down the list and ask him about each thing. Write down the answers, most of us do not remember things later due to feeling anxious and nervous during the appt. If you want to take a friend or family member to write down things for you. Best of luck. Take care, Annette""Do you take the Seroquil only when you feel you need it, or is it an everyday on a set schedule thing? Doxycycline is an antibiotic, Migranol is a migraine rescue med, and Medrol is a steroid. I am not sure why you are taking the doxycycline, but the others make sense to me. The steroids helped me when I had unremitting migraines every day for a couple of months years ago. I would ask your pharmacist if the Migranol can cause rebound headaches? I have had this drug IV in the ER, but not at home. Chronic daily headaches are often a form of rebound headaches that can be caused by many different kinds of medicines one uses for migraine rescue. Things like ibuprofen and aspirin, or tylenol are common causes, but other drugs gotten by RX can also cause rebounds. Evan the triptan type migraine rescue meds can cause rebound headaches if taken too often. Since these headaches only started in October, about five and a half months ago, I am pretty sure you have not yet tried all the preventative meds available. Many of them must be taken for 3-4 weeks to get maximum effect, and that would only have given you time to try about 6 of them. It took me over a year to try all the preventatives that I tried at one point in my headache history. I didn<APO>t even go to the next step which is to try them in pairs, until you go through all the possible combinations. I only worked on single preventatives and various rescue meds. I finally read that I should never use a rescue med more than three times in one week to avoid the rebound headaches. To do that I found three different drug rescue treatments, (either singles or combinations) that I could take at home. I experiemented with these until I found the right ones for me. I still use them when needed, but never use one drug more than three times a week. I was having four to five migraines a week at that point. I finally found a drug that works as a preventative that I started for another condition, and found it also worked for my migraines. I keep the rescue meds on hand to use as needed. Keep trying different meds, and combinations of meds, you will find the combo that works for you. I highly recommend keeping a headache journal, with the days you get headaches, the time they start and end, the times you take all your meds, and the result of any rescue meds. Also write down everything you eat and drink, and the times you sleep and wake up, as that can affect headaches. Often over time you will see patterns develop and you may find triggers that you didn<APO>t see before, you will also be able to tell how well your meds are working and may be able to tweak the meds the times or the doses to make them work better. If you feel after a few months that your present doctor is not working for you, try a headache clinic that specializes in headaches for a consultation at least. Somewhere like the Diamond Clinic for headaches or a university teaching hospital that has a headache clinic. I went to one at UCSF in San Francisco. The neurologist I saw there as a consultant was very good and very reassuring to me and my doc back home in Reno, NV. We were on the right treatment path, and he assured us to just kep at it. Take care, Annette""It sounds like you have been through it all. I got on SSDI for migraines and FMS, it took about 14 months total. I found out that once I got on SSDI, it paid too much for me to qualify for Medicaid in my state. I could get Medicare though. Thank God, my husband was still able to work and he covered our health insurance until he retired last year. Now we are both on Medicare. It is tough to find doctors willing to accept Medicare and Medicaid. I am glad to have my pcp already and she was willing to just change me over from the private insurance to Medicare. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""You need to see a doctor and give him a complete history of your injury and any back pain you have had over the years. Look for a free clinic or one with a sliding scale for cost/payment. Call Goodwill, Salvation Army, Catholic Charities, your county medical clinic, etc. They may know of clinics in your area. You can also Google by putting ""free clinics in (your area)"" in their search box and see what comes up. Take care, Annette""Yes. Once he makes a diagnoses, you can start doing what he says to get well and decrease the pain. Meanwhile, I would elevate and ice it. Keep it higher than your heart, and put an ice bag or a bag of frozen vegetables over a towel or washcloth to protect your skin. This should help with the swelling and pain somewhat. Sounds painful, see the doctor. Take care, Annette""Welcome to the exchange. It will be nice having some doctors to provide input. Take care, Annette""Try asking them for information about a pediatric pain management specialist. Some family practice doctors manage kids with pain issues too. Pediatricians can prescribe opioids for pain if they feel they are appropriate. My nephew had orthopedic surgery when he was 8 and pediatric pain management teams managed his pain and that included opiates both in the hospital and at home afterwards. Good luck to you. Take care, Annette""I haven<APO>t had that problem, but I am at a lower dose than that. Lowering of libido was a big problem for methadone patients of mine when I was a RN. A lot of patients requested a lower dose to overcome this problem. It can happen with other opioids, but seems to be a bigger problem with methadone. Take care, Annette""No one on line can diagnose your headache. Go to a doctor and get a proper exam and evaluation. Take care, Annette""There are about 100 different types of arthritis illnesses, there are not blood tests for all of them. There is NO blood test for fibromyalgia. It sounds like perhaps this doctor is not really interested in finding out exactly what is bothering you. If your insurance allows, I would go see a rheumatologist that treats FMS patients as well as arthritis patients. If you must get a referral ask your pcp for one. For information about FMS, I would go to http://www.myalgia.com, it is my favorite resource. Take care, Annette""I agree that listening to patients is the first and best thing any doctor can do. I look for that in a doctor first, I have a doctor that listens, examines, then orders tests if I want them. Then gives me her opinion, if she feels it isout of her league, she finds the right expert for me. However, you have to accept that you may not find a cure for your pain. You may have to take medicine to decrease your pain enough to function. Opiates have the potential for addiction, but only 5% of patients who use them become addicted to them. If you have never been a substance abuser and have no history of addiction in your immediate family, addiction is a remote possibility. That of course, is your decision. Lyrica is nearly the same as neurontin,, if one didn<APO>t work, I would probably not have much faith in the other helping. You might try the antidepressants. Cymbalta is the newer one, but there are a variety of older ones that you might try. Effexor is similar to Cymbalta, and older and probably cheaper. I would not bother with injections, but if you do and they work, great. If you don<APO>t have any faith in them working, you are free to say no. Get a second opinion before doing anything drastic. Tell that doctor that you are only getting a second opinion and you will not be having him do any surgery, injections, etc., you just want his opinion. Do not see anyone in the same group as your present doctor, you would want someone well respected in your community, but fresh eyes and ears. If it turns out you like that guy better, you can always change doctors, but don<APO>t tell him that up front. Take care, Annette""I did read the article, thank you for posting it. It included withdrawal processes from a variety of drugs, including alcohol. I read the parts under opiate withdrawals, they included the following, ""In general, opioid withdrawal does not directly cause life threatening symptoms like seizures or delerium."" and ""... seizures which are characteristic of DT, are not seen in opiate withdrawal."" Part of the article did state that although it is usually possible to get info about the total dose and last dose of opiate, it is often difficult to find out about other medical problems the person may have. I did not read past the section about opiate withdrawals. I did bookmark it, so I will go back later and read more. Thanks again. Take care, Annette""I read more. The last part under ""Medicolegal Pitfalls"" discusses seizures in opiate withdrawal as follows, ""Seizures are not a part of the clinical picture of opiate withdrawals, except in neonates, in whom seizures may occur."" This article is also very clear that DTs are something that occurs in alcohol withdrawal not opiate withdrawal. Take care, Annette""Tramadol is not considered an opiate class drug, it is a drug in its own class that does act weakly on the opiate receptors of the brain. It is not even a controlled substance on the drug schedules. It also lowers the seizure threshold, so seizures are associated with its use. It is often used in FMS because it seems to give folks with FMS increased energy when it is used on a set schedule several times a day. It is often not used at night because of this effect, it keeps people awake. This is anecdotal info found when folks with FMS used the drug. I like Medscape, I use it a lot for research into various medical topics. Take care, Annette""Where does a nurse get her/his knowledge base to begin with but medical research? Of course, one also uses one<APO>s own personal experience with patients. I have been a registered nurse for 39 1/2 years, and worked for all but a few years of that time, either paid or volunteer. I have seen plenty of opiate overdoses causing death, but never a single death due to opiate withdrawal. I am personally on daily opiate therapy, and I have no other medical conditions in addition to the chronic pain conditions of FMS, DDD, and migraines. None of those would cause any problem if I had to withdraw from the opiates. I don<APO>t think I am so unusual. There are a lot of folks here that use opiates that do not have medical conditions that would complicate coming off of opiates. Scaring people by saying that they will likely have seizures as the first sign of withdrawal from opiates is a wrong thing to do. Their doctors should give them adequate information and they should also seek out other information from medical research before starting any therapy. That is informed consent. Have you posted any medical sites that say that seizures and/or death is a likely outcome of opiare withdrawal? Take care, Annette""You should relate these effects to the doctor who was originally prescribing this drug to you when he returns home. Aside from questions about how it affects your blood pressure and pulse, which are now coming down now that you are back on it, this drug can cause rebound headaches if taken too frequently. I would question taking any rescue med more than three days per week. This was a commonly given drug for migraines many years ago, but not so much anymore unless it is taken rather infrequently. Anyone who gets migraines more than three times a month should be on preventatives along with their rescue meds according to the neurologists and pcps that saw me about my migraines over the years. If you are not on a preventative and/or find yourself taking Fioricet with codeine most days, I would re-evaluate your migraine treatment plan. Take care, Annette""I am glad that your current regimen is keeping you out of the ER and that you are doing well. Everyone has their own issues and health problems, using the med like you are for BT pain while on fentanyl patches is far different from someone who is not on all those other meds and using them as needed for migraines. Even people with just migraines may try all the other meds and find that fioricet with codeine works best for them. I meant to say they are no longer the first line medicine for migraines, if I did not make that clear I apologize. Everyone should discuss their care with their doctor and do research on their own, and make their own decision about their care. I finally found the right combination both for my migraines and for my other chronic pain also. I have not been in the ER as a patient for early 15 years. I am sure you hated as much as I did the path to finding the right combination of meds. I am glad we are both at the end of that road. Take care, Annette""I am not sure what kind of treatment the spine place suggested. I too had all kind of spurs, arthritis, and DDD in my neck region. I had one herniated disc removed in 1992, and had a second one herniate after I was rear ended at a stop sign. I let the second one heal on its own and it did after about 18 months. There was no difference in my migraines with the surgery, I would not recommend surgery to anyone as a fix for migraines. I think medicines are the best bet in most cases. My pcp has pretty much always managed my migraine meds. I saw a couple of neurologists over the years, but just as a consult, not for regular treatment. The best medicine for migraines is not anything that has opiates or barbiturates in it. Those are older drugs that were used back when we did not know anything about migraines. They basically put the patient to sleep so you could sleep off the headache. There are meds now that we can take that do not include sedation, so we can continue to function on them. The treatment for migraines has come a long, long way since I first had one at age 35. I am 59 now. Take care, Annette""Why would the doctor give her a back brace? Does she have something else going on also? Has she had the test done to show she has osteoporosis? Where is her current pain? Does it go on all the time, or come and go? Where would she put it on a 0-10 scale, 10 being the worst pain, and 0 being no pain? Those are the kinds of questions a doctor will ask her about the pain. He will probably ask her many more. She should have a list of her own concerns. Maybe you could go with her and help her take notes. She is lucky to have a daughter like you. Take care, Annette""You need to go and be examined by a doctor to figure out what is going on. Once you get some idea what is happening, come back and tell us about it, and perhaps someone who has something similar will have some suggestions for you. Take care, Annette PS...You have discussed this with your parents haven<APO>t you? What suggestions did they make?""If you had said it hurts to walk around at school, I would have been more worried about you being a hypochodriac, lol. The fact that it hurts when you are doing something that is enjoyable for most kids makes me believe you. Because you are 16, in most states you have to have your parents<APO> consent to be treated for non-reproductive health concerns. If you live in Oregon the age of consent for any medical treatment is only 15. All I can suggest is to just keep telling your parents that it hurts and when and how much. I wish I could help you more. Take care, Annette""Painful feet were one of the first symptoms of FMS that I had. I was working full time in the ER and the tops of my feet especially would just hurt so much, I would cry all the way home after work, then wipe my face and go take a hot bath. I tried different shoes, and all but nothing really helped. The pain finally migrated elsewhere, but comes back occasionally to my feet. Take care, Annette""I have bad DDD in my neck with multiple herniated discs. Heat, ice, and home traction were the best things for the pain I had in my neck. Medications helped too. I tried traction at PT first, when it worked, then the doctor prescribed me a home unit. I have used it on and off for many years. Discuss this with your doctor and see what suggestions he has. Take care, Annette""It hung on the top of the door, with a foam head piece that fit over my head around my neck, and a rope went up to the top of the door, through a pulley and down to a plastic bag of water. The doc told me how much water to add and how long I was to use it. it only cost $20, but that was many years ago, 1991, I think. I got it from a medical supply house with a RX from the doc. If you are talking about a foam or a hard collar that you just wear to take the pressure off your neck, I would not use it, especially without discussing it with your doctor first. My neurosurgeon was really against using any collar except after disc surgery (and then for a very limited amount of time). My pcp agreed. They both said it would weaken the neck muscles and make my problems worse. I think it was good to try it out at PT first to see if it even helped before I bought it. Do your shoulder muscles feel really tight all the time? That is another thing that PT can help with. If you can loosen them up it really helps with pain. Take care, Annette""I am curious if you have tried any of the prescription topical anti-inflammatories that have become available recently? They are not supposed to bother the GI tract, but they are still supposed to work for pain and inflammation. I am lucky that ibuprofen works well for me for certain kinds of pain and does not bother my GI tract so far. I am always looking to the future though. Take care, Annette""I would suggest two books, ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns, MD, and ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You""by Dr. Margaret A. Caudill, MD, PhD. Both books have worksheets you can use to chart your progress. These books can be used with or without a therapist. Therapy is something to think about too. The good therapists often use cognitive behavioural therapy techniques to help you feel better and work on the depression and feelings of worthlessness. I also started with my neck problems in my 30s, except my doctor told me I had the neck of a 90 year old, lol. I had surgery on a herniated disc in my cervical spine in 1992, I was losing function in my right (dominant) hand and was dropping things. That was fixed by the surgery. Six months later I was rear ended at a stop sign and herniated the disc above the surgical site. I let that one heal on its own without surgery. I developed other chronic pain conditions and lost my job also. I do have my husband though, it took him awhile to learn about my health issues, but he did. Give your husband a little time, guys seem to want to fix things for us, and this may be something that cannot be fixed. He needs to learn to live with it, and that is tough. No one wants to see their loved one in pain day in, and day out. It is a great suggestion to take him with you to the doctor<APO>s appt. You will get through it. You can learn to be happy and useful in spite of the chronic pain. Take care, Annette""Well said, BrenBren. I hope your day does turn into something positive, I am certain you can make it so. I think it is fine to disagree here. I don<APO>t get angry about things on line, life is too short. Hugs, Annette""I hope Charles replies soon. He is certainly the one here with the most personal experience with fentanyl patches. According to my drug handbook there are MANY medicines that can interfere with how the fentanyl works in the body, the temperature of the body also affects absorption. Certainly how well the patch sticks on your skin affects absorption. I don<APO>t have a scientific answer for you, but I am glad since you had so much trouble with it, that you are moving on to another pain medication. Take care, Annette""I would not recommend you play phone tag with the doctor. This is an important problem and I would make an appt. to see him in person and discuss this with him face to face. Tell the person answering the phone that this is an emergency situation. If you applied your last patch tonight, he needs to see you within a couple of days. I have not used that patch, but I did use an estrogen patch that would not stick, and my doctor and the pharmacist suggested I apply a tegaderm patch over the other one. Tegaderm is a brand name for a clear dressing cover. If you ask your pharmacist, he should be able to steer you to it at the dressing section of the drug store. They are a little pricey, and the company that makes your patches may have covers that they will provide for you for free, call and ask the manufacturer. Take care, Annette""I strongly suggest two books, the first is ""Feeling Good"". by Dr. David Burns, MD. The second is ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"", by Dr. Margaret A. Caudill, MD, PhD. The first is a book that was written mainly for depression and anxiety, it uses cognitive behavioural therapy techniques that I found very helpful for pain management also. It has worksheets that you can use to evaluate where you are and track your progress. The second is a book that is good for anyone with chronic pain, no matter what the cause is. It also has worksheets that you can tear out and copy to track your progress. I think the worksheets are important to use until you feel confidant about self evaluation. The worksheets are far easier to use than trying to remember how you felt last week and if you feel better this week. I found using both these books along with the medication my doctor prescribed worked wonders on my spirit and way of thinking in general. Take care, Annette""I think I would pass on any more injections. I would tell the doctor that I have tried two different kinds of injections, and neither helped, and I want to just stick to meds, and see what else he suggests. Take care, Annette""Lisa, Let us know how the EMG goes on Thursday. I had one that didn<APO>t hurt at all, and one that did hurt some. The results were the same though. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Best of luck to you. Getting an EMG done will help you and your doctor figure out what is going on with your nerves. When do you see him again? Take care, Annette""BrenBren made great suggestions, I really do not have much to add. You might apply for Headstart programs in your area. Where I lived 25 years ago, there was only one preschool, the Headstart one. My son got in fairly quickly, and it was FREE, even though I could afford to pay, they don<APO>t allow it. My sister<APO>s son also attended Headstart many years later after my son was grown up. It is a great program, they fed them breakfast and lunch, and had lots of good learning in between. Applying for SSDI can take a long time, so go ahead and apply as soon as possible. I would see a lawyer who has experience in SSDI as early in the process as possible. They know how to word the responses to their questions correctly. Also, if you wait too long and have not worked and paid into it, you lose your eligibility. Go to their website at ssa.gov and do some reading there. It is a very user friendly site. Take care, Annette""You need to go see your doctor and get re-evaluated. He should be able to make some kind of assessment and then you can stop worrying about it and do some thing about it. There are other things it could be besides the ones you are worrying about. There are nerves that run through your buttocks and down your leg. They could be pinched or irritated. It could be something as simple as that. Take care, Annette""Hi, Christina You have a multitude of problems, they may all be contributing to these problems in your hands/arms. FMS and many kinds of spinal problems in your neck can cause problems in your arms/hands. Your doc eliminated CT, now he has to work his way up your arms to your neck and see what else it might be. Take care, Annette""Hi, Brenbren I suggest you go to http://www.myalgia.com for lots of good info about fibromyalgia. It is not an interactive site, like this one, but it does have lots of good articles about the diagnosis and treatment of FMS. Read up there and see what you find, and if it is similar to what you are experiencing. My vit. D level was just a little bit low, so I have been taking daily supplements for quite awhile now, I don<APO>t really notice any improvement in my symptoms, but it is better for my body, so I keep taking it. Take care, Annette""You need to go see a doctor and get a proper diagnosis. Don<APO>t take tylenol or advil or any over the counter med for more than a few weeks without medical advice. Take care, Annette""What was your diagnosis when you left the hospital after passing out? Has anyone checked you for an inner ear problem? Your complaint of dizziness and vomiting and symptoms of motion sickness suggest perhaps you had a form of vertigo. Inner ear infections can cause those symptoms. You also mentioned that you are taking something for your headache every morning to prevent it from turning into a migraine. Later you mentioned taking a Norco first thing in the AM. Norcos are short acting hydrocodone/APAP, taking them daily can cause rebound headaches, making your problems with migraines worse, not better. Anyone who is getting more than three headaches per month needs to be evaluated by a headache specialist and should probably try a preventative med in addition to rescue meds. I have had migraines that were very much like having a stroke. You need a full evaluation by a specialist to figure out just what is going on. You can certainly have more than one thing going on at the same time. I would see a neurologist. I would not suggest you drive until this is all figured out. Take care, Annette""What level of your cervical spine was operated on? Where is your pain? You did not say neck pain, you said back pain? Did they take bone from your hip for the fusion? It takes a long time to recover from spinal surgery. You certainly won<APO>t be healed within three weeks. It will take about three months for most people to even return to work, and a full year for complete healing. You really should have discussed this all with your surgeon before the operation, what did he say? Take care, Annette""I had anterior discectomy at level C5-6 in 1992. I had it for functional deficits, not for pain, and it did work for that. Because I did not have a fusion done, I was allowed to go back to work as a night shift RN in the ER after 6 weeks with no restrictions. My neurosurgeon told me the surgical fusion would have had me off work for 12 weeks, and the added risk was minimal for me with the surgery that I ended up having. It fused on its own in about 5 months which was what the doctor expected. During that time I had minimal risk of the two vertebrae not fusing as planned. I was not allowed to ride my horses during that time. I thought it was a good sign that the doctor explained both options to me and let me participate in the decision on which surgery I would have. I would discuss the pain you are having with your surgeon, and perhaps ask about having some PT. You may have back pain due to the position you were in during surgery, or from self positioning since surgery. Sometimes we avoid certain positions to avoid pain in our necks where we had surgery, and that can cause pain in other parts of our bodies. Spinal surgery for pain should always be the last option after trying everything else possible, as it often does not work well. It works better for functional deficits. Take care, Annette""Adding an antidepressant is common for any pain management program, including one for degenerative disc disease. The antidepressant increases the blood level of serotonin, a mood elevator. It is a neurotransmitter that also is involved in the sending and receiving of pain messages. Because it works in both ways it seems to help many people. Another adjuvant medication to try may be one of the antiseizure meds. They also work well for pain management in many patients. I use gabapentin and have for about ten years now. It does lower my pain levels a bit more in conjunction with my other meds. Tramadol is about the strongest non-opiate pain med available. Nucynta is a new pain management drug that has come out recently. It has mixed reviews. It is too new for me to be willing to try. I wait five years after a drug is widely prescribed and then read the studies and see how well it is being accepted. Talk to your doctor about what is available, what you have already tried and how well it worked. Often just a tweaking of the doses and perhaps adding a non-opiate drug can really enhance your level of relief. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t think it is that the antidepressants will work well for pain on their own, they are used as a cocktail along with other meds for pain. I think they keep the pain levels down some while using them with opiates and other drugs. It is all about using whatever tools we can to try and keep our opiate levels as low as possible for as long as possible. Take care, Annette""Sorry, Skrappy, I misunderstood too. That is one of the problems with posting, things are not always clear to one another at first. As we get to know each other better, there won<APO>t be as many misunderstandings. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know that you need an MRI. I would perhaps see an orthopedic surgeon if my pcp could not figure it out. Have you tried avoiding the exercise for awhile, or using ice or heat or anti-inflammatories? What did your doctor suggest you do while you wait to see a specialist? Did he give you even a tentative diagnosis? Take care, Annette""Hi, Brenbren I am always up at this hour, lol. I am so sorry, I cannot remember what your dose was on the patch. However, it is fine to replace the patch with oxycodone or some other opiate. There are charts and tools available to figure out the ball park dose that is equianalgesic, that is would deliver the same amount of relief for most people. I know everyone hates it when I quote books and research, but from what I have read, you can decrease your opiates by about 50% and you should have much increased pain, but not overt withdrawal symptoms. This has also been my personal experience while taking opiates. The problem with that is there really is no way to tell in advance how much partial tolerance YOU have going from one opiate to another. Most of the references I have read say to start a new opiate at 50% of the equianalgesic dose to prevent an overdose situation, then use BT meds as needed while one adjusts the dose of the long acting med until you reach the right level. This is the time to work very closely with your doctor. I have only personally changed long acting opiates one time in eleven years. That was very recently. I stopped the original med, and started the new one on the same day. My BT meds remained the same. My doctor worked out a plan with me, because I believe in starting low and going up slowly. I want to stay at as low a dose as possible for as long as possible. She was much more generous with dosing than I wished to take. So I started with about a third of the dose she suggested, and used my BT meds. Then I increased my dose of long acting meds once a week until I felt okay with the dose and the relief I was getting. The last increase I made was to take a third dose a day, rather than increasing the amount per dose. I felt I got better relief that way and she was fine with me taking it every 8 hours instead of every 12 hours. I did not have any withdrawal symptoms, but did have hugely increased pain at first, which I treated with BT meds until I got my long acting dose up to the right level. She had me call her on the phone as needed during this time. This is only the second time in ten years that I have discussed meds with her on the phone, rather than seeing her in person. She asked me to call her. I believe that her generous RX for BT meds made this whole process easy. It may well be a real drag for the next week or so, but keep in close contact with your doctor (no phone tag with a third party in the middle). It is best to see him in person, but talking to HIM on the phone is okay. You should get through this changeover and do fine on the new drugs. Take care, Annette""Fentanyl is available in lozenges or lollypops. You place these in the side of your mouth between your cheek and your gums, and the medicine is absorbed through the mucous membrane of your mouth. It is almost as fast acting as taking fentanyl IV, but it is very short acting also. This delivery system was designed for cancer patients and many insurance companies do not pay for them when used by non-malignant chronic pain patients. I would check with your insurance comapny before you ask your doctor for a RX for them. They are VERY expensive. I have mixed feelings about using them long term. I really do not think it is a good idea for me personally. Really think about it, and discuss the pros and cons with your doctor if you think that is where you want to go for a break through med. Take care, Annette""I believe in changing form one long acting opiate to another it is all in the dosing. I changed in November-December from one long acting opiate pill to another, and had no withdrawal symptoms at all. I had increased pain while adjusting the dose, but that was it. Perhaps my doctor was more skilled in changing patients from one long acting opiate to another. Take care, Annette""Hi, Bren You did not come across as anything but your usual nice self, but in pain. I may have overstated what seemed obvious to you. I try to give out information as needed to a post, but I also aim at others who may be lurking but too shy to ask a question themselves. If you and I were speaking face to face privately, I am sure things would come out much more clearly for both of us. I don<APO>t like to try and second guess anyone<APO>s doctor. I do not know what is in their head, what they need to look up, or ask someone else, etc. I do know that you are suffering far too much for anyone who is trying to change from one med to another. I am very blessed in my doctor I know that, I hope you and your present doctor or any new doctor you opt to go to will find the same kind of relationship. It takes time, but it is possible. I responded to this post last night, and for some reason it was deleted. I mentioned that it would not hurt if you told the doctor you used to work in rehab/nursing, because I thought you meant you had done so. Now I am accused of telling you to lie to your doctor. I did not mean for you to do that of course. If you never did work in rehab/nursing, I would not suggest you lie and say you had. Doctors can usually figure it out and you would not gain any respect. You don<APO>t need to lie. I respect you, and see no reason a doctor would not. Hugs, Annette""Generics are regulated by the FDA. They are required to have the SAME amount of active drug as the brand name drug, and it has to be released in the same time frame. If fentanyl wasn<APO>t regulated people would die or end up very sick. You can go to the FDA website and read their regulations about generics drugs. I did, just to see if what I had read here and on other sites was accurate. It sure did not seem to be. Take care, Annette""I do not know just what you are asking about the fentanyl lollipops/lozenges? Where you ""might find such objects""...the pharmacy. If this is in response to my comments about generics, I don<APO>t know if these meds are available in generics, I am pretty sure the fentanyl lozenges are not available in generic, I do not know about the lollipops with fentanyl. I was responding to your post about fentanyl patches and replying about generics in general. I got the information about generics from the fda.gov website. I am not sure how the fentanyl lollipops/lozenges got into this discussion. Take care, Annette""I agree with you Trudy. It is FDA approved for cancer pain management, and many insurance companies will only cover it for that. Some doctors are willing to prescribe it for chronic non-malignant pain though, and some insurance companies are willing to cover it for that. I think it mainly depends on your doctor and which insurance company you have. Of course if you are willing to just pay cash, you only need your doctor to write the RX. Fentanyl is very short acting when used in these forms, it acts quickly and leaves ones system fairly quickly, about 3-4 hours. Some people say even less. Much of the medical information I have read says that tolerance develops more quickly when one uses short acting opiates than when one uses long acting ones. I would avoid these types of BT meds myself also. But, it is up to each individual I guess. Take care, Annette""Most doctors use break through meds, but the occasional doc would rather you increase your long acting drug until you have pain levels you can manage. I would not specify a drug by name, just tell him the current regimen is not working for you and you are unable to do the activities you like to do and name them. Be a broken record if necessary. Keep repeating yourself until he either increases the dose on your present med, adds a new med, or changes your meds. I believe that by increasing your med to every 8 hours, or by increasing the dose of the med every 12 hours, or adding a breakthrough med, you may not need to change your current med to a different one. Take care, Annette""He needs professional help in his effort to stay clean and sober if that is what he wishes to do. I would suggest he see a pain management doc who works with an addictions specialist. They can together work out a treatment plan for him that addresses both his pain and his prior overuse of the hydrocodone. I am concerned also that the hydrocodone is mixed with tylenol and taking 180 of those pills in 9 days could cause permanent liver damage due to the tylenol overdose. Was he taking that many pills to change how he felt emotionally, to get high or to numb his feelings of depression and stress? Or was he taking it to get rid of undertreated pain? We will never be pain free, but our pain should be doable, we should be able to function in our households and with our families. His depression also needs to be treated properly. Since the question of abuse seems to be coming from him, I feel it would be useful for him to see someone who knows about this problem and how to help him. Please keep in touch. Take care, Annette""If, he has been out of all his pills for seven days, he is past the worst of withdrawal already. If he has only been out of the vicodin for seven days, at least he is off the med containing tylenol. You said he was on oxycodone not percocet, plain oxycodone either short or long acting does not have tylenol in it. Look on the label if it has APAP on it with oxycodone, then discuss this with your husband and his doctor. It should not take the doctor a year to wean him off of any meds he is still on. He may not choose to take him off of all the meds, that would depend on your husband and the recommendation of the addictions specialists too. Why he was taking all those pills is the important thing in deciding these things, Be strong for your hubby, you might see a therapist yourslf. To learn the best way to help him. Take care of youuself""Go see your doctor and get a proper exam and see what is going on. You know we can<APO>t make a diagnosis on line. Once you find out what is going on, you can get on the path to feeling better. Take care, Annette""Unfortunately, it takes more than we can do online to tell if you are having something other than a flare. I usually do all the usual stuff that I do to try and control my pain, then call my doctor to see what she has to offer. Occasionally, I can tell that my pain is not my usual FMS pain, and can go right to my doctor, but often I can<APO>t tell the difference. Another of my doc<APO>s patients called her once for additional pain, and it turned out she had a tumor on her spine. I hate to see anyone put off proper care while they may have something that could be serious. In addition to my vit. D level my doc checks my vit. B12 level. A lower than normal level can cause an increase in pain, especially neurologic pain. My hot tub is the best non-drug pain killer I have. My hubby also rubs my feet and I have found that distracts me from any other pain I may be having. These are just short term helps, but anything is better than nothing. Take care, Annette""Welcome from New Zealand!!! I would love it if you could share any other tips from your pain management course as time goes on. Take care, Annette""You might visit http://www.myalgia.com and do some reading about FMS. They have very good info there. It might give you an idea if that is what you are experiencing. Myofascial Pain Syndrome is different from FMS. Take care, Annette""You know me, I am not one of the doctors here, but perhaps I can shed some light. If you would prefer to wait for a doctor, just don<APO>t bother to read this. There is no perfect answer to this question. First, since you had adhesion problems, you and your doctor may not even know how much of the fentanyl you were getting per hour or per day to begin with. Second, there is a process called partial cross tolerance with opiates. This means that one can develop a tolerance to one opiate, and when they switch to a new one, they will only have a partial tolerance to that one, not the same tolerance level as the old drug. If one took the entire equianalgesic dose of the new drug, one could overdose on it. So the literature suggests starting the new opiate at about 50% of the equianalgesic dose of the old drug. Then you adjust the drug up as necessary to control pain. You can use BT meds to control pain during this process. It is an art not a science to practice medicine. Part of the deal is the doctor knowing you and guessing how you will respond to the drugs. Some doctors are more careful than others. Go and see your doctor face to face as soon as possible to discuss this with him. Take care, Annette""I can<APO>t tell what he was think, if anything. I would call back and tell them it IS an emergency and if the doctor can<APO>t see you, what ER do they wish you to go to. Maybe that will get them moving, if not then I guess you will have to wait until after Easter. Then I think you have the right idea, just show up at the office at opening time and see what he can do for you. I am so sorry you are going through all this. Hugs, Annette""I would call your doctor and ask him what to do. If you have had liver problems in the past that might change things somewhat. A drug allergy causes hives or difficulty breathing. An adverse reaction might be abdominal pain, but I would not assume that the pain is even related to the meds without being checked out by your doctor. What if it is something else going on in your abdomen? Please remember that taking regular and ER is very different, they are not interchangable. Discuss what to do with your doctor should this happen again. Have a plan to prevent it. Perhaps gradually changing the times until you only take them outside of working hours might be one way to handle this. Maybe just before work and after you get home??? Take care, Annette""Hi, Kat I would suggest that you take your list of meds to your pharmacist and ask him if any of them might interact with the fentanyl in any way. If he feels they might, or for a second opinion, take the same list to your doctor and ask him the same question. Because you take a lot of different meds, for your various conditions you may get some of them from different doctors, I don<APO>t know that. Another avenue to take would be to call the maker of the brand of fentanyl you use and ask for the adverse event department, and ask them if any of your other meds could interfere with the fentanyl. I totally understand why you take as much of the opiates as you do. You were on a dose of methadone that needed to be replaced when you changed over to the fentanyl and roxicodone. I don<APO>t think the fentanyl dose is all that high, the roxicodone is at a higher dose for BT meds than many people take, but it is all in balancing the two. Don<APO>t worry about what you take compared to other people. Just worry about controlling your symptoms. Take care, Annette""Swank is correct. Oxycodone is the generic name of the drug in both long and short acting forms. Oxycontin is the brand name of oxycodone in a long acting delivery form. Generic Oxycontin would be called Oxycodone ER (for extended release). Never, ever break, cut or chew Oxycontin or oxycodone ER as it destroys the shell that makes it a long acting drug, and you can get ALL the drug at once instead of over 8-12 hours as intended. This can kill you as Swank said. Take care, Annette""Hi, Shannon I also have FMS. I have been on neurontin for about 11-12 years now. I gradually increased it at first, about 300 mg. per week. It took until I got up to 1800 mg. per day before it worked really well. After a few months on that dose, I gradually decreased it to 800 mg. per day as it seemed to make me kind of lethargic. I have stayed on that dose for many years. I felt somewhat drunk at first after I took the dose near bedtime. I took the entire dose in the evening to avoid sedation during the day. But, after a few weeks on the dose, it stopped giving me any side effects at all. I also use opiates on a daily basis. I take ambien for sleep. I did not tolerate the antidepressants, but many people feel they help them. I don<APO>t think any one drug will fix the pain of FMS. I think that a combination of various meds and non-drug treatments is best for me. I adore my hot tub, and before that I used a hot bath in the tub for a soak before bedtime. You might look at the articles on http://www.myalgia.com for good info about FMS. Take care, Annette""That depends on how much more pain you have. Usually, one continues their chronic opiate treatment and uses extra meds for any acute pain they have from surgery. Are you going to a hospital for the surgery that has a pain management team available for all their surgical patients? Have you discussed with your surgeon and anesthesiologist your usual chronic pain meds and how they will handle any additional pain? My husband had hip replacement surgery in 2008 and had been on pain management with opiates for a couple of years. The pain management team and his surgeon and anesthesiologist handled his pain meds very well. But, we did discuss it all ahead of time. The latest issue of Nursing2010 magazine had an excellent article called ""Managing Pain in Acute Care, Getting It Right"" by Yvonne D<APO>Arcy, MS, CRNP, CNS. You might check their website, www.Nursing2010.com, and see if you can find it. If not let me know. Take care, Annette""Perhaps you have to pay for a subscription to get access, sorry. Basically, the article says that one should continue their long acting meds as usual, if they cannot have anything by mouth for awhile the doctor should administer the meds by IV until the patient can take them by mouth. During the post op time they should give you additional pain meds as needed to cover the postop pain too. The article suggests that many patients will need between a 25 and 50% increase in their daily meds depending on their report of pain severity. It says it is very important that the patient not miss a dose of their long acting opiate prior to surgery as that can cause their pain to get ahead of them, and it may be very difficult to catch up to it. I think the important thing is to have a serious talk with your surgeon prior to surgery. Take care, Annette""I read an interesting bit in my Nursing 2010 magazine this month about a very small study regarding RSD/CRPS. (Gail, I keep an eye out for these articles for you.) They found that an infusion of IV immunoglobulin in a low dose of 0.5 g/kg significantly reduced pain in about half of the 13 patients with RSD participating. The participants had ""refractory, long standing, complex regional pain syndrome."" Relief lasted about 5 weeks and the treatment caused few adverse reactions. This is a very small study group, but it is important that you all know that studies are being done. It is hoped that the next study would be with a higher dose, given repeatedly, to see if there would be even more benefit. I will save the item, and if anyone wants the authors<APO> names and the journal it was originally printed in, I will be happy to post it. Hugs, Annette Hugs, Annette""Thanks for your help, Byroney. I am so glad my hubby managed to keep working until we were both eligible for Medicare. But, there are a lot of things out there to help folks who need it. Take care, Annette""Most states have a high risk pool for folks without insurance. Unfortunately, in many places it costs too much for the folks who need it the most. Thanks for reminding us so folks can go and check. Take care, Annette""If anyone who visits here does not have insurance and cannot afford to go to the doctor for an exam and a diagnosis, many communities have free/low cost clinics and other specialty care. I know because I volunteered in one twice a week for about nine years. I had a hard time finding it because it did not advertise. To find one, I suggest you call Goodwill, Salvation Army, Catholic Charities, or your local health department and ask what is available in your community. You can also use a search engine like Google, I put ""free medical clinic in (the town I was looking in)"" in the search box, and found a number of choices in the towns where I was looking for family members. The organization ""Volunteers in Medicine"" runs clinics in a number of communities. Needymeds.com is a website that one can use to find out what meds are covered by patient assistance programs run by the various drug companies. There are other medication assistance programs available also. This site is great to get supportive information from folks who have similar problems that you do, but it is not the place to get a diagnosis. Only a doctor can do that, and only after actually seeing you in person. NO ONE can make a diagnosis on line without seeing a patient in person. I really believe that the only way to get proper care is to see a doctor as a starting off place. It is fine to use the internet to research a condition once you have been diagnosed, but it is very unwise to try and diagnose yourself based on what you read, or get someone else to diagnose you on line. After you get information online take it to your doctor and discuss it with him/her. Not all info you find on line is accurate or appropriate for your illness. I would suggest one use reliable medical sites for information, not sites that are trying to sell you stuff. I use evidence based medical research when it is available. Sites like Medscape have articles from peer reviewed medical journals. Take care, Annette""I finally found the ACLU under aclu.org. I could not find anything about pain control on their site, but maybe I just don<APO>t know how to look, lol. All I found was a lot of the lawsuits they have filed for various other things, nothing about pain control and the Constitution. Thanks for letting us know more from your point of view. Hope to see you here again. Take care, Annette""I am so sorry you are going through so much right now. I cannot even imagine how difficult it must be for you. Is there any chance your pcp will increase your pain meds over time, or is he one of those who will not prescribe opiates? You are between a rock and a hard place, with your business and your health needs. I wish I had an answer for you. Hugs, Annette""Hi, The way I understand breakthrough meds is that you should only need to take them when your pain spikes out of control due to an activity or something. Once or twice or three times a day maybe. If your pain is always high and you find you always need to take the BT meds to prevent an increase in your regular pain, perhaps it is time to adjust or change your long acting med...I would discuss it with your doc. However, instead of saying you are in pain all the time, you might think about phrasing it in relation to your functional levels. Tell him what activities you would like to do, but cannot do due to your high pain levels. You might keep a pain journal, with pain scores 0-10, the times you take all your meds, etc. Note what activities you can do, and which ones you miss because you don<APO>t feel well enough. Just my suggestions, they work for me. Take care, Annette""I have FMS, but have not had the pain that you describe. That is not unusual though, we all have different kinds of pain in different parts of our bodies. My pain is there all the time, it just varies what part of the body it is in, usually the legs and hips for me. I have found that the information at http://www.myalgia.com is very useful. You might try reading there. See you again soon. Take care, Annette""I have had pain like a severe sunburn on the backs of my knees at times. Also on the outside of my upper arms. Neurontin has mostly gotten rid of this kind of pain. I have taken it for about 10-11 years now. Lidoderm patches also helped, but they are very expensive if your insurance does not cover them. I think FMS is mainly a neurological problem, so this kind of pain does not surprise me. Take care, Annette""Glad to have you aboard. I would be happy to hear more of your suggestions. I agree with your basic tenets. Take care, Annette""My drug handbook lists all opiates as B/D depending on when they are taken in the pregnancy and how high a dose is taken. The very beginning of the pregnancy and close to the end of pregnancy and the higher the dose, the worse it seems to be for the baby. The occasional med during the middle trimester seemed to be okay if really needed. If it has been changed to a C level I would not want to take it at all to prevent harm to my baby. My mom smoked and drank a glass of wine every day during all five of her pregnancies and we all turned out okay, big, robust babies. But we know better now. Mom was probably just lucky and had good genes. I think all meds taken during pregnancy should be on a risk/benefit basis. What other things have you tried non-drug wise to help you sleep? What is causing your pain to begin with? Try the least invasive thing first, and move up to meds depending on what you and your doctor think is best. By the way, congratulations on the new baby!!! Take care, Annette""I have a friend with this condition. She had a variety of lab work done, an ultrsound of the liver, and a liver biopsy. All in addition to a medical history and physical exam of course. She was having abdominal pain from something else. According to my Merck Manual there are many ways to differentiate alcoholic from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease other than the patient saying whether or not he.she drinks. There are various lab tests, and the liver biopsy of course will tell pretty specifically what the problem is. Alcohol is only one of many reasons to have liver disease. They each cause different kinds of changes in the cells of the liver, so a biopsy where they look at the cells under the microscope should be pretty clear. If the patient drinks he should be honest with the doctor. Even if the primary liver problem is non-alcoholic, drinking may effect the eventual outcome. Take care, Annette""Yes, you are right. I miswrote and put Tegaderm instead of Lidoderm. Thanks for the correction. I am rather overweight, and the Lidoderm patches DO help me with leg and hip pain both. Trust me my hips are plenty big enough that I didn<APO>t think the Lidoderm patches would help with pain there, but they do. I only tried them because another chronic pain patient that used to post here said she loved them. My doc gave me some samples, and then I got a RX and got more. Because they are so expensive, I only use them when things really hurt alot, and they do help decrease my pain considerably. Since I changed my long acting pain med, I haven<APO>t needed them but once. Take care, Annette""I use neurontin for pain along with opiates. I have found it helps to lower my pain levels. I also take a RX sleep aid because I have found it almost impossible to cope if I don<APO>t get some sleep. When nerve pain is really bad, especially in my legs/hips, I use Tegaderm patches. They also help, but they are also very expensive if you don<APO>t have insurance to cover them. I have never had any of the injections they do in the spinal area. I have little faith in them working. I have had one injection into my shoulder that did help a lot. I could feel the knot that hurt, and the doctor just injected that spot and the pain went away. She used a combination of a long acting anesthetic and a steroid. Take care, Annette""Thanks, I was named for my grandmother and my aunt. Annette is an old family name in our family. It is not that common anymore. Nice to know someone else is still using it for younger folks. Take care, Annette""I did a lot of personal research after I was diagnosed with FMS. The best site I found was at http://www.myalgia.com. After doing a lot of reading there, I just picked out what worked for me, and my doctor and I worked together until I found a treatment plan. I tried a bunch of antidepressants but none of them were good for me. We went to just treating each symptoms alone, rather than trying to adjust my body chemistry. I take a sleep aid, pain meds, and finally added neurontin which has helped me in many ways. I think physical therapy is only good to teach you things to do on your own. You can<APO>t go forever, as no insurance company will pay for that. Two other books that I found very useful were, ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns, MD, and ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"", by Dr. Margeret A. Caudill, MD, PhD. I got both at a local chain book store for about $20 each. I imagine your local library could also get them for you. They were both worth the money. Take care, Annette""One thing I have learned is that no meds work the same for you or others as they do for me. All we can do is keep trying different things until we find the combination that works best for us. I truly believe that if I get a small amount of relief from each of several different treatments, then the total amount of relief is usually worthwhile for me. One treatment may not give enough relief to seem worthwhile, but when used along with other treatments it is. I don<APO>t think there is a good reason to fear addiction with opiate meds. Less than 5% of users become addicted to opiates as long as they use them appropriately. I think it is wise to be aware of that, but it sure won<APO>t keep me from getting the relief they offer me. I have used opiates daily for up on 15 years now, and have no signs of addiction at all. I totally respect you if you decide for yourself not to even go there. Just be informed. The ""butterfly"" rash on the face is one of the signs on Lupus, if you have had it for a year, your blood tests should also show positive for Lupus by now. Have you ever been tested for it? If your doctor believes you have FMS, he should have tested for Lupus to rule it out. Take care, Annette""The best thing to do is follow up with whatever pediatrician or pediatric neurologist the ER suggests when you leave. They are usually required to offer you a follow up doctor. Most migraines are not often connected to a high fever, is it possible she has a headache as a result of an illness that includes a high fever? Vomiting is a common part of a migraine, as well as other illnesses. These things in children really need to be diagnosed by a doctor and followed up depending on what they find in tests. Having meds at home for these times of illness is very useful. No one wants to have to go off to the ER in the middle of vomiting. Have the doctors suggested any medicine for you to give her at the onset of a headache? Take care, Annette""How often has she had these episodes? Have you sought the opinion of another doctor? Take care, Annette""Hi, BrenBren My son appreciates everyone who says thank you for his service. So do I. He was in the Marines for 8 years, he was part of the invasion of Afghanistan, home for six months, then back for the invasion of Iraq, home again for six months, then went back for another tour in the occupation of Iraq before he finally got out of the Marines. Now he works teaching combat skills to Marines, but works for a private company. Same job he had in the Marines when he got out, same base even, but much better pay, and no more deployments. Thank your nephew for me also. No one knows what it is like to be in combat until they get there, what a wake up call, you are so right. Take care of yourself. Hugs, Annette""Yes, it was difficult as a mom, but more difficult for him. He just turned 32, and has been home for awhile now. He married while he was still in the Marines, but on his way out of the Corps. He has a beautiful toddler, and a teenage son that his wife brought with her to the marriage. My dad was a Merchant Marine during WWII, my uncles were in the Navy, and served in WWII and Korea, my hubby in Viet Nam. No active duty lifers or retirees, just went and did their part and came home. I am so glad to hear that you are writing to our military people overseas, they need to hear from the folks back home. God bless and keep your nephew and his family while they are serving our country over there. I don<APO>t know how couples with kids both serve, can<APO>t even imagine that. My son served early in the wars, we only had email contact sporadically, he was usually out in some hole in the ground somewhere. Strictly, snail mail, lol. I only had direct contact with him when a reporter or someone like that came through with a satellite phone. Thank goodness they have email and Skype set up now. I only take Ambien after I get into bed, prevents the ambien babble, lol. Hugs, Annette""Fortunately, the main side effect I get from Ambien is some amnesia from right after I take it until I go to sleep. I try to take it right after I go to bed, I keep one dose on my bedside table with a bottle of water. Usually, later on the next day, I will remember what I said or did, but it usually takes a trigger of some sort to bring up the memory. Sleeping makes such a huge difference in how well I cope with pain though. Hugs, Annette""I lived in one area that had a group of volunteers that just called shut ins from home. They called them once a day just to say hi and make sure they were okay. If you belong to a church, they often have folks that do this. It is often one shut in calling another, but that is the bright part of the day for someone who can<APO>t get outside. I did a home visiting gig once a week while I was still working, just went and visited with an elderly woman once a week for a little while. We nurses are just made to help people, and when we stop working, we tend to shut down and get depressed and blue. I found I was able to volunteer at a free clinic for 2-3 hours, twice a week, no way would anyone have paid me money to do that little amount of work, or I would have turned it into a work schedule too. But, it was so appreciated. I did that for about nine years. Many nurses only volunteered once a month. Now, I only volunteer once a week for an hour or so at the animal shelter. Again, I know it really helps, but I could not turn it into a paid job. I know I do not have enough good days to work anymore. Take care, Annette""I am not sure if your doctor thinks that the disorder he diagnosed you with, is a different disorder than FMS, or if he does not believe that FMS exists, or if it is a regional difference in nomenclature between new Zealand and the US. The fact that your doc ""does not like the term"" doesn<APO>t tell me much. The other rheumatological condition that you have sounds like an inflammatory one, which would be treated differently from FMS which is a non-inflammatory process. I think the rheumatologists got stuck with FMS because years ago it was thought that FMS was a rheumatological condition. Now they know it is not one, but they still seem to be stuck with it. Not all rheumatologists treat FMS here. FMS seems to be a neurological problem from everything I have read. It also seems to be due to a malfunctioning central nervous system, as your doctor said about your problem. I personally do not think it is all that important what name we put on this disorder. If we have had a workup to show there is nothing else going on, then I vote to just get on with treating the symptoms we do have. If we also have another disorder, we need to treat that also. I think there are probably some people with both diagnoses who were given their diagnosis simply because the doctor didn<APO>t know what to do with them. A doctor failure that can happen. I don<APO>t think the treatment for widespread pain from FMS or widespread pain from what your doctor wants to call it is all that different. I personally do not use newly minted meds just because they have been approved for FMS by the FDA. I use old generic meds that are probably available in other countries, perhaps by the same name, perhaps by a different name. What kinds of treatment did your doctor suggest for your painful condition that he calls Hypersensitive Pain Disorder? Take care, Annette""You mentioned many of the things that I do to control my pain. I am not sure that any one thing is the answer, I believe that doing many different things that bring a bit of relief each will total significant relief when added up. I love my little hot tub, it is big enough for two people if you sit cozy. This tub will end all my pain for as long as I sit in it. Unfortunately, it does not help much after I get out. But, I know that it is always there for me, so if the pain gets bad and is not relieved by anything else, I can go sit in the tub. I get in every night before bed, as it relaxes me enough to sleep. The other really important thing for me is volunteer work. I feel it helps get me out of the house, and involved in the outside world. I volunteered as a nurse twice a week for nine years in a free clinic for folks without insurance. Now I am volunteering at our local animal shelter once a week. That is about all I can tolerate right now, but I love it. There is pretty much something for everyone to do if they really want to. I have lived in communities where they had volunteers call shut ins on the phone just to check on them daily. Anyone can do that. I have volunteered at my local library, I really enjoyed that. I look forward to seeing you here again. Take care, Annette""Hi, Wearthergirl I have used ambien for nearly 15 years now. I have taken it every night and it usually works fine. I am guaranteed a solid 6 hours of sleep, and then doze off and on for a couple more hours. I only raised the dose once back when my son was on his third combat deployment in Iraq, third total, second in Iraq. After trying several other sleep aids my doc put me back on it and raised the dose by half. It has continued to work well since then. What a difference some decent sleep makes!!! I have rarely had side effects from this drug, thank God. My hot tub is a small portable one made by SofTub. I should do commercials for them, lol. I couldn<APO>t afford a more expensive one, and it turned out this IS the one for me. Take care of yourself, and hope to see you again soon. Annette""Hi, Michelle It is good to see you again, but I am sorry to hear that your Crohn<APO>s is flaring again, and you are facing another surgery. Drugs that work well for one of us may not for someone else, or it may be a dosage thing, or side effects. Part of my pain at least is due to neurological problems due to the FMS and DDD. I am glad that you found a lower dose of neurontin was better for you. Anything that helps get those pain scores down, even a little bit, is a good thing. Keep in touch when you can. Take care, Annette""From what I have read about this topic, I gather that oral meds are usually absorbed mainly in the intestine, and some of the bypass procedures shorten the intestine so much that oral meds are not absorbed well. I have read a number of women post on various boards that have terrible time with pain meds for this reason. Not everyone can use the fentanyl patches for a number of reasons. I would not risk it myself. Take care, Annette""BrenBren, Please do not do anything to hurt yourself. Call your doc, go to the ER, call 911, but don<APO>t do anything rash. This will pass, things will get better. I say just be honest with your doc, tell him exactly what you think and want to try. Honesty is usually the best policy. Hugs, Annette""Hi, BrenBren Just know I am thinking of you. Hugs, Annette""It could be a pinched nerve or other neurological problem in your neck, but it could be other things too. I would take your dad with you to the doctor and have him come in the exam room with you and take notes. He may have something positive to offer, and even if he just sits there, it sounds like it would be comforting for you. Take care, Annette""Have you had your arteries and veins checked to make sure your circulation to your legs is okay? A vascular specialist is the best place to go for that. A neurologist would do tests to check the nerves in your legs to make sure they are functioning properly. Those are the first two places I would start. I hope you feel better soon. Take care, Annette""If it has been 8 years and you are having symptoms different from then, I think you should discuss with your doctor getting another study done. It would still be good to get the report on that one for a baseline. Take care, Annette""I<APO>ve never been on the patch, so I don<APO>t know from personal experience about it. Will your pcp give you other pain meds instead of the patch? Will he add to what you are already on, or give you other meds if they don<APO>t work? Take care, Annette""I had a myelogram/CT scan years ago and went to work in the ER as a RN for a 12 hour shift afterwards. I declined the valium he wanted to give me prior to the procedure because I was intending to work later that day. I basically had it done, and went to work a few hours later. I had no headache or back pain afterwards. I have a history of migraines, and could not imagine a headache worse than those. The doctor said if I got a spinal headache it would be severe and I would come back for a blood patch to fix it. We are all different, and will have different symptoms and outcomes. Take care, Annette""Neurologists are specialists in nerve/brain problems and are the ones to see if you do not wish to consider surgery at this point rather than neurosurgeons, who mostly do surgery. Some orthopedic surgeons will also tell you other options besides surgery, but most are primarily surgeons who do surgery. I really believe it is best to avoid even considering surgery for spinal conditions until you are having functional problems, and then you should get all your options first. Take care, Annette""Hi, Moira If you can live okay without narcotics for awhile, I would try that. Use the other meds/treatments you and your doctor do agree on and see how your therapy goes. After awhile, if you are not getting enough relief, approach your doctors again about better relief, but leave the choice of drugs up to them for now. I would also see a therapist/psychiatrist regarding the other issues in your life that contributed to your overdose. I hope you feel better. Take care, Annette""Once a medication is approved for general use, doctors can prescribe it however they want and for whatever they want in many cases. Many drugs are used for off label uses because the doctors can do this. I would do your homework and be very careful when using drugs for off label uses or in any way other than for which it was approved. Read the research and make sure it makes sense to use the drug the new way. Sometimes there is good research for using a drug in a novel way, sometimes there isn<APO>t. I am willing to wait until research shows a drug is good for a new use at this point in my life. Take care, Annette""Addiction to any substance is very difficult to deal with successfully. Are you seeing a therapist who uses cognitive behavioural therapy? Are you going to a NA meeting every day? ""One a day for 60 days"" is what I have heard. It is good that you have a good support system, but it is still a lot of work to stay clean. I am not sure what you mean by a ""mild addiction"", how many pills were taking per day, and what dose, when you switched over to suboxone? How much suboxone are you taking per day? Are you mixing the vicodin with the suboxone? Is the doctor treating you for pain, or for addiction? Were you only taking the vicodin for physical pain, or were you taking them to get high? I will be thinking of you, and hoping you will attain your goals. Take care, Annette""I would make an appt. to go see your surgeon. If I have counted right it is now about 5 weeks since your surgery. I had a regular discectomy (without a fusion) over 20 years ago, and I was back to work full time six weeks after the surgery. It took the full six weeks to get rid of the post-anesthesia fatigue, but the pain was gone and so were the neurological deficits that I had preop. Perhaps trying PT would help. I did do that about 3 weeks postop. They got rid of the tightness in my upper back. If you are no better now than you were prior to the surgery, it is time to have a talk with your surgeon. Take care, Annette""Unfortunately, those of us with chronic pain may never know what it is like to not have any pain, so it may be too much to ask to be normal. It is important to treat your depression. I used cognitive behavioural therapy when I was depressed and it fixed it for me. I had to learn new ways of dealing with life and my reactions to the things that bothered me. There are also medications of various kinds to take for depression, so if the first one does not work go back to your doctor and ask for another. If your regular doctor can<APO>t help you improve things, see a shrink. They are the experts on emotional problems. It is just like seeing a pulmonologist for your COPD or a cardiologist for your CHF. Let me know how you are doing. Take care, Annette""I saw a psychologist many years ago and when I moved away she gave me a copy of the book, ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns, MD as a going away gift. It is about cognitive behavioural therapy. It teaches us techniques for thinking in more positive ways so we do not react negatively to other people, or to situations we find ourselves in.. I read the whole book, it is a very good read. Then I chose to pick out the parts that I thought would help me. The book includes worksheets so you can track your progress as you go along. You can use the book on your own, or with a therapist. You can use it with or without meds. I found it very useful. I cured my depression using these techniques. I suggest using the book with a therapist who does CBT, at least at first. If you can<APO>t find a therapist who will work with Medicare/Medicaid, I suggest you look at whatever universities you have nearby that have therapists doing internships toward their advanced degrees. They work under supervision and are often very good. Best of luck. Take care, Anentte""You need to see your doctor, only he can do an exam and a history and whatever tests are needed to make a diagnosis. Then you can decide on what treatment plan to try. Take care, Annette""I think you are adjusting to your med changes. I will try and answer your questions one at a time. CTs and MRIs are each good for looking at different things. I would let the doctor decide what to order as far as imaging. Keep in mind that often back pain never has a direct cause that shows up on scans, no matter what kind you have. They did a huge study of over 700 patients that showed no correlation between disc disease and back pain. Some people who had perfectly good scans showing no disc disease at all suffered terrible back pain, some folks with back pain had terrible disc disease, and some folks with horrible disc disease had no symptoms at all. Everything I have read about back pain says there really is no perfect way to match it to disc disease. Itching all over is a common side effect of opiates and often goes away with time. If you also have hives, a visible rash along with the itching, call your doctor right away. That could be an allergic reaction. Not common at all, but possible. As far as adjusting the dose, my drug book says that you can adjust the dose upward no more frequently than 3 days after the initial dose and every 6 days thereafter. It suggests keeping track of your BT meds (write them down), then the doctor can adjust your patch by calculating what you are using in BT meds daily. Have you looked at the DVD to see if the report is on the disc? It might well be on there already. Diferent places seem to have different policies as far as when they will give you a copy of your report. I kind of understand why they want your doctor to see it first and explain it to you. They don<APO>t want a hundred calls asking for explanations from the radiologist who read the scan. The radiologist has no idea what your history or exam showed. All he knows is what he sees on the film. Yours is just one of a zillion fims he has seen, to answer a ? he would have to pull up your scan and refresh his memory. They give us the discs because they assume we can<APO>t read them well enough to ask a question. Other places will give them to you if you ask in writing. I just have a note in my doctors medical records that I wish them to send me a copy of every test. As soon as they get it, they send me a copy. It only adds a couple of days to the process. Please DO NOT drive, until you are sure you are safe and are not having any of the symptoms you are complaining about. Anytime YOU feel scared to drive, it is a sign from above that you should NOT be driving. The last thing you need is an accident that harms your child. Forget the legal implications, you would have a hard time living with it, if you hurt anyone in an accident with your car. It is far cheaper to pay for a cab or ask a friend to drive than it is to live with the effects of an accident. Discuss all these symptoms with your doctor, do not adjust or cut your patches in half on your own, or based on what you read on line. Take care of yourself during this time. Hugs, Annette""The laws vary state to state. I worked in the ER and was the one who drew blood for alcohol and drug testing for the police. In that state, your license was only revoked for three months if you refused the test, same thing in the state where I live now, and the state where I grew up. There are seven states that allow RX pain meds to be used by people who drive as long as they are not impaired, according to the newspaper where I live. People who have been on the same dose of opiates for a long time will usually not be impaired. If you live in one of these states, when you increase your dose, you should not drive until you know how you will be while driving. You certainly should never add alcohol and any other drugs. Things like benadryl and other over the counter cold meds can cause impairment just like drinking alcohol does. In these kinds of cases the officer has to make a judgement call and do whatever testing is required in his state. Some tests will only show that you have certain drugs in your system, but not when you took them, other more sophisticated tests will show exactly what your blood levels are at the time of testing. Know the law in your area, and follow it. Never, ever drive your car if you are not positive you are capable of driving safely, no matter what the law is. If you are upset over a fight with your spouse, you may not be able to drive safely. If you have not slept for a long time, you may not be able to drive safely. Know yourself. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know the answer to that one. I have never heard it before. If I hurt bad enough to wear my TENS unit, I don<APO>t want to drive anywhere, so it hasn<APO>t come up for me. Is that something you were told when you got your TENS unit? I would believe whatever your prescribing doctor told you. I<APO>ve been a RN since 1970, that is a long time. Whenever I got bored with one kind of nursing, I would switch to a different kind. Take care, Annette""Does your sister have her own doctor? She should have a doctor of her own who knows her, and who she knows, and is used to. This would make the visit a lot more tolerable for her. Bladder infections can cause widespread pain, but she could also have something else in addition to the bladder infections. Once the urine is clear and has no white cells and no bacteria if she still has pain they will need to deal with that. Did they do a culture in addition to the urine analysis? The culture would show what antibiotic would work the best. The doctors should not be guessing. Did the tylenol #3 give her any pain relief? Is she verbal enough to give the doctors any kind of a history, or is she totally dependent on you to speak for her? She is blessed to have you. Take care, Annette""Seeing her own doctor would be much less traumatic for her than going to the ER if she is developmentally disabled. Both my husband and I can get in to see our own doctors (we have different ones) in a day or two at most for something acute. The last ER where I worked saw a lot of developmentally disabled patients and the environment was not conducive to their care. It may take some looking around to find a doctor in your area who sees these types of patients, but it is worthwhile. Take care, Annette""I would ask the PM doctor who does the injections to refer you to a pain management doctor who does use oral meds to manage pain. If the injections are not working well enough, I would decline to get any more. The studies that Charles has posted in the past seem to indicate that if they don<APO>t work the first time or two, more injections do not work better. If your present doctor is an ""interventionalist"", a doctor who does procedures and injections, but not oral meds, he should not have a problem referring you to a doctor who does other things. I prefer doing a mix of many treatments including oral meds, and I get some relef from each treatment, and that adds up to decent relief. I<APO>ve had the neck of a 90 year old since I was in my 30s. I did have one disc removed when my grip went bad in my dominant hand. The second herniated disc I let heal on its own. As for school, just sit in the back and explain to the teacher ahead of time that you must stand up sometimes due to pain. That way when you quietly stand up and sit down you do not disrupt the class. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""I would ask for a referral to a rheumatologist, but a different one than last time perhaps. Tell him your pain is worse, and the meds you are using does not work, and if he can<APO>t help you to be more functional perhaps someone else can. Do you have specific joint swelling or nodes on your joints? Write down everything. You have done the usual thing for joint pain, tried a variety of NSAIDs and Ultram, and if that is all he has in his bag to fix you, then it is time to move on. I feel it may be more likely that you can get a definitive diagnosis now. Many of the arthritis and other autoimmune disorders take time to declare themselves. At first you have vague symptoms and lab work, later they may change enough to make a diagnosis. I have always had a positive ANA, but never been diagnosed with anything autoimmune. I am just one of those people with a positive ANA, we are out there. But I feel if I were you I would ask for the Lupus specific tests at this point. The test for RA also. Narcotics may or may not be in your future, but if you have a specific illness that requires other treatment, get it. Take care, Annette""You have to know your insurance coverage and how to use it, that is just the way our poor system works. Many people in the US are either un-insured, or under-insured. I am very disappointed in Pres. Obama for settling for what he did instead of insisting on a single payer health care system that shuts out all the for profit insurance companies that we currently have that just make money off of sick people for their share holders. I have had insurance companies that required the step therapy, where they wanted you to try certain older, cheaper meds first, and then work up to newer more expensive drugs. I don<APO>t really have a problem with that, because I don<APO>t believe most newer drugs are any better than the older ones, they just get more $$$ for the drug companies. All the drugs I use now are old, generic drugs. Lidoderm was the only exception to that, but I am not using it currently. I was changed to a step therapy insurance company once because my husband<APO>s company changed insurance companies. My doctor wrote them a letter explaining what drugs I had already tried and why they did not work for me. They accepted that letter and let me start at that point, rather than repeating therapies I had already tried. All I can suggest is having your doctor try that. I would ask the insurance company before you have any tests done if they will be covered. Watch your deductibles and copays so you don<APO>t get anything you aren<APO>t already expecting to pay. It is tough to budget for medical expenses these days. Take care, Annette""I may have missed something entirely, but I never took you to be any kind of drug abuser. I am sorry that you have decided to leave, perhaps you will change your mind. Best of luck in your future, wherever you land. Hugs, Annette""Hi, BrenBren I can<APO>t answer all your questions, but I will answer the ones that I can. I don<APO>t think pain meds, opiates, make you bi-polar. Could a doctor misdiagnose you, sure. If in doubt see a psychiatrist, they are specialists in diagnosing mental illnesses and should be able to do so even if one is on opiates. Opiates are sedatives, not stimulants, so I don<APO>t see how they can cause a ""what goes up must come down"" reaction. I may not be understanding your question correctly. Yes, opiates can cause respiratory depression while you are taking them. Once you are off of them that side effect also goes away. My doctor and I have a treatment/medicine system to use for increased pain so that I do not have to use the ER. I can get a hold of either her or an associate 24/7 by phone. I have only called her twice in 12 years for phone advice, both times were at her request when I changed meds. I generally go in and see her in person if I need something. She keeps an appt. or two unscheduled each day for urgent patient appts. I have always been able to get in to see her within a day or two if necessary. I have never had to go to the ER in the 12 years she has been my doctor. I can no longer use ice for pain, so I use heat via my hot tub. This is a wonderful treatment for me, particularly for muscle tightness. Discuss this with your doctor. I do not use a heating pad, they never worked that great for me. One should NEVER lay on top of a heating pad, you can cause burns to your skin that way. Lay the heating pad on top of you, over a towel so it is not directly on your skin. Ice should also go over a towel to prevent damage to your skin. I do not think the oinment matters as much as the massage does. My hubby likes Tiger Balm, I like it when he rubs anything into my sore muscles. He even rubs my legs and feet when my pain is somewhere else. I feel this distracts my brain from the pain, but whatever it is, it works. Marijuana has never helped me with my pain, so I don<APO>t use it. I did try it years ago for pain. I believe that alcohol never works for pain relief. I cannot count the number of people I saw as an ER nurse who said they tried drinking and it did not help their pain. No kidding, they came in drunk and in pain. I do not believe bosses have a right to know anything about your medical history inclusing what meds you take. All they need to know is if you can do the job they are hiring for. The only exception might be if you are doing work that prohibits certain meds due to professional licensing. Your sentence got cut off at ""noticably..."" so I don<APO>t know what you were going to say. If you were ""noticibly"" drugged you shouldn<APO>t have been there. If you were ""noticably"" in pain, he may have questioned your ability to do the job. Everything I have read says that tolerance is more likely to develop in short acting drugs, than in long acting drugs. No, I don<APO>t believe that tolerance can develop over a single day, it takes weeks, months or years to develop. I think if your BT med works better at 7am than 7 pm it is more likely due to your pain levels or amount of rest or some other factor, perhaps the levels of your long acting med. But, it is not about tolerance. If you are falling asleep while typing, go to bed and sleep. I keep a pad and pen on my nightstand and if I think of something, I jot it down and save it for later. Save all your questions and post them or discuss them with your doctor when you can do so accurately and safely. Write down the answers too. Take care, Annette""Hi, Gail Great response, I think we must have been typing at the same time, as I didn<APO>t see your post until after I had posted mine. Your comments about addicts and mental health disorders are right on. Many people try to self medicate for mental health problems with alcohol or other drugs. My condolences for the loss of your friend. Hugs, Annette""Many anesthesiologists are trained in pain management techniques. If your present doctor won<APO>t increase your oral meds, see this guy and consider what he suggests. If your present PM doctor sees that you are willing to try other things to control your pain, he may change his mind about increasing the oral meds if you still need them. You and this doctor are relatively new to each other aren<APO>t you? It takes awhile to build trust between a doctor and a patient. Skipping around from one doctor to another is not always a good idea. I would only advise it under certain circumstances. Take care, Annette""You need to see your doctor regarding the chest pain, and the leg pain. One of the causes of pain in lower legs is peripheral artery disease, most people who have that also have some disease in the arteries that supply their heart muscle. I have no idea what is causing your chest or leg pain, and no one on line should even try to diagnose you, go see your doctor. You might be a heart attack waiting to happen. Take care, Annette""Everyone needs to see a doctor to get a proper diagnosis. If you can<APO>t afford one, look for a free or low cost clinic in your area. Take care, Annette""You didn<APO>t say what the results of all those tests were???? Tests don<APO>t fix pain, hopefully they lead a doctor to make a diagnosis of what might be causing the pain. Sometimes they don<APO>teven do that. I am a bit confused, why were you going to the chiropractor to begin with? You said the pain started after going to the chiropractor 6 times. I would stop going to the chiropractor until an MD or OD diagnoses your problem and you are positive of what the diagnosis is and that a chiropractor can actually help it. I would not go to a chiropractor for any kind of neck problems at all. Manipulations can cause strokes in some people. It happened to a nurse friend of mine, she lost the use of the right side of her body and took nearly three years to recover it completely. Some skeletal or muscular problems can take many months to heal. You didn<APO>t say when this started. I would follow what your pcp suggests for about three months, then if you still are no better than when you started, I would ask to see a specialist. That is just me, you may feel differently. Be sure to keep following up with your pcp and telling him how you are doing so he can change treatment as necessary. As far as alcohol consumption goes, I know that long term use of alcohol is related to nerve damage and sensory chenges. I don<APO>t think you are old enough to have done that kind of damage yet, but if you feel that you are drinking too much, stop drinking altogether. If you find that you cannot do that, you may have a problem and should seek the help of your doctor. Better now than when you are older and the alcohol has a greater hold on you. Take care, Annette""I am glad to hear you have already seen a cardiologist and he has ruled out heart problems. Was your blood pressure high when you saw the cardiologist? I would avoid the chiropractor until you know just what is wrong with you. I would continue with the neurologist, what else has he suggested since the MRI showed that side of your chest was without gross abnormalities? If he says he can<APO>t find anything wrong neurologically, then ask your pcp where you should go next. Perhaps an orthopedic surgeon could evaluate you for muscle/skeletal problems that could cause pain. I would not put off a pcp until next month, see your current one for now, and ask him what to do about your blood pressure. What were your actual numbers? What one person says is slightly high blood pressure, another person might think is very high. Chronic pain often does not affect the blood pressure at all, so don<APO>t blame it on the pain. Acute pain is known to cause changes in the heart rate and blood pressure (both can go up) but when the pain becomes chronic, the body often stops sending out those kinds of messages and the vital signs often go back to normal. High blood pressure is called the ""silent killer"" because it often causes no symptoms at all until a person has a heart attack, a stroke, or goes into kidney failure. We check everyone<APO>s blood pressure every time they come in to the ER or go to their doctor so we can diagnose high blood pressure early on, before they develop problems associated with it. That is the primary way it is diagnosed. It needs to be treated if it is higher than 140/90 (either number higher merits treatment). A doctor may ask you to try out life style changes first depending on how high it is and other risk factors you may have. But, he should also be making an appt. with you for a recheck and keeping an eye out to see if it goes down with the changes he recommends, or if he needs to try you out on a medication of some kind. Make sure as soon as you do move, that you locate and start seeing a new pcp, take him your records from your present pcp along with the MRI report, etc. Will you have to find a new neurologist as well? Take care, Annette""That BP level is borderline, I would keep an eye on it occasionally with the BP machine at your local pharmacy to make sure it does not go any higher. I would not ask for any particular medicine for pain, let the doctors do their job and decide that for you. Keep a list of what you have tried, the doses and the length of time you were on them so you don<APO>t try a drug more than one time if it didn<APO>t work. Good luck with the move. Take care, Annette""As Swank mentioned in the other post, your pcp should manage your BP. A neurologist probably won<APO>t even mention it until it gets really high. It is easier to manage when it is still creeping up like yours seems to be now. Try the lifestyle changes first and see what happens. Lyrica helps with many kinds of chronic pain, but it may take awhile to start to work really well. Many side effects go away after a few weeks, read the pharmacy insert or ask your doctor if you have any questions. Take care, Annette""He is a grownup and has to decide for himself what to do. I know you want to fix it for him, but you can<APO>t. He needs to be examined by his doctor as jaw/neck pain can be a sign of a heart attack in some men. We do not know his other symptoms, age, medical history, lifestyle, etc. The doctor will take all that into consideration, along with labs, EKG, xrays, etc. and then make a diagnosis. He may be right, he may have just slept on it wrong. But, he may also be incorrect. Take care, Annette""I am glad to hear upon further reading that he has already been to the doctor, and everything is okay. Take care, Annette""BrenBren, I went over and did a bit of reading on the other exchange. Hope to see you again soon. Hugs, Annette""I assume since your PTSD is severe enough to keep you housebound that you have a treating psychiatrist on your team. Perhaps he can recommend something. It would seem like he might have other patients who are home bound who could help you with this. A home health service who has home bound patients may also be able to offer you some suggestions. How long have you been house bound? How did your doctor who is no longer available get your RXs to you if you were unable to go in to see him to pick them up each month? Pain is usually not considered a reason not to be able to go see a doctor as long as someone drives you, you could even use a medical transportation service if necessary. You should never substitute old meds for newer ones without discussing it with your doctor to get to correct information regarding dose, safety etc. You have a ""medical team"" ask them how to deal with this problem. I don<APO>t think a GP should be prescribing opiates at the levels you were taking them, I am not surprised the other doctors in his practice didn<APO>t want to deal with it. I would think it is past time to see a pain management doctor to manage your pain meds. Take care, Annette""Your insurance company should have a list of doctors that they cover. I would start with that list and then see how the doctor rate on reviews or when you interview them yourself. Take care, Annette""The Voltaren in the gel is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and is available by mouth in pill form. There are many other NSAIDs available in pill form also. Baclofen is the muscle relaxant. I use it for flares and find it really works well for me. We are all different. I would go back to the original neurologist that referred you there, and explain what happened to him. He should get a written report from the PM doc (or he can ask for one), then he can decide where to go from here. Take care, Annette PS, I am so glad that the MRI did not show anything more serious than muscle spasms.""Go back to your neurologist and show him the MRI film itself. Ask the PM doc to send a report to your neurologist, so he knows you followed up with him. Muscle spasms and whiplash IS a diagnosis. It is a soft tissue injury, probably from your motor vehicle accident. It can take a year or more to completely heal from a whiplash type injury, at least that is what a doctor told my friend, and it sounds right to me. There is no reason to believe you will get in another car accident, so just take good care of yourself. Your neurologist should be able to prescribe some kind of NSAID and a muscle relaxant or other adjuvant med, along with pain meds if he feels they are necessary. I found baclofen to be very useful as part of my pain med routine, I would not dismiss it so quickly. Many meds need to be used continuously on a set schedule for awhile to work their best and for the side effects to lessen. Take care, Annette Take care, Annette""As far as doing kitchen chores, you might try sitting on a bar stool height chair on wheels. You can then sit to wash dishes or do prep work rather than stand. You can kick yourself around fairly easily if it has wheels. Take care, Annette""I agree with weathergirl, I don<APO>t use any new meds that have not been widely prescribed for at least five years. That way you know what the side effects might be. For me, it would be the same with supplements. I have never heard of g-agmatine before, let us know if you get more info about it. Take care, Annette""As usual Gail54 gave good advice. Have you already been diagnosed with FMS? I would not even mention opiate meds. It should not be about which meds you use to feel better, but that you want to feel better. I would interview the doctor (I use an internist) at your first meeting. Ask how he likes to do things, if he is open to things you find yourself in doing research, what his availability is as far as how soon you can get an appt. if you need on on an urgent basis. I can see my doctor within a day or two, that is important to me. Ask what his usual chain of treatments are for FMS, and how many of his patients have FMS currently. Ask if they are attaining their goals in improving their lives. Keep a pain journal with pain scores of 0-10, include when you take meds, or do any other intervention so he can see how they work for you currently. Write down all the meds you take currently, both over the counter, RX, and supplements. Write down a list of all the treatments you have tried for FMS or whatever your chronic pain is, and what worked and what didn<APO>t and why not. Sometimes doctors tried too low a dose of meds, and trying a higher dose may be more in line with current trends in medicine. That would be a reason I would accept in going back and trying certain things again that did not work in the past. Otherwise, I would move on to other treatments. Ask him if he is going to make you try things you have already done, and why? Let him know what level of pain you can live with, and still perform the activities in your life that you enjoy. I think it is important to establish goals that you wish to attain. Then you can see yourself moving forward in life as you attain them. Then you set more goals and keep on going. If it seems like you have similar outlooks on life with FMS/chronic pain, make another appt. and move forward with your treatment plan. Opiates work for a small subset of folks with FMS, especially if they have had other kinds of chronic pain in the past. They do not work for everyone with pain. I believe they should be tried when everything else has failed, and then they should be used in conjunction with other treatment techniques. If one gets a small amount of relief from each of several kinds of treatment techniques, the total amount of relief can be substantial. I have never heard of anyone with chronic pain being cured and never having chronic pain again. We should be looking for the best outcome we can find. Two books that I have found very useful are ""Feeling Good"", by Dr. David Burns, MD and ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"", by Dr, Margaret A, Caudill, MD, PhD. Both are easy to find in soft back and I only paid about $20 each for them. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""I am not sure what good a medical manager assigned by your insurance company will be. I hope it works out for you. What are this person<APO>s credentials, what is their educational level and their work experience? I understand how they work in relation to illnesses like diabetes and hypertension, but I have no experience in them in relation to chronic pain conditions. I just do not trust insurance companies to do anything but try and keep their own costs down, so they make more money. Please keep in touch and let us all know what kinds of things this person does to help you. Take care, Annette""I totally agree with you, FMS is a body wide illness and requires a variety of treatment modalities to improve well being. I use neurontin, an older drug that is available in generic now, but is very similar to Lyrica. I also use generic ambien nightly, and have for nearly 15 years now. Getting a good night<APO>s sleep is so important for the treatment of FMS. Ambien works best for me for that. Other people use other meds that work for them. I tried many different kinds before ending up on my current meds. I take Vit. D supplements and use opiates for pain also. I tried the antidepressants and they did not work well for me. My husband used Cymbalta for pain management when he developed AVN in his hip. It really helped him, and he had no problem going off of it two years later, after he had his hip replaced. I agree that finding a good doctor is the best thing to do. Mine is willing to tell me no when she disagrees with something I have found in research, and why she disagrees. She has been willing to talk to other specialists also as needed. Take care, Annette""If the vicodin is no longer working do not worry about trying something stronger or a long acting opiate with a short acting one for breakthrough pain. If/when you wish to taper off of them, it should not be a problem as long as you do it slowly and gradually. I have not had the steroid shots in my neck, so I cannot comment on how well it might work. Have a great time in Europe. Take care, Annette""One case of anaphylaxis would be enough to make me steer clear of new drugs for awhile. It sounds like seeing an allergist is a good idea. He can test you for whatever your doctor wants to try you on for pain so you are not home alone when you have a reaction. You could be having some kind of overactive immune response, the allergist can help you with that too. Glad the steroid shot in your neck helped. Take care, Annette""As long as the vicodin works, I wouldn<APO>t go up to anything stronger either. I used vicodin for several years before moving up to a long acting med at night. You will know when you need something stronger, you are the one to make that decision. A good second opinion is important before having surgery on your spine. I would see a neurologist, and a neurosurgeon, ask both what they have to offer you in the way of improvement. I think most spinal surgery has at most a 50/50 chance of improving your pain significantly. Acupuncture helps many people, my MD referred me to an acupuncturist years ago, it didn<APO>t help me, but it did help others. I would give it a try and see what happens. I didn<APO>t even feel the needles. I tried supplements once, the woman selling them offered me a money back guarantee, so I said fine, you give me one months<APO> worth of your stuff, I will take it, and IF it works, I will pay for that month, and order more. It didn<APO>t work, I didn<APO>t pay for it. Never bothered with those fix everything supplements again. I don<APO>t spend $200 a month for all my RX meds. Take care, Annette""There are a number of antidepressants that are used for nerve pain. Although it takes 4-6 weeks for the pills to work for depression, you usually know within a week or two if they will help with pain. That is about the same length of time as the antiseizure meds you mentioned that are also used for nerve pain. I don<APO>t think it is a really good idea to start multiple drugs at one time, then you have no way of knowing which drug is causing relief or which drug is causing side effects. I prefer to start one drug at a time, and add/drop drugs as you see how much relief they are providing. I would suggest you go back to the same neurologist and tell him just how much it hurts, and what kinds of activities you are unable to do because of the pain. I know it is hard to be patient when it hurts, but if you stick with it, you will find the meds that really do help you. Take care, Annette""Did she ever get regular bowel movements? If not, being constipated really hurts, you get abdominal pain from being all backed up with fecal matter. It can also cause vomiting and nausea. I totally understand the comment the doctor made about an antibiotic not working on people in your area. It is NOT a racist comment. This has to do with antibiotic resistance. When people in a certain community have infections and are all treated with the same antibiotic, the bacteria become resistant to that antibiotic, and often a different antibiotic becomes necessary. I worked in a free clinic and the doctors had access to information about antibiotic resistance in different communities. Because we did not have access to a lab to do cultures like the folks with insurance do, the doctors would often rely on that kind of information to decide what antibiotic to use for different kinds of infections. It is far better to have a culture and sensitivity done on all patients that present with a UTI (or any other type infection) based on a urine dip stick test that just shows the presence of blood cells and proteins and such. With a culture and sensitivity the doctor knows within 24 hours if the patient was given the correct antibiotic, and if not they call you on the phone and tell you so you can go get the best RX for that infection. It is very important that she take every pill until they are all gone, do not stop them unless a doctor tell you to. Did any of the places she went to do a culture and sensitivity to determine which antibiotic is best for that infection? You do have to fight for her care, that is unfortunate, but true. So far, based on what the doctors found, she is very constipated and had/has a bladder infection. So the main things so far are, has she had reasonably decent bowel movements daily or every other day? And has the bladder infection resolved? The best way to tell that is to have a urinalysis about a week after she finished her antibiotics. It should show clear by then. I know it is hard to get her in to a regular PCP but keep trying, it will be worth it in the end. Someone who knows her and has her medical records at hand will be the best person to care for her. Take care, Annette""Have you had any luck with your sister improving? I hope she is feeling better and you are getting some rest too. I know how hard it can be for the caregiver/loved one while the patient is ill. Take care, Annette""I totally agree with Caprice, if you question your driving abilities enough to limit yourself, you should NOT be picking up your child from daycare. Most accidents happen near our homes according to statistics. I was in an accident, and rolled my car, fortunately no one else was involved and I was not seriously hurt. I tried to avoid hitting a rabbit and swerved to miss it. I should have just hit the rabbit. No drugs were on board at the time, no high emotions, or alcohol, I just tried to avoid hitting a jackrabbit. This happened within a mile of my home. Aside from that...if you have had injections in the past and they did not work, I would refuse to have any more. Just my opinion. I have never had an epidural or any of those spinal injections that some PM doctors like to do so much. Did he diagnose you with RSD/CRPS or just tell you to go read about it? If you have it, early intervention is very important, but if you are left to go research it yourself, I doubt you do have it. There are pretty significant symptoms in addition to pain. Gail has it among others in this community. My doctor knows I do research on my own illnesses and others for friends and family and she knows I only use reputable, evidence based sources. I don<APO>t simply ""Google"" something, although I may use ""Google"" as a jumping off place. Then I read who did the research, and who paid for it, and how many subjects were involved in the study, etc. I then pick the studies most likely to be helpful. She has never simply told me to do my own research and let her know what I find because she is too busy to do it herself. Seeing an ortho yesterday and expecting him to have spoken to your PM doc by today about his theories of your illnesses is probably not reasonable. It takes days for a doctor to dictate his report, and then he has to ask that copies be sent to the PM doc if that is what you have asked him to do and you have signed written requests for that information to be shared. I have never heard of ""platelet rich plasma"" treatments for back pain or hip pain, what exactly do they do with the platelet rich plasma? Prolotherapy, I have heard of, and I have not read evidence based studies that showed that it was useful. The theory is that by injecting irritating substances into your tissue, it will encourage your own body to fight the irritation and that will cure your pain. I looked into it a few years ago and decided against it. I could not find anything that really showed it worked. Go and read about it and decide for yourself if you would like to try it. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t think there is anything new to cure our pain. I think that if we use a number of different treatments for our pain, and each does help a little bit, the total amount of relief we can get is substantial. I think steroids are okay to be used in short term treatments of 10-14 days once or twice a year for specific problems, but not any more than that unless it is for a lifesaving reason. Steroids have a host of ill effects that can last a lifetime and shorten your life to boot. You really have to balance the risk/benefit ratio if you are even considering using long term steroids. Take care, Annette""Opiates really have limited use in PHN pain. They often just don<APO>t work well. Not that you shouldn<APO>t give them a try, but be realistic about how much relief they may give you. My uncle had Shingles and then the PHN for about five more years. He tried all kinds of treatments, some helped, some didn<APO>t. Then the PHN just went away. That made him very happy, lol. He felt he could deal with the heart attacks and strokes, but not the chronic pain from the PHN. The only med other than the ones you mentioned that I can think of is Lidoderm patches. You can only use it over intact skin, not blisters. Take care, Annette""This post is for everyone who has been given antidepressants for pain and assumed the doctor was necessarily treating depression. In some cases, the doctor probably thought you might be depressed. However.... Antidepressants are not always being given to alter your mood. They also mediate the neurotransmitters that carry the pain signals to your brain. They are commonly used in pain management for this reason. People take great offense for some reason if a doctor offers them antidepressants for pain management. Many people will take antiseizure meds like neurontin or Lyrica for pain knowing they do not have seizures. It is the same thing. Many drugs have been shown to have more than one use. Antidepressants were being used for depression and antiseizure meds were being used for seizures, and doctors noticed that many of those patients also had improved pain. Studies were done and it was demonstrated that they also worked well for pain in some people. Take care, Annette""There are several kinds of capsaicin cream. The only kind that I am aware of that has had any success is the RX type. The first application is extremely painful, then the nerves seem to become less sensitive to it. I feel the over the counter types of capsaicin cream for the most part just don<APO>t do anything that a nice massage wouldn<APO>t do fine with any kind of cream/oil. Acyclovir is an anti-viral agent that is available IV or in pill form and is also available in topical form as an ointment. Take care, Annette""Hi, BrenBren I think you may have mixed me up with someone else who posted. I don<APO>t think I suggested finding a different doctor or better care elsewhere. Doesn<APO>t sound like me. Take care, Annette""Best of luck with your hunt for a new doctor to consult on PHN. Have you seen a neurologist? They seem to be the most up on this kind of thing. Take care, Annette""Using opiates for PHN is of questionable use according to many doctors. They just don<APO>t seem to work well in many patients with PHN, they do work for others. I believe in using what works. I use a cocktail of drugs for my pain and it is what works for me. It took several years to figure that out, but now it is worth it. I would check it out with one or two more neurologists, then do your research and decide what to try. I have not heard of anything really new in this field since neurontin and Lidoderm patches came out. The antiseizure meds, antidepressants, Lidoderm, and opiates in those who respond to them are the treatments that I am aware of. Let me know of anything else you find out. Take care, Annette""From what I read about Qutenza is that it is capsaicin 8% in a patch form. You cannot get this over the counter, that stuff is VERY mild, Qutenza is very strong. The anesthetic cream is used prior to applying the Qutenza patch, then cleaned off. The patch is applied for 1 hour, then removed and the area is again cleaned first with a special cleansing gel, then with soap and water and dried off. If necessary cooling measures can be used to decrease pain or analgesics can be used for increased pain. From what I have read this is all done by a health care professional wearing nitrile gloves after the area to be treated is marked off by the doctor. Qutenza can cause transient increase in BP due to increased pain. BP should be monitored during and after treatment. This is what the Qutenza website says. I wrote it all down last night after I looked it up. It also said that only 274 out of >1600 people were followed in all the combined clinical trials for 48 weeks or longer. That is less than one year. I don<APO>t really like that. For me, for chronic pain patients, one year would be the minimum followup. This whole thing seems less messy than the old capsaicin cream application at the doctor<APO>s office, but I am not convinced it is any more effective. Take care, Annette""Any doctor who has a DEA number can prescribe opioids, including methadone. I think they may not treat opiate addiction with it unless they are part of a licensed program for addiction. My doctor and many others in my community prescribe methadone for chronic pain. I am glad you have found something to treat your PHN with that works for you. It is a tough thing to treat successfully. Take care, Annette""I am so sorry that your pain seems to be coming back. I hope you find something soon that helps you. Take care, Annette""Nothing works 100% for everyone, every time. I am so sorry that it didn<APO>t work this time, I know you were counting on it because it did work last time you tried it during the trials. They will come up with something else to relieve our pain. Take care, Annette""I have a TENS unit that I use for certain kinds of pain. It helps some. I find that if each of several different treatment techniques give a small amount of relief, then the total adds up to a worthwhile amount of relief. This is just one of the tools that I use when I need it. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Usually, you are tested by your physical therapist to see if it will work or not before you buy one. They explain to you how it works and what settings to use. Anyhow, you will get instructions, don<APO>t ask strangers on line, lol. Take care, Annette""If you also had endometriosis, you may have some of this tissue left in your abdomen. It can swell and then bleed when your hormone levels change, particularly if your ovaries are intact. This can cause pain. You would do best to see your doctor. Anytime you have a change in pain (you mentioned this started recently) you should check it out with your doctor. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t think that Medicare will pay for that directly, but I got a tax deduction for my hot tub by having a doctor<APO>s RX for it. Our insurance would not pay for one, and Medicare would not pay for it either. We had to pay the money for the hot tub up front, but were able to add it to other medical expenses when we did our taxes. We only paid $2,700 for a small new one. It sits on our patio, is portable, and it just plugs into 110 current. It is big enough for my husband and I so sit very close, lol. It is far better than a bathtub for soaking, because I can get in it up to my chin. We both use it. It is the only thing I have that completely gets rid of my pain, even if it is only for as long as I am sitting in it plus about 60 minutes. That is long enough to fall asleep. It is always at the temp. you set it for, we keep it at 104 degrees. It is cheap to run too. Take care, Annette""That is the same info I had read about the Shingles vaccine. It works best for those who have not had Shingles yet. Take care, Annette""Thanks for posting this link. I really appreciate it. This is an in the future kind of thing for researchers to do, but it is always nice to know they are up to something. Take care, Annette""Shingles is a later complication of Chickenpox. You have to have had Chickenpox to get Shingles later on in life. The Chickenpox virus goes dormant along the nerves that come out from the spine. Shingles happens when the virus re-activates and causes blisters, itching and pain along the nerve roots. Some people may not remember having Chickenpox as kids if they had a mild case. Other people, like my brother, had encephalitis as a side effect of the Chickenpox. My son had Chickenpox so mildly at about 9 years of age, that had I not seen the few blisters on his back when I was putting away towels in the bathroom while he was in the tub, I never would have known he had them. He had been swimming at his grandmother<APO>s home and thought they were mosquito bites. He had a total of 5 blisters and never had the systemic symptoms that people often do have. He is old enough that he did not get the Chickenpox vaccine as a child because they had not invented it yet. My teenage grandson was in the first group of kids to get the Chickenpox vaccine as soon as it was available. If you think you have Chickenpox, call your doctor prior to going to the office so they can protect other patients so they do not catch it from you. If you get Shingles, keep the blisters covered as others can catch the virus from you through direct contact, although it is not carried through the air in droplet form like the Chickenpox is. Please discuss any vaccines available with your doctor so you get correct information relating to your health history. I have treated folks with Shingles, from their early 20s on up to the elderly, it is a miserable illness to get and has long lasting effects. It is better to not get Chickenpox to begin with than deal with the possible effects later on. Take care, Annette""Some IUDs have hormones in them that are slowly released over time. It may be that the doctor wishes to use this type of IUD in case your pain is due partly to endometriosis. I would also avoid more surgery in case you are one of those people who just develop adhesions, unless there is no other choice. Take care, Annette""Congratulations on being cancer free. That is huge. My husband had lymphoma 20 years ago, and when he decided to stop treatment, the doctors gave him less than six months to live. Here we are, 20 years later, he is doing fine. He went back to work a couple of months after stopping treatment, and slowly but surely got better and better. I am also lucky enough to have a great doctor. She has been my doc for over 10 years. She is my PCP and also manages my pain. I do not give out her name without her permission, she is not always taking new patients, and I am very protective of her because she is so good to me. We are both blessed. Take care, Annette""In most states you will need your parents/guardians to take you to the doctor, so be sure to let them know how you are doing from day to day. It is possible to have mono and also have something else at the same time. It is up to your doctor to diagnose you by examining you carefully, doing a medical history, and ordering and evaluating lab tests, xrays, etc. There is a simple blood test to screen for mono, and a swab of your throat to see if you have strep or another bacterial infection that requires antibiotics. Mono does not require any antibiotics as it is a viral infection. Sores in your mouth are farily common with viral infections. There are a number of things to do to make it easier to eat/drink while they heal. Have your mom talk to your doctor about this. Often just changing the temperature of the fluids you drink will help a lot. You don<APO>t need to eat solid foods for quite awhile as long as you can drink nutritious fluids. I hope you feel better soon. Take care, Annette""Well put, Geraldine. Take care, Annette""Hi, Transcriber52 You have discovered my favorite book. It has been so helpful over the years for me. Take care, Annette""Congratulations on having clear nodes and margins!!! That is huge. I would talk to an oncologist who specializes in breast cancer treatment, and do some research on your own as far as radiation therapy goes.I think it depends on what kind of cancer you had, and how aggressive it was. Anytime one removes a lymph node, one disrupts the flow of lymph fluid. I don<APO>t know how long one can expect fluid buildup to occur. That is a question you have to ask your surgeon. Don<APO>t let him get away with not answering. Write down all your questions, and bring a pad and pen with you to write down the answers that he gives you. If he doesn<APO>t give you a clear answer, just keep asking him again to clarify his answer. If necessary take a family member of friend with you, some doctors are more talkative if they know a witness is present. Take care, Annette""It may not be related to your fall at all. It may have just developed around the same time and you are more aware of your back due to your fall. See the doctor that you are being referred to. Let us know what he says. Take care, Annette""Are you guys seeing a therapist to try and learn to talk to and hear each other more accurately?Are you seeing anyone on your own to deal with the coping skills one needs to deal with chronic pain? Ask around and see if you can find someone for the two of you to see, or even just you alone if he won<APO>t go right now. He may agree to go later on, or he may not. But, even if only you go, you should learn some good skills. Take care, Annette""Hi, BrenBren I tried looking it up and it is not listed as a sleep aid, just for management of bipolar disorder, psychosis, and off label for autism. That said, many drugs are used off label as doctors find they are helpful for other things. You are taking a very low dose. I would ask the doctor how long he would expect you to take to get used to it and adjust to the dose you are on. I did not see anything in my drug book about dosing by weight. Again, ask the doctor or your pharmacist. Hugs, Annette""I am not familiar with using this drug for sleep, what did the doctor give you for instructions? Does it say on the bottle to take one each night, or does it say only as necessary? I would try whatever the doctor says for a couple of weeks, then go back and tell him how it is going. Take care, Annette""You need to be seen by a doctor and possibly have an imaging study done. Since you don<APO>t have insurance, I would look for a free or low cost clinic in your area. Try calling Goodwill, Salvation Army, Catholic Charities, your county medical dept., etc. They usually know what is available in your community. You can also Google it by typing ""free clinics, (your area)"" in their search engine. Volunteers in Medicine run clinics in some communities. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""I agree. My pcp or my rheumatologist are the only ones who have ever managed my pain. I saw a pain management specialist a couple of times at the beginning of my care on Oregon, and he agreed with what my rheumatologist was doing. I have been with my current pcp, an internist, for over ten years. She has always managed my pain and done a good job. She recently sent me to another pain management specialist for a consult, and after a thorough exam and history he told me he had never seen a chronic pain patient that was managed so well. He really wouldn<APO>t suggest anything else. My state requires a consultation with a specialist for any people who are being treated with opiates for chronic pain. As long as the two doctors agree on your treatment, the doctor documents everything well, and sees the patient regularly, the government stays out of it. I have not spoken to any doctors since I moved here ten years ago who felt the government was looking over their shoulder. I really agree with you about explaining how the pain limits your function, that makes it as clear as possible how it is affecting your life. Take care, Annette""Since you ortho is sympathetic to what is going on with you and this doctor, perhaps he could refer you to someone else. With his intercession it might be easier to find someone who will take you, pump and all. Take care, Annette""It could be Shingles, but you won<APO>t know without seeing your doctor for an exam. Shingles is often hard to diagnose until the rash comes up because many things can cause pain. The pain, the location, and the appearance of the rash all together usually make it easier for the doctor to make a diagnosis. If the pain is different from your usual pain from your low back problem, see your doctor as soon as possible. The sooner the doctor can start antiviral therapy, the more likely it is to work and prevent long lasting pain in that area. If it is not Shingles, then the doctor can get on with making another diagnosis. Keep the rash covered until he sees you and makes a diagnosis because Shingles can be catching through direct contact. Take care, Annette""Some people just respond better to a slightly different opiate. Let your doctor know it is not working and ask for something else. We can all develop tolerance to a pain med over time if we take it regularly. Does the vicodin never work for your regular pain or is it just not working for this added Shingles pain? Vicodin never gives me the side effects you mentioned but it does decrease my regular pain for about 4 hours. I have used it for breakthrough pain for well over 10 years. It may be that you need a long acting opiate, at least for the time it takes for the Shingles<APO> pain to subside. Take care, Annette""Don<APO>t expect to feel a bit better everyday, you will have ups and downs, but the trend should be on the better side over weeks to months. Everyone reacts differently to meds, if the Ultram works better for you, let the doctor know when he picks up his RX pad to write you something for pain. A friend says Vicodin works better for him than Percocet, also a bit backwards, but that is what works for him. Hope you get well soon. Take care, Annette""I hope you continue to get a bit more relief each week. I am glad your work has sick time to cover you during this time. Take care, Annette""Hi, Fern I am glad your doctor got you in to see her. The sooner you get started on the anti-virals the quicker they will work. It can still take awhile to heal so try and be patient. Keep the blisters covered until they all break open and scab over. They are contagious by direct contact until then. Wash your hands frequently, I know they itch and it is all too easy for us to scratch without even thinking about it. Take care, Annette""I am glad to hear you are taking something to help. Try to be patient, this too will pass. Take care, Annette""Thanks for the compliment. It is appreciated. Always glad to help. Take care, Annette""Thanks for the link Charles. Pain-topics is a great site, it has a lot of article and information for all of us. Most of it is based on real research so our doctors will appreciate it more than commercial type articles that are just trying to sell stuff. Good to see you again. Take care, Annette""I would not go with any kind of surgical procedure until all other pain control methods have failed. I would rather take large doses of opiates than have surgery that has only a 50/50 chance of helping even a little bit. Just my opinion. Take care, Annette""I can understand their hesitance due to the suicide attempt. Do you live with a person who would be responsible for your meds and dole them out to you one day at a time? At least for awhile, until your doctor feels more comfortable. If not, the doctor has every right to ask you to try a non-drug approach for awhile. If you don<APO>t have a positive reaction during the trial for the SCS, be very honest with him. Maybe you will get lucky and it will work for you. Given the possible risks and benefits of the SCS vs. another possible suicide attempt, the SCS looks better. Suicide is often a permanent solution for a temporary problem. Take care, Annette""That is such a low dose of opiates, that it seems like you could go quite awhile before you would even need to consider an SCS. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Hi, Beth That sounds like the sensible way to make a decision to me. Having the actual numbers would make it seem like real evidence to base a decision on. I have not actually spoken to anyone who got the SCS and were able to discontinue their opiates completely either. I am afraid it may be a sales pitch... I think many people are able to decrease their use of opiates though. As long as people are given actual data to base a decision on, it is up to them. I am glad to hear yours is working out well for you. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t understand why if the meds worked fine in the past, you don<APO>t just stick with them? This is a surgical procedure with possible risks and benefits. Anesthesia also has risks. Anything that causes a break in the skin can cause infection. It is up to you, of course. Take care, Annette""If you develop a fever, abdominal pain becomes an emergency that requires seeing a doctor. Remember that your appendix is on the right side of your abdomen, but lower down than your rib cage. Your liver is right up under the edge of your ribs on the right hand side. There are free clinics in many communities, try Googling ""free clinic in (your area)"" of calling Goodwill, Salvation Army, Catholic Charities, or your health department. Take care, Annette""Also remember that if you do have to go to the ER or any hospital that takes Medicare/medicaid (they all pretty much do) they are required to provide a certain amount of indigent care of folks who do not have insurance. Unfortunately, they do not tell you about that up front so you can plan. AFTER you get your bill, you call the business/billing office and ask if you are eligible for any kind of help. You may have to give them financial information about your household. Sometimes they forgive the bill entirely, sometimes they give you a discount, or let you make monthly payments. You don<APO>t know until they tell you. But, usually as long as they know you are trying, they will work with you and not send you to collections. Take care, Annette""Only a doctor can examine you and do any necessary tests and make a diagnosis. We can<APO>t do that for you on line. All I can suggest until then is to avoid the walk-in, and other cold places. Take care, Annette""You need to have a doctor examine you and do any necessary tests so that you will get a diagnosis. Then perhaps someone here who has had something similar can offer you suggestions about what might help. There are a bunch of things that can cause belly pain. No one can tell you on line what it is. Take care, Annette""Amox-clav and Amoxicillin both can cause abdominal pain, and my nursing drug handbook says that the patient should let the doctor know if this happens, not to just ignore it. However, since you say you have had this pain before and it is now worse and lasting longer, I would hesitate to blame it on the medicines. Either way I would see the doctor and ask him to assess your abdomen and see what is going on. Some meds can be taken with food and some should always be taken on an empty stomach. Some kinds of food and drink can change how medicines act, so I would ask your doctor or pharmacist about taking this one with food and what kind of food to get the best result. Be sure to always take antibiotics as ordered until you finish them, do not stop early because you feel better, or skip doses. Sinus infections can be particularly hard to get rid of, and the antibiotics are sometimes given for as long as six weeks, depending on what is going on and what antibiotic the doctor is choosing to use. Take care, Annette""It may not turn out to be serious, but only your doctor can tell you, based on an examination and any tests he deems necessary. Hopefully, it is no big deal. Take care, Annette""I assume you were seen by some doctor and had your heel xrayed to confirm the fracture??? I would just do what that doctor says to do as long as it works. Heel fractures can be relatively minor or very complicated, depending on the injury. It is very important to keep the heel elevated higher than your heart most of the time to relieve pain and swelling. No pain med in the world will help if you don<APO>t do that. A bag of ice over a towel may also help relieve pain and swelling. Did the doctor feel a cast or a walking boot was necessary? Go see your doctor and let him know how you are doing and see if he has any other suggestions. Take care, Annette""Whenever you have a new or different type of headache, you should have your doctor check it out. Usually, it is a treatable, minor thing. But, occasionally it is something serious. My husband had a sub-dural hemtoma and his first symptom was a severe headache. I have a long history of migraines, I used ice packs over a towel on the back of my neck. That helped a lot. Or heat, only the individual knows what works for them. The first thing to do is see your doctor. Take care, Annette""I have learned over the years that headaches tend to go on a scale from tension headaches with muscle pain and a headache, on one end, to migraines on the other end. We can get a headache that falls anywhere along that line, with symptoms to match. I have always been on the migraine end, but some people have headaches more on the tension end, and some folks have headaches with symptoms that fit both kinds of headaches, or headaches with other symptoms that vary at different times. I have had migraines for about 30 years now, lots has been learned since I started having headaches. I would go along with the flexeril for now, it not only works as a muscle relaxant, it has some of the same properties as elavil which is often used for migraine headaches as well. Give it a few weeks and then let the doctor know what is going on with it, if it is helping or not. I would also call the doctor<APO>s office and check on the xrays if you don<APO>t hear from them. I do not accept the ""We will call you only if something is wrong."" that many doctors<APO> offices tell us. I want to make sure someone tells the doctor if anything is wrong, and being one of the people that hears the results makes sure he knows too. Just a precaution I opt to take. No doctor has ever had a problem with the office sending me results of tests once he gets them. Take care, Annette""I am so sorry to hear about your father<APO>s illness. Usually you can call for hospice care when the patient has about 6 months to live. They can do home care or hospital care. You didn<APO>t mention how old your dad is, if he is 65 and/or has Medicare, you can find out what they cover by calling them, usually insurance companies also cover hospice care. The good thing about hospice is that they are great at pain management towards the end of life. The nurses are very well trained and love their work. They take care of the whole patient in order for them to live what time they have without unnecessary pain and discomfort. They also do the basic nursing stuff like skin care and bowel care. As a person becomes less mobile and uses more pain meds they often tend to become constipated. These nurses are used to that and know how to prevent it. Constipation can cause acute abdominal pain and nausea and vomiting. Make sure your dad does the basics in preparation if he has not already. Make sure the family/wife knows the financial situation, and he has a living will for health care that specifies just what he wants done towards the end of his life, and who can speak for him if he can<APO>t speak for himself. He should also do a regular will/living trust with his lawyer if possible so that his wishes are carried out after he is gone about his material things. I lost both my parents to cancer, my dad at age 47 and my mom at age 69. She did a much better job of getting things in order than he did. She learned from his mistakes. My best friend<APO>s mom used my mom<APO>s knowledge when her husband died, and my best friend used it next when her mom died. If nothing else, these women made sure their kids did not have the problems they had when they lost their spouses. They all talked about dying openly and had a plan, both ahbout. I feel blessed to have known my parents were going to die, so we could talk abut stuff that we might have missed out on had they died suddenly in an accident. One thing I should have made my mom do before her time came was to write the names on the back of photos! It seems like a little thing, but now we are trying to figure out who is who and have no one to ask. Talk, talk, talk to your dad. Enjoy the year you have left. Do what he needs to do, encourage him to be open with his doctor about his needs. By the way, no one can put a time line on someone else<APO>s life. They told my husband he was going to die in six months, that was 20 years ago. He had cancer too, and opted to quit treatment because it was too painful and made him too sick. He was 6<APO> 3"" and weighed 145 pounds. He just got well, and to this day, no one knows why. He is 65 years old now and just retired from an active life of rock climbing and working as a truck mechanic. They told my cousin he was going to die in a matter of two weeks, and he lived about six months longer, that was wonderful time that he spent with his sister and family. You never know. We could all die tomorrow. He is lucky to have a family member who is taking care of these things for him and worrying about him being in pain. Enjoy him now. Keep in touch. If he develops pain later on, there are many people here with all kinds of suggestions for pain management that has worked for them over the years. Take care, Annette""The tramadol works well for many people. I have only used the IR form of the drug, not the once a day kind. I took it up until about six months ago along with my other pain meds. I could always tell that it worked. I only stopped becuae my doctor changed one of my other pain meds and I no longer needed the tramadol. Tramadol is in a drug class all by itself, but it works on the same opiate receptors as the stronger opiates. Norco contains hydrocodone and acetaminophen (Tylenol). Hydrocodone does not come in a stand alone product in the US unless you have a compounding pharmacy make it up just for you. Then it is just called hydrocodone, not Norco. I still use Norco in its generic form for BT pain. Norco always has Tylenol in it, but it is generally the lowest dose available, 325 mg. per pill. As long as you find this combination of meds useful, that is great. If you ever need to change them, be sure to tell your doctor that they no longer help. Take care, Annette""I would make sure that some other adult is aware that you are trying a new med, but I advise that any time you try a new med. Just in case you have any kind of reaction or side effect that you may not notice yourself. Hydrocodone and tylenol is a minor opiate, one of the weakest ones available. Use it if you and your doctor decide you need it, and it sounds like you do. Take care, Annette""I would only consider a surgically implanted device if I had really tried all the meds available in all their combinations along with non-drug techniques and was still in considerable pain. The meds and other treatments are not meant to take away our pain, nothing really does that, it just decreases the pain to a managable level. I have never been able to sleep flat on my back, no doctor ever suggested that I do so. I sleep best laying on my side with pillows between my knees, and in front of me to support my body and upper arm, in addition to under my head of course. This keeps my spine in proper alignment to prevent pain as much as possible. I use my hot tub daily as that really helps me to sleep better it I sit in it for 10-15 minutes just before bedtime. I have also used antidepressants and anti-seizure meds, in addition to anti-spasmodic drugs and sleep aids along with opiate pain meds. Usually it takes a cocktail of various meds to help with the pain, not just opiates. Using many different techniques and meds help me bring down my pain scores enough to make live comfortable most of the time. No one thing is the answer. Take care, Annette""I got mine after trying out a friend<APO>s to make sure it would be useful. I was able to take a credit on my income taxes under medical expenses once I had a RX from my doctor saying it was necessary. We got a portable SofTub barely big enough for the two of us. It runs on 110 electrical, so we just plug it in on our patio. It only cost about $2900 when we replaced it with a new one after 11 years about one year ago. I only paid about $1400 for the original one twelve years ago. Same kind, we like them. My rheumatologist many years ago who wrote the original RX for it told me they only help about half of his patients so I should try one out before buying one. Many motels/hotels that have spas and swimming pools will let non-guests use them for a small feel. Some gyms also have them. I had a gym membership just for the pool and the hot tub for about a year before we bought our own hot tub. I make myself use it every night before bed, because I feel so much better and I sleep so much better. Even if I don<APO>t feel like I need it, I end up getting up in the night and using it then. It is SO worth it. I should be their salesperson, lol. Take care, Annette""The only new pain med I have heard about is something called tapentadol HCl, it is available in 50, 75, and 100 mg. doses. It is not available in long acting form though. According to my nursing journal it is indicated and approved by the FDA for moderate to severe acute pain, although it was also tested in people with degeneratvie end stage joint disease of the hip and knee. According to the drug company that makes it, Ortho-McNeil, its effectiveness was comparable to the ""strong opioids"". In addition to acting on the opiate receptors in the central nervous system, it also inhibits norepinephrine reuptake, which increases norepinephrine levels in the brain. Common side effects are nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and somnolence. I personally do not recommend using ANY new drug until it has been widely prescribed for at least five years, this weeds out the ones that end up getting pulled off the market due to adverse effects. As far as getting your Zofran paid for, what I found when my husband was on W/C was that once we got a letter from the W/C insurance saying they would not pay for any treatment, his insurance through his employer was willing to pay for it. Took more paperwork but it ended up working out in the end. Zofran is relatively new, and very expensive. There are some other older, cheaper antivomiting meds besides phenergan that you could also try. Tigan, compazine, and visteril come to mind immediately, there are others also. I did not find Levisin in my drug book, ask the doctor what else he could prescribe in place of it. There are very few drugs that don<APO>t have alternates that will work just as well. You didn<APO>t mention when your nausea/vomiting started in relation to when you started or increased the methadone dose that you take. It may or may not be related to the methadone. Another pain med that is long acting, cheap and has not been used as much as the others is levorphanol. You might ask about that one. Take care, Annette""Go see your doctor. He can do a test to see if your hormones are out of whack. You don<APO>t mention your age. I went seven months without my period in my forties, then it came back regular as ever for another ten years. My doc tested my hormones and gave me some hormone treatment for quit awhile. No estrogen, just progesterone. Your doctor can also test for anything he feels might be causing your leg pain. It doesn<APO>t really sound like a hormone thing. But when he checks your blood for that, he can also order other tests at the same time, AND do an exam, which is usually the most important thing. Take care, Annette""I would follow up with the rheumatologist. Once someone has a chronic pain condition like TMJ, the pain can spread and folks can develop RSD or Fibromyalgia. If she has seen a neurologist he probably would have noticed RSD, and a rheumatologist is the one to diagnose FMS. You can find out more about Fibromyalgia at http://www.myalgia.com. Try reading up on that and see if it fits what your mom is having. If it is, print out the articles and have her take it with her to the rheumatologists visit. You might go with her if she wants you to. I would avoid chiropractors for now. Get a real diagnosis first, before even considering one. Congratulations on your upcoming wedding. Take care, Annette""Cabrel, I have to agree with Gail and Transcriber. Your wife is on a collision course with her meds and alcohol use. It is not possible for us to say why she continues to do this. I suspect it is for mixed reasons. I believe that she is in pain, but I also believe she is an alcolholic. If she is doubling up on her pain meds (for any reason) some days, that means that part of the month she is going without meds. She may well be undermedicated for her pain, but it would be dangerous for her doctor to give her any more meds while she is drinking alcolhol at all. You are correct, tolerance does not seem to play an issue in her case at this point. If you cannot tell she is drinking, then there is no way for you to tell how much she really is drinking. Many women drink slowly all day in secret and maintain a buzz all the time. If you got a breathalizer and had her blow in it, then you would know just how much alcohol is in her system. But, honestly, that may be the only way to tell accurately. Women drink differently than men do, metabolize alcohol differently than men do, and tend to keep it more secret due to shame issues. Moderate drinking in women is ONE drink a day. So, even three drinks a day is a problem. Not to mention mixing it with narcotics. 20/20 on ABC just had a show about women alcoholics, you may be able to find some info on their website. If any of her pain meds have tylenol in them, like Norco, Vicodin, or Percocet, or anything with APAP included, that combination with alcohol can be very hard on her liver. I feel she should get straight with both her pain doctors and her therapists. It would be nice if you discussed this with her early in the day before she gets too loaded on anything, and suggested the two of you go to her PM doc together first and tell him together just what she is doing. Then tell her therapists/psychiatrists, again together. I fell it is important you tell them together so that you are certain she has told them and exactly what she has told them, and what their plan is. People in your wife<APO>s position do not always tell the truth. Otherwise, you have to decide whether you should call her PM doc yourself, and tell him what you know, or whether to wait and pick up the pieces when it all comes crumbling down. Keep in mind that this is a deadly combination of substances, both for overdoses and withdrawals of the two substances together, and 911 calls may be in your future. She could die. If you tell her PM doc or her therapists what is going on, remember that they may not tell you anything about her treatment due to HIPAA laws without her permission. They can listen to you though. She may be a person who is better suited for other types of pain management, rather than opiates at this point in her life. My heart is with you both. Take care, Annette""Ditto what Caprice said. Check in with your doctor and your therapist. There are always things that can help just a little bit more, and often that keeps us from going over the edge. Take care, Annette""You are correct, COBRA is a federal program, the same in all the states. My husband stopped working for a couple of months last year to have his hip replaced, then worked until last year when he retired. I am very familiar with COBRA. It cost us over $300 a month for his medical and about the same for mine. Even with the federal subsidy it was cheaper for us to both go on Medicare when he retired. He paid the COBRA for the time he was off for his hip surgery just because it was easier for us do deal with the same insurance company for that amount of time. I went on Medicare for 2-3 months then and back on his employer<APO>s insurance when he went back to work. At this point we are both on Medicare. Various states may have other programs, but COBRA is the same from state to state. Take care, Annette PS, Best of luck on your TKR.""I am so glad to hear you are okay. That is the most important thing. When the hospital sends you the bill, call their business office and ask if you are eligible for the indigent assistance program. They may be able to discount part of your bill, or even all of it. Be ready to have financial information available for them as they may ask for that stuff. At the very least they will be able to work out a payment program for you so you don<APO>t get sent to collections. Resist them if they suggest putting it on a credit card (they always tell people to do that, it is a bad idea for many reasons), just tell them you don<APO>t have one. Then you would have to pay interest on your balance on the card, as well as pay off the bill. Most hospitals will carry debt for about two years, as long as you make regular payments. Ask!!!!! All they can do is say no, and you may get some real help. Take care of yourself. Hugs, Annette""Stick with the VA as long as you can. They have pain management options available. The tests doctors do can show no structural reason for your pain, but you still need treatment for your pain. You can still have pain even with no positive reason on your MRIs or other scans. I have little or no faith in the W/C system in the states I have lived in, but the VA gives better care if you qualify for it. Thank you for your military service. My son was a Marine for eight years and I know the sacrifices it takes. Take care, Annette""I am not sure if you are asking if it is safe to take both kinds of medicines for the prescribed use at the same time, of if you want to take them for different kinds of pain than they were prescribed for. You should not use one pain medicine for a different kind of pain than it was prescribed for. If the vicodin was prescribed for your migraines, you should not use it for other kinds of pain, unless you have spoken to your doctor. Meds like Imitrex and Zofran are really only good for certain things, and would not help if you took them for other kinds of problems. Because of the limitations of certain meds you would be wasting them if you took them for something they would not help anyway. Lidoderm patches also should only be used for certain types of pain, and you should discuss their use with your doctor or pharmacist. It is safe to use the Lidoderm patches along with your migraine meds as long as the pharmacist and your doctor gave you the okay. I use them both together without any problem. Both my doctor and my pharmacist know that I use both Imitrex or another type of triptan and the lidoderm patch and opiates at the same time, but for different kinds of pain. I don<APO>t use Zofran, so I don<APO>t have any personal experience for that one. Ask your pharmacist and he should be able to reassure you. Take care, Annette""You should always see your doctor for any new or different kinds of aches and pains you may have. Pain in your toes can indicate systemic illness like diabetes, so it is doubly important to be checked out for pain or slowly healing wounds on the feet. Take care, Annette""I hope all goes well. Take care, Annette""You should still be able to see your pcp. He can advise you about meds while pregnant until you see an OB. Who is prescribing your meds now? Does he/she know you are pregnant? Please let all your doctors know you are pregnant, and they can advise you about meds. My mom drank a glass of wine every evening and continued to smoke through out her five pregnancies. They did not know all the stuff they know now. She had five beautiful, healthy kids, all slightly above normal birth weights. There are other non-drug treatments for sciatica, ask your doctors about them. My mom had the four kids when she discovered she was pregnant with my youngest brother, the four older kids varied in age from five to 13. It was not good news for her at the time, but she really had no other legal options. Later on, she was glad to have this last kid at age 41. We have options now, think about it, although it sounds like you have already made up your mind. Best of luck whatever you decide is right for you. Take care, Annette""Hi, BrenBren My drug handbook gives oxycodone a B/D rating for pregnancy, depending on when in pregnancy it is used and what the dose is. This means it can either be fine or really bad. I think it is best to discuss this with your own doctor and get guidance from her. That said, I agree with you about many things. It is amazing how little meds we actually find we need when push comes to shove, and a baby is involved. It is only for awhile. It is also amazing how well many babies turn out despite the meds their moms take during pregnancy. I also agree with you about just not telling anyone but your doctors and a select few others if you find you need meds during pregnancy. The negativity is really not good for pregnant moms. People may mean well when they give advice about not taking anything while pregnant, but it is not always possible. Take care, Annette""If the doctor said the xrays and MRI showed that there was nothing wrong, he probably meant to say that the MRI did not show any structural problems like disc herniations. You can still have pain from other problems like muscle spasm or nerve damage or even migraine type problems. No one here can diagnose your problem. I would go see a neurologist before I saw a pain management doctor or make an appt. for both kinds of specialists. Take care, Annette""Everyone is different in recovery time. My girlfriend had one done a few years ago, she had no change in her back pain at all, and developed sciatic pain along with the back pain she already had. The surgeon saw her once before the surgery and told her the back pain would be gone after the surgery. She had never had sciatic pain before. He finally saw her once for the sciatic pain, after she got the phone run around and threatened to call a lawyer, but denied the surgery was the cause. He gave her an injection of a non-opiate pain med, and refused to see her again, said there was nothing more he could do. She saw her pcp and he took care of her after that. The sciatic pain went away after about 6 weeks, and she was left with her same old back pain. Personally, I would not have surgery of any kind for back pain, I have been on long acting opiates for over twelve years now for my chronic pain. They don<APO>t affect me except that I don<APO>t have as much pain. I am not all dopey or anything like that. Most of my pain is from FMS, not directly from my disc disease. I had a cervical disectomy in 1992 because I had a functional deficit, and was losing the use of my right hand. I was off work for 6 weeks. It fixed the functional deficit. The disc above the fusion herniated about six months later, and I opted not to have a surgical discectomy for that one, I just let it heal on its own. I had pain and numbness in my arms. But after a year and a half that improved somewhat. I continue to have numbness in my arms if I hold my neck in certain positions. My neurosurgeon said that he would never do a discectomy for pain only. He felt the odds were only about 50/50 that it would help pain. He only did them for functional deficits. I feel the odds have not changed much since I last saw him. Best of luck to you. Only you can decide if the surgery is right for you. I would not consent to having it done until YOU feel it is the right thing for you. If that means having it done later, do it later, if you are convinced it is right for you, do it as soon as you want to. Do NOT let a surgeon push you into doing it before you are ready. Talk to your pcp as well, he probably knows you better than a surgeon does. Take care, Annette""I think you should see your doctor and let him know what is going on with you so he can assess you and give you the latest information about what you can expect. People with broken ribs are seldom given rib belts or wraps anymore, at least not on the West Coast where I have worked, that is old medicine. Studies found that if people wore rib belts or ace bandages around their ribs, they breathed less deeply and often ended up with pneumonia or other lung complications. In the ERs where I have worked as a nurse, patients with broken ribs were told to take at least 4-5 deep breaths every hour and to cough 4-5 times an hour holding a pillow up against the injured area to splint the broken ribs. The doctor prescribed pain meds as he thought best. At a year and a half post injury the bones should have healed, you need to be re-assessed for your continued pain. There may well be something else going on and it may be treatable. Take care, Annette""Hi, Swank I was trying not to start another fight, I am only aware of what we do where I have worked, and I am aware that in some geographical areas doctors use different treatment methods and different medicines. I have been an RN for 40 years and it has been at least 35 since I have even seen this done for broken ribs. My dad broke ribs twice when I was growing up and he was never wrapped either. It is nice to know that I am not the only person with this experience, and that they do it the same way on the East Coast. Take care, Annette""It is not up to us to find more experts. WebMD has contracts with these people, and it is their job to monitor this problem. They are well aware of the fact that many of the experts do not ever post, or rarely post. They say they are dealing with it. Sorry. Take care, Annette""I am certainly not offended. I am not working for WebMD, I am just a member here like everyone else is. I post often because I feel I have something to offer due to all my own experiences. I am sorry that the site says there are experts available when there are not, but like Caprice says, they are working on it. Take care, Annette""You need to see a doctor about all of this. You cannot get a diagnosis on line. You need a proper examination and may need some tests. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I have no experience with Prialt. Please make sure and do all your reading about it. There are lots of side effects, and it is fairly new. Take care, Annette""That sounds like a better alternative to me. You can see how you do with one dose of the Prialt and then decide what to do next. I hope all the other tests go well. Take care, Annette""Just don<APO>t feel pushed into making a decision about this drug. If you aren<APO>t ready to try it on Tuesday, just ask for a while longer to think about it. No doctor should be pushing you about this or any other drug for chronic pain. Have you discussed it with the doctor who is prescribing your psych meds? Take care, Annette""Discuss this with your doctor, he has far more experience with Prialt than any of us seem to. He will know if one injection is enough to make a decision on or not. You do get to decide whether to try this drug even once, so don<APO>t let anyone push you into anything. With some drugs, you can tell by the initial dose if anything will change. I don<APO>t know if this is true with Prialt or not. Take care, Annette""I have not been able to find any good quality, double blind studies that show one opiate is any better than another. I think the main thing is finding the right dose. Whether you use fentanyl, dilaudid, or morphine in your pump, unless you have side effects that are unmanagable, I would just keep increasing the dose slowly until you get relief. If you don<APO>t get relief from any of them, then unfortunately opiates may not be the right meds for you. I only think Prialt would be worth even trying after you have tried all the other options and are willing to take the risks involved with Prialt. You can also try mixing the opiates with other meds and see if a cocktail of various meds help. I am pretty sure you have already tried that. Take care, Annette""I would make an appt. to speak with the doctor personally. Lay out all your questions and write down all his answers. Really think about what you want to do as far as the SCS goes. Tell the doctor if you really want to have it or not. I am not sure if you are committed to this whole process or not. Take care, Annette""Kadian and Avinza are both morphine in long acting form. I used a generic long acting morphine for many years, 10 , it worked great. Did they increase the mg. or change the hours between doses? Did they change the BT meds? I don<APO>t remember what you were taking before. If all they did was change the brand from Avinza to Kadian, but left the rest the same, I would go back promptly if it doesn<APO>t help. I personally do not believe one brand is any better than another. If they increased the dose in mg. or ar giving it to you more often, it will probably work. I agree with you about the SCS, I have not seen enough evidence that it really helps to try it out. Same with the implanted pump, I would have to run out of oral med options to even consider them. Take care, Annette""When you said you were on Avinza before, do you mean just before changing to Kadian, or in the distant past? If you have been off of opiates for awhile, you would probably respond to a much lower dose than if you have been on them continuously. Take care, Annette""I am not sure where all you have gotten your info up to now. Methadone and other opioids are commonly used for all kinds of pain including neuropathic pain. I have read in one or two sources that methadone may have a slight edge on other opioids for treating neuropathic pain, but not to the point that the others do not work at all. As a nurse, I have given all kinds of opioids to patients with many kinds of pain with varying response. In my personal experience methadone works for both neurologic pain and pain caused by other problems. My husband took it for hip pain while he was waiting for a hip replacement surgery due to another medical problem. I now take it for pain related to a neurological problem. I used to take morphine and switched due to financial reasons with my insurance company. Both drugs work fine for me. Methadone worked well for my husband and he tapered off without any problem at all after he had the hip replaced. No withdrawals at all. This was also my experience when I worked many years ago in a heroin treatment facility where we used methadone as one treatment. Methadone has a half life of 8-59 hours according to my drug manual for nurses, by the way. Much more than you mentioned in your post above for most people. Some people take methadone every 12 hours for chronic pain, some every 8 hours, depends on their response. During the initial period of use the dosing may be different than once they have adjusted to it. The dose may be lowered after 3-5 days to avoid CNS changes as the drug accumulates in the system with time due to the long half life of the drug. This drug is more complicated to dose than the other opiates due to the long half life. I would see a doctor who has a lot of experience prescribing it. I read the article you provided a link to. I am not sure I agree entirely. It was an interesting read. Thanks for posting the link. Take care, Annette""I did not mean to make you feel defensive. I just wondered where you got your info, that is all. We all come from a different background. The article you posted a link to discussed the general treatment of neuropathic pain. They mentioned using drugs like morphine for neuropathic pain. I discussed that at the beginning of my post to you, the rest was my personal experience with methadone. I personally rarely go to WebMD for research information, I tend to use Medscape. I found an error at WebMD some years ago regarding basilar migraine treatment, and emailed them. They admitted the error, but said they could not change it because they were under contract with the author. They give good general information for the most part, but I prefer evidence based studies with a bit more information. I live in Oregon, previously in NV, and Calif. I never felt the DEA was right behind my doctors, nor did they. Here in Oregon we have guidelines for the doctors to follow for prescribing opiates to chronic pain patients, and as long as they do, the doctors I have spoken to, have told me they do not feel under a microscope. I have never had any real difficulty in getting the treatment I need for my pain. You and I have different experiences, but I feel both are valuable. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I missed this post last night, I thought you would have had the test by now. I will think good thoughts for you on Monday. Bummer to have to go all weekend waiting for it. I am sure it will be fine though. Take care, Annette""I had a CT myelogram in the morning and went to work that evening at 7PM for a 12 hour shift in the ER as an RN. I suggest you follow the doctor<APO>s instructions, and drink lots of fluids (without caffeine). I didn<APO>t have a headache, and I am prone to migraines. Take care, Annette PS, By this time you have already had the test and are probably doing fine.""I have FMS, but do not have any nausea. I haven<APO>t read of nausea being connected to FMS, but you might go to http://www.myalgia.com to read more about FMS. Maybe it will shed some light. Take care, Annette""I was sure I had read as much. Print out the article and take it to your doctor and see what he says. I would do it at an appt. where you sit face to face in an exam room. Best of luck. Take care, Annette""There are a number of different types of tests done. Often in doctors<APO> offices they use an immunoassay test on urine. If there is a postivie result they should do a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to confirm any results. They should do that on the same specimen to determine if the original test was accurate. I have read the same thing that BrenBren said, but I cannot remember where. I find that research on http://pain-topics.org often leads to solid information. Take care, Annette""I would suggest you go read the articles at http://www.myalgia.com and see if they offer you any help at all. There is lots of good medical info there about how to deal with FMS. Take care, Annette""Sorry that you are in the situation that you find yourself in. I would suggest you sign a release for your medical records, and pick them up yourself. This way you are certain to have them with you for the doctor to look at. It is very unlikely that the records, scans, etc. will all get to the office for your appt., at least in my experience. Take care, Annette""I am not familiar with this illness personally. I would suggest you try seeing a pain management specialist that uses a wide variety of different kinds of pain management techniques (not just injections and procedures). Perhaps they can at least help you deal with the pain. Take care, Annette""I would get a mammogram and a clinical breast exam by your doctor, just to ease your mind. It is not uncommon to have one breast larger than the other. I am not sure how you could weigh them accurately. Seminolernp gave you things to check for, lumps, discharge, etc. Take care, Annette""I married a man that was told he had only six months to live due to lymphoma. He stopped treatments when he moved in with me and my 9 year old son. We all discussed it, but it was his decision. He was tired of being sick and did not wish to go on with treatments that made him feel sicker. He was 6<APO>3"" and weighed 145 pounds. After several months, and no death in sight, we got married, he decided to find a job, and went to work. That was 20 years ago, he just retired at age 65. The lymphoma went away, no known medical reason. He had one hip replaced about 18 months ago. He is very stoic about pain for the most part. He had AVN in the head of the femur, and the doctor said it was like he was walking on a broken hip. Yet, he did that for nearly two years, with a golf club upside down for a cane... I didn<APO>t get ill till about ten years into our marriage. He does UNDERSTAND. But, no one KNOWS how we feel. That is a personal thing. I recognize that I am not dying, though sometimes I have wished I would due to the pain. To me chronic pain is NOT worse than a death sentence. Every day my husband tells me to get more rest, sleep when I need to. The housework does not matter to him. He helps me when I need it. He does all the cooking. I am truly blessed with having him for a partner in life. My siblings, best friends, and son know I can<APO>t do everything I used to do, and I have pain, but I don<APO>t really share with them as much of the details. I don<APO>t want to. Life is good. Take care, Annette""Hi, Gail My husband fell a few years back off a truck at work, he had a non-healing wound from the fall. He had multiple Staph infections, though not MRSA. They were afraid of osteomyelitis in his leg also. He had an MRI done and it didn<APO>t show anything, but the infectious disease doc we were seeing said that was common, and it was best to do the 6-8 weeks of IV antibiotics anyway. He did. They put a Groshong catheter into his chest, they often use a PICC line in your arm, but he didn<APO>t want to miss that much work so the line in his chest was easier for him to manage at work. Either one is good. We did the antibiotics at home, I did anyway, he just laid there, lol. It worked out fine, he ended up needing surgery on a damaged vein in that leg, it finally healed up and he had his opposite hip replaced, end of story. No more infections. I hope your IV antibiotics go as smoothly as his did and help with your problem. I am so glad that you and your family are working together to address your health issues. My son is far away, so I only see them once a year at Xmas when I fly down there. There are times, like every time I leave to go see him or friends, that I almost convince myself that it will be too hard. I really have to force myself to leave home, but once I do, things go okay, everyone is kind and works around my limitations. I have to rest up and recover after I get home, usually for several weeks, but it is worth it. Mu husband and I have both been married before and agreed that divorce is too hard to go through again. I told him it will be death before divorce this time, and he agreed, I may kill him but I won<APO>t divorce him, lol. Just kidding. Hugs, Annette""Just know that I will be thinking of you. Hugs, Annette""We aren<APO>t doctors, please go have it checked out. Maintain that 20 year old body so when you are my age, 59, it isn<APO>t completely worn out. Thank you so much for your service. My son was a Marine for 8 years. It is a tough life. Take care, Annette""Why do you feel this is due to the fentanyl? Has your doctor or pharmacist suggested this? Have you seen a neurologist for this limb jerking yet? Take care, Annette PS, I like the formalities, most people give more info that way.""I would suggest you see both a neurologist and a neurosurgeon before you make any decisions about surgery. Get all the necessary imaging tests done. The ulnar nerve goes from your spine down to your hand and branches into your fingers. Who did the study you had done? Was this a tech of a neurologist? I have had spinal surgery on my neck once and I would do as I did then and try all other options prior to thinking about surgery. The second time I had a herniated disc in my neck I opted not to have surgery, and after a year or two, things ended up about the same as when I had surgery. I don<APO>t know if your problem can heal without surgery or not, just try whatever else you can early on. Do not put your arm in a sling unless a neurologist tells you to and fits you and explains how to manage it. You can do permanent damage to your elbow by immobilizing it. Take care, Annette""DDD is the medical abbreviation for degenerative disc disease. Take care, Annette""You need to follow up with your own doctor after you get out of the hospital. Having one bowel movement every two weeks is not close to normal. Pain meds can increase constipation. The doctor has to examine you and figure this one out. Take care, Annette""Using oxygen via mask or nasal cannula for cluster headaches is common practice where I have worked as an RN. It helps some patients. No one seems to be sure why. I have known patients who had oxygen canisters at home and would hook themselves up as needed. You need a doctors RX for oxygen at home for medical purposes, I believe. I have not heard of using 100% oxygen therapy as a tool in a normal labor setting. Best of luck to your friends with their baby. Take care, Annette""Glad to be of help. Take care, Annette""Sorry you have so much going on. I have had chronic pain for about 15-20 years now but have avoided any kind of invasive injections or procedures so far. Let us know how it turns out for you. Take care, Annette""Just ask your doctor about it. They have heard everything, so you should not feel any embarrassment about it. That is their job. As far as the poll goes, there is no ""normal"", everyone is different for a variety of reasons. If your desire differs radically from your wife<APO>s and you can<APO>t come to a mutually satisfying compromise, you should both get checked out by your doctors to make certain there is no health issue, medication side effect, etc. After that, if it is still an issue go to a therapist together. This is a fixable problem if you are both willing to talk about it. Wish I could help with the pain issue. Take care, Annette""He will either go to a doctor and find out about this, or he won<APO>t. I would just leave it in his court. A regular family doctor is one place to start. If you don<APO>t require a referral, then a urologist might be useful. Take care, Annette""Hi, Joe Please find one doctor and stick with him/her. There are many different things going on with you and having one doctor makes it easier to figure it all out. If you were put on blood pressure pills for high blood pressure, you should not have just stopped taking it because it didn<APO>t seem to help. High blood pressure is a serious problem and does not cause pain or anything until you have a heart attack, stroke, or kidney failure. It is called the ""silent killer"" for a reason. You need a regular doctor so they can check your blood pressure regularly and adjust the medicine as needed as well as figure out what is causing your pain. They may be unrelated. You know you need to quit smoking, find the right time for you and see what you can do about that. If you need help, there are lots of things the doctor can prescribe to help you in that endeavor. Take care, Annette""Hi, BrenBren I have never used the fentanyl patch as I adore my hot tub, and the two are not compatible. I think everyone has their own favorite meds, but I have not found any reliable studies that show any one long acting opioid is better than another when used properly. I used generic long acting morphine for over ten years, with generic norco for BT pain. It worked fine. I am now using methadone instead, with generic norco for BT pain. Due to a better deal on my Medicare Part D insurance, I will avoid the dreaded donut hole this way. It works fine too. I feel it is in part positive thinking on my part, I have no preconceived notions about meds not working for me. I assume they will work, until proven otherwise. I am sorry I cannot give you personal experience of the kind you need. I think with the right attitude and dosing you will do fine whatever med you take. Take care, Annette""Swank explained the norco thing. I do fine on methadone, as well or better than on morphine. I don<APO>t worry about stopping breathing while on it, as I started low and increased very slowly until I got good relief. That is something that usually happens as you increase the dose. I am on a relatively low dose, it works for me. I have been on a stable dose for 5 months now, I don<APO>t think dying in my sleep is part of the deal. My husband was on it for a couple of years, and I tapered him off after he had his hip replaced and he asked me to. I fill his daily pill boxes for him. I did it slowly over a few weeks, and he did fine, no withdrawal symptoms at all. I did it a bit differently than what you describe though. His doctor knew I had dealt with it in a previous nursing job and said to just do it however we wanted to. Have you discussed your taper with your doctor? Now that you are down to 10 mg. a day, you might discuss with him breaking each tablet in half or even in quarters, and going more slowly from 10 to nothing. Talk to your doctor about the whole thing. If you still need pain meds, you might discuss with him the level that will give you better function. If you don<APO>t want to be on them at all, then discuss with him how to best taper off entirely. if you really do not feel comfortable on the methadone, then ask for a different med. Take care, Annette""A letter in narrative form from your old doctor is usually helpful also. He can dictate a brief summary, like they do for SSDI, finishing with your diagnosis and treatment plan. I do keep old records, MRIs, etc. of my own, I can share them as needed with newer doctors. Great suggestions. Take care, Annette""Great suggestions!! I have had chronic pain for over 15 years now. I think once an ER doctor treated me like a drug addict, he did not take any time to see me, and told the nurse to give me whatever I wanted. It was my first trip for pain, in a strange hospital ER, I really did not know what to say. After that, I acted ""stupid"" about drug abuse, just told the doctor what I was on like it was blood pressure medicine. That seemed to work. We do see alot of drug seekers in the ER, I worked there for many years as an RN. I also worked in a heroin addiction treatment center, so I have seen chronic pain and I have seen addiction. I would rather have chronic pain myself. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I have had migraines for many years. One only gets dehydrated if one waits a long time to go to the ER, nowadays we know to get treatment as soon as the migraine starts. Not every one gets nausea with a headache, although it is common. Same with heart rate and blood pressure, they go up in some folks and stay the same in others. Where do you get a baseline BP when you see the patient in the ER, you don<APO>t always have a history with VS to compare it with. My family doctor saw me when my migraines were at their worst and happened to see me during a headache and he said he could tell by looking in my eyes and seeing the retinal arteries, but even that only happens sometimes. I have 40 years of experience as an RN, over 12 years in the ER. I have learned that headaches, like any chronic pain, are exactly what the patient says they are. No one with any amount of medical experience can tell how much pain someone else is having. Only the patient can tell you that. Patients sometimes lie, well or badly. We can only guess the truth. I will love it if we ever have a written down, test for pain, chronic and acute. At this point we don<APO>t, at least not that I am aware of. If you have had a problem with a particular staff member, write a letter to the head nurse, same if you have an exceptionally good visit, write letters, send emails, but do document it, and if the visit was bad, ask for someone else if you wish to. Take care, Annette""I agree with the poster who said once or twice a year is not a frequent flyer. I worked the ER as an RN, ""frequent flyers"" is a derogatory name for folks that come to the ER much more often than that. They often came to multiple hospitals in one day, as many as eight a day. I have had migraines for many years, since I went off the birth control pills at 35, I am nearly 63 now. Part of your problem is your own attitude and part is the caregiver<APO>s problem. Why do you hate it when they ask what works for you? This is a good thing, there are lots of different ways to treat acute migraines, of course, they should ask you this question, if you don<APO>t know say so. It is also normal for many of us to hate that question, we feel guilty and bad. Instead, think of it like you have high blood pressure, there are lots of different treatments, and it is important for them to know what you have tried and what works well for you. I would always tell them that a particular non-narcotic IV med worked best for me. As soon as they determined I did not want ""drugs"", they relaxed and partook of my personal experience. Treat them like associates, share with them and do not feel ashamed, there is no reason to feel that way. Opiates are not the best treatment for migraines, drug seekers don<APO>t know that yet. I do recall when that was all we had for folks with migraines, sedate them enough to sleep through the headaches. That was the plan. Now we have all kinds of good treatments to try out that actually work. Please do not wait until your headaches is rally bad to go to the ER, all the medical information says the earlier the headache is treated the better. I know how hard that is to do, but try it and see. Take care, Annette""Hi, Lisa I don<APO>t feel anyone should be made to feel bad about themselves in the ER. However, it is not the place to go to get quick, efficient care for a chronic condition. ERs are to treat emergencies, heart attacks and strokes, and accidents, bleeding, etc. When you arrive the first nurse who sees you is usually the triage nurse, who takes your vital signs like your temp and B/P. She decides if you are an emergency or not, and puts you in line to see the doctor or the PA. As a chronic patient you go to the area that is most suited to your case. I think you should follow up with your letter to the administration of the hospital, no one should trat a person badly in the ER, you already feel sick. Do you have a pcp, a pain management doctor, or a rheumatologist for your FMS pain? They are the kind of doctors to seek out. Develope a plan with your doctor for what to do if your pain gets out of control. Many people have FMS and work out a plan for what to do for their pain and what to do if it flares so they don<APO>t have to get up and go to the ER. It works, I know because I do that. Take care, Annette""I agree with you. My ER had a ""Fast Track"" system that put patients who did not have emergencies into an urgent care kind of area with separate staff that dealt with chronic conditions. Not all ERs have this kind of a system. ERs just are not equipped to do massive amounts of diagnostic work on conditions that have been diagnosed for months or years just because the patient wants another doctor to diagnose them. ER docs are trained and board certified to quickly diagnose and treat illnesses and trauma that can threaten ones life or limbs. The one thing that they do correctly, is in my experience they always give the patient the name of a doctor to follow up with. For this reason I wonder why folks seem to want to go to the ER repeatedly for the same problem rather than see the doctor they were referred to at the end of their last ER visit. If lack of money or no insurance is the problem, I have no answer for that other than going to the nearest free clinic. Until the US has universal health care we are stuck with the current insurance system. But, don<APO>t complain about the ER doctors, do something to change the system. Take care, Annette""Doctors will be thrilled when a lab test is developed that tells them when a person is really in pain. It will eliminate all the nonsense they have to listen to. The hand held breathalizer eliminated arguing with folks about how much they had had to drink in the ER, a pain monitor of some sort would be welcomed. At least 8 out of 10 doctors that I worked with over the years took the patient<APO>s word for it if they said they were in pain, at least for the first visit. After, that they had to judge by the patient<APO>s behaviour. You just can<APO>t do that with a person on the first visit when you don<APO>t know them at all. The cops hated our ER because we were known as the ER to go to get drugs among addicts, but we wanted to make certain that we did not turn away folks in pain untreated. It is a two headed coin. Take care, Annette""I didn<APO>t say that the ER doctor or nurse was not equipped or able to deal with chronic pain, I said, to be exact, that ""ERs just are not equipped to do massive amounts of diagnostic work on conditions that have been diagnosed for months or years just because the patient wants another doctor to diagnose them."" This has to do with MRI machines that are not always available in all ERs in the middle of the night, especially in smaller hospitals, and the fact that many diagnostic labs take hours to run and may not even be available while the patient is still in the ER. My comment was all about making a diagnosis of what is causing the pain, not treating the pain itself. Take care, Annette""I apologize completely. I don<APO>t need to reread what you or she wrote, I believe you. Of course, you have the right to say anything you wish. Everyone does. I remembered writing about ERs not being ""equipped"" or trained and assumed wrongly that you were talking about my post. I am the first one to say so when I have misunderstood. There are four pages of posts under this heading and I got confused about who was answering who. Again, I apologize. Take care, Annette""Drug allergies.... I would suggest that you do not put on the chart that you are allergic to NSAIDs if you are not actually allergic to them. Tell the nurse when she asks about allergies that you have a kidney condition that precludes you from taking them, but you are not actually allergic to them all. Then tell her which ones have actually given you an allergic reaction. A drug allergy means that you break out in hives when you take that drug, or you develop swelling, throat tightness, shortness of breath, etc. If the drug makes you nauseated, or have a stomach ache, etc., that is not an allergy, that is a side effect. Just as good a reason not to take that drug, but don<APO>t say it is an allergy. Explain that later if the doctor suggests prescribing one. This way the doctor does not see you with pre-concieved ideas about addiction and drug allergies. He can get to know you a bit first. Take care, Annette""This reply was to the original poster, anonymous<UD>28464. These can be confusing sometimes. Take care, Annette""Hi, Anon<UD>2912, RSD is far worse than FMS as far as I am concerned. I have FMS, and have had patients with RSD. They are completely different pain conditions though. Not even related. Take care, Annette""Gail has searched far and wide for relief for her pain. RSD is a complex pain syndrome, difficult to treat successfully. If caught and diagnosed early on, nerve blocks and intensive PT might help. Sometimes it goes away for no apparent reason. Some people have even had the body part that is affected amputated hoping that the pain will go away. Mostly, people take a lot of drugs and get minimal relief. RSD is one of the illnesses that nurses don<APO>t wish on anyone. This world is backwards in many ways. Take care, Annette""I think having the hospital social worker help you was a great idea. Some hospitals also have pain management teams now. As far as I know all doctors have to have a DEA number to prescribe controlled substances, with the exception of doctors who work for the VA. I only found out about that, when I volunteered with a bunch of VA doctors at a free clinic for folks without health insurance. The VA runs its own game for some reason. I have never actually met a doctor (other than the VA docs) who did not have a DEA number and practiced in the three states where I have been a nurse. I know the DEA occasionally suspends or revokes a doctor<APO>s certification and then a doctor may not prescribe controlled substances, but usually those doctors stop practicing medicine. It is really hard to practice medicine properly without prescribing any controlled substances. Take care, Annette""Migraines are something you have to learn to live with, I know from experience. Pain pumps and opiates are not really effective management tools for migraines. You didn<APO>t say how many headaches you get a month or what rescue meds you are currently using. Write down all your concerns about your headaches, keep a journal that says when they start and stop, what time you take your meds, what foods you eat, your sleep patterns, etc. All this will help you work with your doctor more effectively. Do your own research, read a lot on medical sites like Medscape, or pain.com. If your doctor gets to the end of his bag of tricks, then get a referral to a headache specialist. It can take a couple of years of consistently trying new meds, doses, schedules, etc. to get headaches under control. I know I got frustrated and would stop seeing the doctor for long periods of time because I figured he had nothing else to offer. But, once I settled in with one doctor and really worked at it, we found treatment plans that made the migraines bearable. You will too, just keep at it. Take care, Annette""Don<APO>t worry too much, my son had one when he was a teenager, he did self exams as I had taught him, and felt a lump. We got him right in to our doctor and they did an ultrasound and made the diagnosis. He has never had to do anything about it, he just checks for any changes. He is in his 30s now. A varicocele is good news. Take care, Annette""Four tylenol at a time is still too much for one dose. 1,000 mg is the max for one dose, especially without a doctor following your liver tests to make sure you aren<APO>t doing damage. 4,000 mg. per day is the maximum recommended dose. You do the math. One should not drink at all while taking tylenol on a regular basis. It will kill your liver. You have a wonderful education, but addicts/alcoholics come in all shapes and colors, and socio-economic groups. Few of them are capable of self diagnosis until it is too late. If you are not an alcoholic, just stop drinking along with the tylenol. If you have truly been well educated about alcohol and how it works, then you know it does not improve real, deep sleep or decrease pain. It may help you fall asleep, but you do not get into the deep stages of sleep that restore your body. And after awhile it wears off after about two hours, and you need to drink more to sleep through the night. I am not saying that opiates may not be the best choice for you, I am saying that the present way you are presenting your history would make any medical person nervous about prescribing them, with good reason. Take care, Annette""I hope you don<APO>t find yourself without a doctor to manage your meds. It is a difficult position to be in. Take care, Annette""Good plan, the only thing with bringing them yourself is that some doctors think the records may have been altered if a patient brings them in. You might consider not opening the envelope they arrive at your home in, hand them to the new doctor so he can unseal them. That way he knows they are the way the sending doctor sent them. I will hope for the best for you. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t expect any doctor to trust me the first appt. I don<APO>t trust him the first time I meet him either. I think for me it takes about three appts. before I know just what the doctor is like, and I imagine it would take him that long too. I have had all my old doctors send me a copy of my records, but I also have them sent to the new doctor directly. I take my copy with me just in case he hasn<APO>t gotten his yet, or hasn<APO>t read it. Some doctors do not read records before they see a patient, as they want to go in without any preconceived ideas about what might be wrong. Then after they see the patient, they look at the records. Everyone has their own way of doing things, whatever works for you. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I have had migraines for over 15 years, opiates are not recommended for treatment for migraines because the opiates don<APO>t work well for migraine pain and can cause rebound headaches. Only after all other treatment possibilities had been tried would it be medically correct to use opiates, and then they are not likely to work. It would take at least a couple of years to try all the other migraine meds alone and in pairs in adequate time frames before you got to opiates. It would be great if they did work, it would make migraines relatively easy to treat. Take care, Annette""Are you using a splint for your typing? You might consider having an occupational therapist evaluate your work station for changes to make it easier on your wrist. An OC did wonders for my pain at work back in the day. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I became a nurse in 1970 and there were plenty of drug addicts out there already. That was before Jesse was born. People have been abusing opiates since they were invented. I don<APO>t blame doctors for being skeptical, they have to deal with and treat all kinds of people with all kinds of problems, both those who need opiates for their chronic pain and those who need treatment for their opiate addiction. Both have real illnesses that require very different treatment. I don<APO>t feel it is the ""average person"" vs. the ""real people who need the pain medication to live a normal life"". Addicts are no more ""bad apples"" than we are. Addiction is very difficult to treat successfully, I would much rather be a chronic pain patient than an addict. Take care, Annette""Sorry, but maybe it is because this post is right beneath the one where you say you are drinking a lot and use pain pills from a friend, etc., etc. that this does not sound like ""full disclosure"". This letter sounds just like a letter from a drug abuser looking for opiates trying to find a short cut to get them on the first visit. All the key phrases are there. I<APO>m sorry, I am just being honest. I would just go to the pain management doctor, let him do his job and examine you and look at the MRI, old records, etc. Then ask for help getting relief from pain so you can do the PT that the other doctor suggested. Did you tell the doctor that suggested you increase your ulcer meds with the NSAIDs that you have also been drinking ""an awful lot lately"" at least up to a week ago? Could that have anything to do with your ulcer problems? By the way, taking the meds and selling them is not a myth. My brother was approached outside the ER where he had been a patient and offered $$$ at $10 per pill for a vicodin RX he had just been given. He needed them and did not sell them, but it does happen. That was years ago, nothing new. Good luck in getting the help you need. Try looking the doctor in the eye and being very honest about the whole thing. Letters in advance like the one you wrote above only warn the doctor to never even see you. Take care, Annette""You are clearly being medically informed at this time, because you KNOW that mixing alcohol and the quantity of tylenol that you are taking can kill you. You are adding someone else<APO>s opiates to this mix. You already know what it is like to be on opiates, because you are on them now. If I were a doctor, I would be very hesitant to give someone with that history opiates. You are already mixing substances in a dangerous manner, and using illegal drugs. By the way, being young and appearing healthy and complaining of pain is not the profile for drug addicts/abusers. You said you had a doctor prescribe fentanyl patches for your ulcer pain when you were 20, it shouldn<APO>t be that hard to find a doctor to prescribe opiates for legitimate pain. Why would you have to drive to Florida now that you actually have a medically documented history of an orthopedic surgery and reinjury and are only asking for opiates to cover the pain of PT for a limited amount of time?? You certainly have the right to choose to be an addict, but you do not have the right to decide a doctor should risk his hard earned medical license to help you become an addict. Addiction is much harder to cure than most orthodepic injuries are, I doubt you would say such a thing if you really knew what addicts go through. Take care, Annette""If the tylenol doesn<APO>t work in less than 4,000 mg/day doses, it probably won<APO>t work in larger doses, but it may cause fatal liver damage. Please don<APO>t bother taking that much of it, unless you are supervised by a doctor and having lever function tests regularly. Take care, Annette""In reading about doctors who get caught up by the DEA, it seems that it is often because doctors do not keep adequate records to document the need for opioids by their patients, and the fact that the drugs are improving the life of these patients. I think if doctors take the time to write notes appropriately it can really protect them. When doctors are investigated, the DEA reads their medical records to check for these things in addition to the doses of meds given and what kind of patients got the RXs. Usually the DEA sends in undercover agents posing as patients to see how easy it is to get RXs from the doctors for controlled substances, but that is only one criteria they use when deciding what doctors need to be disciplined. Doctors who are practicing correctly have little to worry about, the DEA can tell that and gives them warnings about what they need to improve in their paperwork and how. Then they give them time to make those improvements. The percentage of doctors who actually are disciplined or lose their licenses in regard to their prescription of controlled substances is VERY tiny when compared to the number of doctors who are practicing medicine. Some doctors get very greedy, and run patient mills where they see a patient for a couple of minutes once a month, give them RXs and see another. Or they have nurse practitioners see their patients for them and just sign RXs, if they have several NPs working for them, they can charge a lot of money in one day. This happened in my area recently, but it was a pain clinic run entirely by NPs. They did not keep records up because they really did not get any info from their patients, and did not do exams. You make a lot of money that way, but you do not practice good medicine. I am a nurse, but once I read why they were arrested, and how the investigation was carried out, it sounded okay by me. They did lose their licenses. I am not saying your doctor works that way, or all doctors who have NPs work that way, but a few do. They ruin it for all the good doctors and NPs. You only read about the bad ones in the news, not the good ones. I am glad to hear that your doctors did not lose their licenses. I hope the local news put that on the air too, not just when they got investigated. Take care, Annette""The problem I see is that he is STILL in pain even though he is taking too much tylenol AND drinking too much alcohol. Alcohol does not fix physical pain anyway. If he is still in pain and he knows the dangers of taking tylenol in that quantitiy (never mind doing it along with alcohol with a history of severe ulcer disease), then he may not doing it for pain anymore, but for something else. Having a problem with alcohol that you cannot stop even with negative consequences is a bad sign for someone who also wants opiates. Just my opinion. Which is why I say leave it up to doctors who can actually see him, and his medical records, and the whole picture. Take care, Annette""I looked up Dr. Hurwitz, his original conviction was overturned on appeal, and he was convicted at a second trial of 16 counts of drug trafficking in 2007, he was sentenced to five years and nine months. There was no mention of another appeal. Back when the original trial was on and his web site was still available, I visited it. He had a conviction coming just based on what I read. He ran an office that did not accept insurance, charged huge amounts of money monthly even when you were not in to see him. He was making a fortune off of pain patients. Annette""Sorry, it was four years and nine months. Take care, Anentte""As long as you are happy with the doctor<APO>s attention, I would not worry, but it sounds like you have some legitimate concerns. He should not check off anything he has not done on a checklist. Many specialists do not do certain things that they feel are in the job description of your pcp, things like your weight and BP, but if your pain meds can alter these things I feel they should be watching them, so I cannot comment directly. I also have a concern about the NPs interrupting your appt. to get RXs signed. I think that is your time, you pay for it, and he should sign RXs that they can<APO>t sign between his other appts. I would speak up and tell the doctor that I find the interruption disconcerting, and in future could they wait until our time has passed. See what happens, if he respects your limits. I also would not worry about what happened at just one visit, but if it was a pattern with him, I would sit down and ask him directly why he doesn<APO>t seem to be doing reassessments often enough, and why not? He may have a good answer I don<APO>t know. After that, if things do not change and you feel uncomfortable with this doctor you have to decide if you want to change doctors. Often it just takes open communication with a doctor as to what the patient<APO>s expectations are. Sometimes they are just jerks though. Take care, Annette""I would suggest you give a doctor enough time and enough appts. to get to know each other and decide if you can work together. You said you had one appt. with each of four different doctors (plus three ER visits) and the four all filled your RXs. There is really nothing wrong with a doctor questioning your intentions as long as they accept your response to that question. If these doctors continued to question you regardless of your answers, I can understand your problem with them, but I for one would stick with one doctor for several visits and see if I could convince them of my sincerity. I had an internist once who treated me that way, but after three visits he offered to manage my pain with opiates. We got along fine from then on. I opted to continue to see him, but had my rheumy take care of my pain management for FMS. He turned out to be a great guy and a good doctor. He managed my migraine treatment and did a great job of it. I have been a nurse for about forty years now and I have not had the experience that you and others complain of with 99% of the doctors I have been to see. I hope you find someone that makes you more comfortable. Take care, Annette""As far as work and gettting time off to go to the doctor and PT, MRI appts. etc. you might sign up for FMLA. You can use it for intermittant or all at once use. You may have to use all your vacation/sick time first, that depends on the meployer. FMLA time off is unpaid otherwise, but at least it protects your job. Check your employment contract, if you are a salaried employee, your benefits are different than if you are paid hourly. Hourly people in my experience always get their checks docked if they are not on the job, salaried people it depends how many hours per week you are being paid for. I don<APO>t know why you have to get a new MRI every 2 years, I haven<APO>t had one for about ten years, if you don<APO>t need one, why get one? Call your state board of pharmacy to ask about any new laws going into effect in Florida. It just sounds crazy to me that anyone would actually change a law so everyone on opiates would need RXs every three days. There are federal laws that have all kinds of rules about opiates, I think this would conflict with some of them. Doctors would hate it as they have no time to write that many RXs per patient for folks who are on daily opiates, they keep laws from being changes because they have a fair amount of power. Patients would hate it too. Where did you hear about it? Don<APO>t believe everything you hear until you check it out with the folks who should really know. Take care, Annette""I would still call the state office that deals with pharmacy matters and ask them exactly what the new law says. This is a newspaper article that is quoting what someone they interviewed said, not always reliable. This is according to the article a state law, the FDA and DEA are federal agencies so they would not have impacted on this. My pharmacists have always asked me what I am taking my pain meds for, I consider them a part of my health care team, and do not have any problem discussing my health issues with them. One pharmacist I used to have in another state used to actually do research for me on line to help me find medicines that might help me with other chronic issues. He was an angel in my book. On the other hand, NO one puts their hands in my purse, not even my husband. If boss ever did, he might have to bandage his bloody stumps, lol. My mom taught me that a woman<APO>s purse and a man<APO>s wallet are PRIVATE, my husband<APO>s mom taught him the same thing. I have never gotten $$ out of his wallet even if he tells me to, I take it to him and he gives it to me. Same with my purse, he would never put his hands in it. We have been happily married for over 20 years now. I can<APO>t even imagine that, good for you, leaving it in your car was very smart of you. Take care, Annette""They are not a narcotic, they contain lidocaine, a local anesthetic. I have used them, and they do help certain kinds of pain. They are just one of the tools I use to help control pain. Take care, Annette""I would continue with the Pain Management doctor and find another pulmonary doc, lol. You are not taking anything unusual for chronic pain, as long as you are taking it exactly the way it was ordered. I would ignore the insurance company<APO>s letter. They just want to make sure all your doctors know about all your medicines, and that you are following any contracts you made with the doctors to only get opiates from one doctor, etc. In some states it is a felony to get opiates from multiple doctors and not tell each doctor about the others, so be very careful in that regard. Take care, Annette""The nerve that goes from the spine down the arm, eventually gets to the hand and fingers. The nerve that deal with the hands leaves the spinal cord in the cervical spine, your neck. I never had pain in my neck with my DDD of the cervical spine. I only had pain in my shoulder, arms, and hands and loss of fuction in my fingers, I would drop stuff. The pain started behind my shoulder blade and ran up into my shoulder and down my arm to my fingers. Pay attention to which fingers are affected, this can help the doctor figure out where to look for problems in the neck, as different nerves from the neck ennervate certain fingers. Take care, Annette""Has anyone checked your cervical spine (neck)? I lost the use of my fine motor skills in my fingers of my right hand. I was dropping stuff all the time. It was a herniated disc in my neck found on an MRI of my neck. Take care, Annette""Pain in the back or neck may be unrelated to the changes in the hands/fingers. I never had any neck pain at all, just changes in function and later some numbness and pain in my arm and in my hand. Best of luck on the 2nd. Take care, Annette""In my experience as an ER nurse, I would give toradol about a 90% success rate for decreasing pain in folks with kidney stones. That doesn<APO>t mean it would work for you, just my experience with ten years worth of ER experience when we used it. Take care, Annette""They have mostly stopped using Demerol due to the metabolites that it breaks down into once it is in the body. They can quickly cause seizures, there does not seem to be any way to tell just when that will happen after two doses, or four doses, or even one dose. Because of this, they have not made a long acting Demerol in the US that I am aware of. I truly believe that it is mostly a matter of dosing the opioid correctly to get the correct effect. I still have not read any good studies that show any one opioid is better than another. Many side effects go away if you stick with the drug for a few weeks or months. Take care, Annette""The ER docs I worked with many years ago used IV toradol in patients with kidney stones, and it worked amazingly well in most patients. Far better than morphine. The doctors gave it themselves for many years until it was approved for this use, then the nurses gave it IV. Take care, Annette""From what I understand, it is the cumulative effect of the two meds, the short acting and the long acting, working together that get you over the hump of breakthrough pain. I personally have used a generic of hydrocodone/APAP 10/325 BT pain, for the whole time I have been on long acting meds 10 years. It is considered one of the weaker opiates, but has continued to work fine as my long term meds were increased and then changed entirely. I have increased the dose of the BT meds also over the ten years, but only once. Everyone is different, and will react to meds differently at different times in their lives. I would just discuss this with your PM doctor and see what he says. I think how you respond to your meds is the important thing. It may have worked fine in the past, but since your pain levels are not being treated properly now, tell the doctor. He may increase or change either or both your short and long acting meds. Take care, Annette""I am so glad your pcp gave you some samples and at least a start on medicines to relieve your pain. I would not deal with any PM doctor who has staff that argue with you about being compliant when you have not even seen the doctor yet. I hope the first one works out for you. Do keep in mind that when you choose one gender over the other for doctors you are putting aside half the possibilities. I assume you have a good reason for this, but keep in mind that you can cover that at the initial interview and if the doctor is not respectful of your feelings you can cross him off the list then. I have had both female and male doctors, my current pcp that manages all my care including pain management is a female, she is great. Best of luck, and get a good night<APO>s sleep. Take care, Annette""I just happen to have found my great female doc when I moved here. I am an old RN and have seen many of each gender, both good and bad. Many people have very personal reasons for seeing a female doctor, I would never just tell anyone to see a male doctor without understanding why they have their preference. Sometimes it is due to a religious preference, sometimes for other reasons like rape or assault. Do what is right for you, if you don<APO>t find a good female doc after awhile, try male doctors again, lol. Be patient about getting better, it may take awhile. I am glad you slept better just before a big presentation and that it went well. My dear DIL also works full time and goes to college at night, I don<APO>t know how she does it and takes such good care of her family too. I am always well, I ignore the pain, lol. Take care, Annette""I recently re-read parts of the Big Book of AA, they are the ones who are all for the higher power thing, and have tried to make it all inclusive to include non-believers. (However, it does say that all the agnostics and atheists will likely become Christians once the AA way of life fixes their alcoholism.) What you are saying sounds like what they say about a higher power. I do not think that a belief in justice or kindness, etc. is believing in a higher power. I do consider a higher power as a deity of some kind, something who has the power to make changes in the world at its whim. We are all free to believe as we choose to. You and I do not have to agree on this. Some people do not believe in a higher power of any kind. My dad was one. He was a fine, moral man who simply did not believe in a god of any kind, including any kind of higher power. He felt we were all fine people and could attain whatever we chose to work hard for. So, in my humble opinion, including a higher power rather than saying ""God"", still leaves out some people. Take care, Annette""If you are not a Christian and have no intention of becoming one, does this mean God doesn<APO>t care about you? Is He not the Great Physician for ALL people? I really think most religious talk belongs on the spiritual/prayer board, if it is still available here. Take care, Annette""Hi, Geraldine Although I think religion is best left to other places, I have no problem with all inclusive prayers to help others, or something non-denominational, non-Christian, non-Muslim, etc. Like you suggest, a higher power, or creator works fine for me. Although that does leave out atheists, and agnostics, just something to think about... Take care, Annette""There is nothing wrong with a DO. They are doctors of osteopathy, they do medical school just like MD do, plus they learn about spinal adjustments. I have worked with DOs, and had them as my doctors. They are allowed to do surgery, specialize if they wish, and prescribe medicines just like an MD. One that I worked with was an orthopedic specialist, one was a family practioner, one a board certified ER doc, etc. I have worked with them in the ER, the ICU, and medical floors. I never heard of any nurse having a problem with their level of care for their patients. Some of them continue to do spinal manipulations after they graduate, some do not, you have to ask them when you make an appt. if that is what you are looking for. I had typhoid fever once and the internist (MD) couldn<APO>t figure it out, and the DO who worked in the ER did. I spent nine days in the hospital, that could have been reduced had the ER doc (DO) been caring for me all along. He came up to check on me the third day I was there (first shift he was back since I was admitted), he diagnosed me from an exam and the same lab work the MD had looked at. They are NOT dangerous. Take care, Annette""Yikes!!!! I am glad I went in with the idea that it would be a piece of cake. I feel so sorry that you went through so much after your procedure. Back when I had mine done, I was having 3-5 migraines a week, and spent a lot of time in the ER for migraines getting IV meds. If I had thought that the procedure would have made my migraines worse, I would have refused it, lol. Glad you are almost back to normal. Take care, Annette""FMS has lots of different treatments. You might look at the post about a person<APO>s doctor of 15 years getting ready to dump her. I posted suggestions there also. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I have FMS also, and an end to our pain is not anywhere in sight for us. At best we can try a number of different things and hope each one will decrease our pain levels a little bit. The cumulative effect should be enough pain control for us to function. I would just come out and ask your doctor, ""Are you planning to dump me?"" Explain that you feel desperate and would not know where to go if he did that. You may be misreading his intent. He may be feeling that he is not an expert in this area, but that doesn<APO>t mean he would just dump you. If he would, then better you know now and start to prepare for that. I would see a neuro if you have not already, and then try a rheumatologist that treats FMS, and perhaps a pain management doc that uses many different treatment modalities, not just injections and procedures. I also agree that a shrink or a therapist that uses cognitive behavioural therapy may be able to help you learn to cope better. Two books that I found very useful are ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns, MD and ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"" by Dr. Margaret A. Caudill, MD, PhD. They are reasonably priced and both have worksheets you can pull out and copy to use to track your progress. Take care, Annette""Most opiates are detectable in your urine by a simple urine screen for 3-4 days. Take care, Annette""You might ask the pcps you are considering, if they can refer you to a pain management doctor. Perhaps if they feel they are part of the fix they will consider it. You might also call or write to the state medical licensing board in your new state, and ask if there are any specific rules the state has in this regard. When I moved to Oregon, I did that, and found out the way to go about it. I see an internist now who manages all my meds. At one time I had to see a rheumatologist for my pain meds for FMS. Although, I agree with you that it is safer to have one doc prescribe ALL my meds and take care of all my health issues, it just isn<APO>t always done that way, depending on the geographical area you are living in. Some places make you go to a pain management doc, others let your pcp manage pain meds. It is not doctor shopping when you are looking for a new doctor when you first move somewhere, it is called being selective, lol. Hang in there, you will find someone. Take care, Annette""I forgot, if I found a doctor who looked good to me, I always told them that I would not expect them to write any pain med RXs for me until they felt comfortable and trusted me to do so. It has never taken any more than three visits, and they have offered to write for my pain meds. Trust goes both ways. Take care, Annette""Just follow your doctor<APO>s instructions from now on. If you don<APO>t want the injection, don<APO>t have it, just say ""no, thanks"". It is up to you, not them, if you are to have invasive procedures done. ALWAYS get a second opinion before having surgery of any kind. I would ask your doctor about the laying on your stomach for 48 hours that your PT suggested, I have never heard of that before. Usually bed rest is not suggested anymore for back pain.. I don<APO>t know if this was caused by a traumatic injury or if it is just a chronic condition for you like it is for most people. Discs problems are rarely caused by a traumatic injury, all though they are often discovered right after one, as that is often when the patient gets a scan done and finds them. They certainly can be made worse by falling or being hit by something. Back pain can take up to a couple of years to heal, but usually it is a matter of 2-3 months. Try and be patient, and ask your doctor after you get past this stage of your life for a list of exercises to strengthen your core muscles to help support your back to prevent future injuries. Take care, Annette""You did not mention any other treatments besides injections and surgery of one kind or another. I would go through all the other non-drug and oral drug therapies before I went under the knife or had injections. I had a cervical discectomy in 1992, and the next disc up herniated within six months, a common problem. I let it heal on its own. The difference between the two times for me was functional deficits that I had the first time, no functional deficits the second time. I would do surgery for a functional deficit but not just for pain, the odds are not that great when it comes to treating pain with surgery. I am 59 years old and have had migraines since I was 35, I would also not have injections in my neck or neck surgery for migraines. There are plenty of oral meds for migraines and it may seem like a lot of trial and error to find the right combo but it beats the risks of surgery, which usually does not work for migraines anyway. Have you seen a neurologist who does not do surgery for an evaluation? Also see a migraine specialist about that problem. Take care, Annette""Have you seen your pcp about this pain? Has he tested you for diabetes or other causes of neuropathy? How swollen does it get? If the foot doctor can<APO>t find anything wrong, maybe it is a systemic problem not a foot problem. Take care, Annette""Sounds like you got off to a good start. Let your doctor know how the neurontin works for you, it often requires frequent dose adjustments for the first few months. Take care, Annette""We can<APO>t really answer that question, only the doctor who is seeing her and examining her can. It could be diverticulitis, or it could be from scar tissue after surgery, it could be something else entirely???? She needs to keep seeing her doctor and follow his advice. If she feels he is out of his league, then she should see someone else. Take care, Annette""I am sorry for the loss of your dog, losing a companion animal is always hard. It sounds like your care for your back pain started out fine, then went down hill fast. I may be confused but my understanding is that after seeing your pcp you saw an orthopedic specialist and he gave you injections that did not help. When you declined anymore injections because they were not helping, he lowered your pain meds and told you to go to the ER or your pcp. This is probably because he is not trained to do pain management beyond some injections and surgical procedures. They usually don<APO>t manage chronic pain with meds. I don<APO>t know how far ahead you tried to change your last appt. with him, if it was less than 24 hours, they don<APO>t usually take kindly to that unles you have some sort of emergency. They may also have put you off because you told him you didn<APO>t want anymore injections and he can<APO>t do anything else, I don<APO>t know. It doesn<APO>t matter since he can<APO>t help you anymore anyway. I would go back to your pcp and discuss this all with him. Perhaps a neurologist or a pain management specialist can help if your pcp can<APO>t. No matter who you see, your back may never be the same, as Geraldine told you. Some back injuries heal and some do not, regardless of what kind of doctor you see. The good news is that even if it cannot be fixed, the pain can be managed so that your quality of life improves. You have to learn how the medical system works and push for good care. Take care, Annette""I have read that many disc problems take about 1-2 years to heal completely. I have been through surgery for one herniated disc, and waiting it out for the next herniated disc. I would avoid surgery unless you have a functional deficit as I did with the first one. I have had two EMGs, the first was very painful and the other didn<APO>t hurt at all. Same area of the body, a few months apart. I believe it was due to the person doing the test myself. Whether you have one done or not is up to you. If you are not going to have surgery, would the results of the test change the choice of treatment you opt for? If the answer is no, I would avoid the test for now. I now only have tests when the result would alter my treatment. Take care, Annette""Orthopedic doctors do not manage pain with meds, they don<APO>t have the training. They can do injections and surgery, but not much else. You need to see your pcp and if he can<APO>t help you with your pain, ask for a referral to a pain management doctor who uses oral meds and other modalities to treat pain if he can<APO>t manage it himself. I agree with you that the ER is not the place to go for chronic pain. Chronic pain does not always make ones B/P go up, you may be developing hypertension (high B/P). No matter what the cause of high blood pressure is, it needs to be treated to prevent heart attacks, strokes, and kidney failure. Especially since you are also a Type 1 diabetic. Orthopedic doctors do not treat B/P elevation, that is for your pcp to do. The orthopedic doctor may assume it is elevated because you are nervous about getting an injection, or he may assume that your pcp is taking care of it. Steroids can be used in diabetics for some conditions as long as the patient is carefully monitored. I would only take them with the approval of your diabetes doctor. Steroid injections do not dump a bunch of steroids into your system like pills do, so they do not affect the body the same way. Best of luck, Annette""By the way, I wasn<APO>t sure I recognized your name, but I checked and I did respond to your other post. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t think you would be having any kind of withdrawals if you changed your meds three months ago. Half of a 5/500 vicodin every other day should not even cause dependency. Insomnia, you said was part of being pregnant last time, so I would guess it may be the same thing this time. Feeling like you need to move your legs at night, anxiety, insomnia, and it feeling better if you take opiates sounds like restless leg syndrome to me. Discuss this with your pcp or your OB doctor. I feel like the vicodin is treating your symptoms if it is doing anything at all. I do not think it is causing them. Anxiety goes along with insomnia for me. I worry about how I am going to function if I don<APO>t sleep. I have restless leg syndrome and taking a pain pill does lessen the symptoms for me. Take care, Annette""Some states have data bases, some don<APO>t. So some places the pharmacist can look up your history of use of controlled substances, and in some places they can<APO>t. I would never get my RXs filled at different pharmacies. That makes it look like you might be trying to hide something. Besides it is safer for you to get all your RXs filled at one pharmacy to avoid any interactions. Most places run them through a computer and if there were to be any kind of interaction between your meds, the computer would tell the pharmacist that. Many doctors who treat chronic pain will ask their patients to use the same pharmacy all the time. Education is a good thing, if your pharmacist needs to learn, let him learn. If your pharmacist has a problem, he should speak to your doctor, or you should change ALL your RXs to a different place. Take care, Annette""I would just be honest with your pharmacist and tell him you saw your doctor and he mentioned that the pharmacist had called, and that the doctor shared his concerns with you. Ask him why he felt you had anger issues? Have a nice calm conversation with him to clear the air. If you find him over the edge, then you have to decide if you should change pharmacies. I don<APO>t know what RX you have had filled at the two pharmacies, but schedule II drugs require a paper RX rather than a phone call. Schedule III drugs can be called in. You should not require any early RXs, a pharmacist does that at his own peril, he could lose his license for doing that without a RX covering him. A local pharmacist here in Oregon was busted for that recently, unfortunately he did it far too often. A pharmacist is a licensed health care provider, they do not just fill RXs that a doctor orders. They are responsible for cross checking it with other RXs you might take, and checking for interactions, and also checking to make sure that you are taking the proper med at the proper dose for the medical condition you have. My friend<APO>s son is a pharmacist and has a PhD, he has a very long and expensive education, and a state license to protect. They do not just do what the doctor tells them to do, any more than a registered nurse does. I use my pharmacist as a valued member of my health care team. Take care, Annette""Even before the Prescription Monitoring Program, most states had laws on their books that if you got a RX med from one doctor and did not tell all other prescribing doctors about it, you were committing a felony. ALL the doctors had to know about each other and any RXs that you were getting. A parole officer I knew told me this was so the cops could hold you on something if they found multiple RX bottles in your home from different doctors. I was told this about 15-20 years ago. This was true in NV and Oregon back then. Take care, Annette""I agree with all your suggestions, except the last one regarding marijuana. It is a federal transgression to use or possess MJ, regardless of state laws saying it is okay. Just something to think about before using this. I tried it many years ago for pain, both smoking and eating it in baked goods, I got high, but it did NOT help my pain at all. After that I did not use it again. It does not work for everyone, like prescription meds. I would suggest trying Marinol to see if the THC helps. Most doctors I have known over the years would have no problem prescribing this drug. I trust my doctor and she and I work together to deal with my various problems. The cops can use this get-around method of busting people. It really doesn<APO>t concern me. Take care, Annette""My state just started the Rx Monitoring Program this year, it doesn<APO>t bother me either. I have always had a great give and take relationship with my pharmacist. My friend<APO>s son is a pharmacist, he has a PhD!!! He went to school forever and continues to do so for his license. He is not just a pill counter. Hugs, Annette""I do agree with you on everything you posted!!! I think all stores in the US anyway have the cash registers in the front of the store, the farther they get you to walk the more (mostly useless, lol) stuff they are likely to sell you. I am so proud of him, he did ironwork with his dad for summers growing up as a young adult, I know he wanted to retire early, lol. He drew blood at a hospital where I once worked. He did a lot before he got his PhD. I would definitely feel weird asking him to price check something. Take care, Annette""Sorry it took so long for me to respond. I would call your insurance company and ask them. I have not had that problem. I live up here in Oregon. Take care, Annette""Some people that have muscle pain on one anti-cholesterol drug may not have it with a different drug. What you should do if you still have the pain, and the cholesterol lowering effect of the med is very important for you depends on how severe the pain is. For mild muscle aches a hot bath might be all you need. Gentle stretching might help one person, but someone else may need more. help than that. I feel this is something your husband needs to discuss with his doctor. Speak up and tell him how much the muscle pain is disrupting your lives. Ask him straight out what to try to relieve it. I have strong feelings about taking one drug for the side effects of another, it would depend on how important the first drug was, and how long I would be expected to take it. Something to think about. Take care, Annette""I doubt that the Bell<APO>s Palsy has much to do with your current pain. Does the neurologist have any possible diagnoses that he is working towards? The thing with TN is that it does not always show up on an MRI or nerve conduction test, it is usually diagnosed by history. The painful episodes usually only last a few minutes, so if they typically last a lot longer the doctor may have ruled it out due to that. They also follow a distinct pathway along the nerve involved. I would take your tests and consult one more neurologist, and if he agrees, then I would just treat the symptoms you have and not waste a lot more time trying to figure it all out. That is just me though, some people really, really want to know just what the cause of everything is. I don<APO>t anymore. FMS can cause all kinds of odd pains and will make them hurt longer and for a really long time, is it possible this pain is just due to your FMS? Keep in touch, Annette""Have you been diagnosed with FMS for other pain in addition to this facial pain? Having FMS in addition to any other condition that causes pain would intensify that pain. Has the neurologist made a diagnosis of what is causing this facial pain? According to the Merck<APO>s Manual, Bell<APO>s Palsy is unilateral paralysis of the face, it comes on suddenly and the cause is unknown. I have seen hundreds of cases of Bell<APO>s Palsy, but never heard or seen of a bilateral case before. Did you have it on one side of your face at one time, then the other side another time, or did it affect both sides at the same time? Has the Bell<APO>s Palsy resolved completely? How long ago did you have it? In my experience with patients with Bell<APO>s Palsy they sometimes had pain behind their ear prior to the paralysis, but they did not complain of facial pain. In my understanding, Bell<APO>s Palsy affects the 7th cranial nerve, which affects movement of the face, tear glands and salivary glands, not a sensory nerve that would cause pain. Although it may affect taste in some cases. Have you had nerve conduction or EMG tests done since you had Bell<APO>s Palsy? The pain in the face that you describe sounds more like Trigeminal Neuralgia, a pain disorder, rather than a paralysis of the face. But your neurologist should know best. If he has done the appropriate testing, and you and your pcp are still not happy with how things are going, you might seek a second opinion from another neurologist in a different office. FMS is not easy to live with, but it can be done. I am doing it, lol. Chronic pain is something you just learn to adjust to and control the best you can. Then you get on with living the rest of your life. If acupuncture helps try and keep doing it if you can. Take care, Annette""So far, you have had all good news. The cardiologist ruled out heart problems, and the neurologist has done the appropriate tests and they also are negative so far for nerve problems. If the neurologist says he is at the end of his expertise and your nerves are all normal, then I might suggest seeing an orthopedic doctor and see what he says. Or go back to your pcp and ask him what he suggests. I have tried acupuncture and it did not work for me, but I do still believe it is useful for many people for many things. I don<APO>t believe there are significant risks as long as the provider uses single use needles. Give it a try and let me know what happens. But, continue to see your other doctors to get to the bottom of the whole thing. Don<APO>t forget to check your blood pressure also. Take care, Annette""I replied to your other post. Take care, Annette""Hi, BrenBren How about everyone who writes about a horrible experience balance that out if possible with a positive experience? I have only had one doctor in an ER treat me disrespectfully due to my pain issues, and one doctor (who was my pcp) with whom I could not come to an agreement about my FMS treatment. I found a new doctor, case closed. I have been blessed with far more positive experiences than negative ones with doctors, pharmacies, and family/friends. I have had NO trials with families due to my health issues at all. My husband, family, and friends have all been wonderfully understanding. Chronic illness does not mean one will not have happy relationships in their life. Please do not let this exchange turn into a ""poor me"" contest. Just my opinion. Take care, Annette""Hi, BrenBren I did not think you meant it to come out negative. That was just how I read it, and I just wanted others who might read it that way to try and think about positive things too. Hugs, Annette""You might also try using a cell phone reminder, or send yourself emails, etc. I would use a calendar like already stated, but my husband and son are both technically ahead of me. Isn<APO>t it great that the ER where you live treats you so well and are so welcoming! Take care, Annette""Hi, Gail You and I have known each other here for many years now. I am always inspired by you. You have altered your way of doing things time and again in response to your situation. You have up days and down days as we all do and are free with encouragement to everyone no matter how you are feeling. I am blessed with knowing you and would miss you if you left. Hugs, Annette""Yes, I believe it can be a permanent issue. You might seek a consultation with a top vascular surgeon in your area to see if any vein damage can be corrected surgically. It is a long shot, but can<APO>t hurt to ask. Take care, Annette""I would look for a therapist who sees a lot of patients with chronic pain. You might ask your pcp or pain management specialist if they know of anyone. Tell them what kinds of help you are looking for and they may know someone in your area who can provide that help. Take care, Annette""If you were there and heard your boyfriend tell the PA that although he has mild back pain, he really wants something to help as a sleep aid and help him unwind at night, and then the PA gave him oxycodone, then I would agree that the PA might be out of line. I would assume the RX was for a small quantity, so it probably isn<APO>t a problem. Oxycodone is an opiate pain med that is prescribed for moderate to severe pain, not mild pain, and it usually is not the first thing prescribed for ""mild"" back pain. If you were not present, and this is what your boyfriend told you, I would go with him next time and see what is actually said. Explain to your boyfriend and his doctor at this visit that you have had a negative experience through a friend with this drug and feel uncomfortable about the whole thing. He should not have a problem with you going with him to the doctor next time he sees him for back pain or gets a RX for opiates. The doctor can then explain to you why he feels it is necessary to prescribe this drug and the best way to use it. Addiction is a very small risk when someone uses opiates for chronic pain, recent studies show less than 5% of opiate users who follow their doctor<APO>s instructions become addicted to opiates. Only your boyfriend and his doctor/PA can explain if the RX was for pain or for something else. You may be over-reacting due to the previous problems with your friend<APO>s dad, I do not know. As another woman, I say follow your gut feelings. If your gut tells you something is just not right, it probably is not. It might be your boyfriend rather than the drug or the PA, be open to whatever it might be. Do your own research and move slowly. Take care, Annette""You need to sit opposite your doctor in an exam room and say what you have said here. Explain that you are doing everything he is asking of you and you are still having a lot of pain. Ask him how long he would think you might continue to require your pain meds. Explain that you don<APO>t want to be caught off guard at the last minute, and that you would also like to know if you should be doing other things that you haven<APO>t tried. I do NOT think that you should do this on the phone, make an appt. and see him in person for this conversation. You are only six weeks out from major surgery, I don<APO>t know all your previous history, but it doesn<APO>t sound like you are abusing them as long as you are following his instructions on how to take them. It sounds like you are saying you are slowly getting better. He may have other meds to suggest, or non-drug treatments to try in addition to what you are currently doing. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know what kind of meds you are on now or what your pain levels are. I take a long acting med on a set schedule, and breakthrough meds on an ""as needed"" basis. If I went a week without taking the ""as needed"" breakthrough meds, and if I were doing fine with tolerable pain levels, then I would discuss lowering my scheduled long acting meds with my doctor. Take care, Annette""Not all states seem to have guidelines for managing chronic pain, but I just called the state medical licensing board where I lived and asked them if they had them and if so to send me a copy. The doctor I spoke to was happy to oblige. He also answered a lot of my questions on the phone. Otherwise, you might do a search on Medscape and take the appropriate articles to your doctor to discuss. I only take articles from peer reviewed medical journals to my doctor. Meds are often a balancing act between effectiveness and side effects like sedation. Take care, Annette""Hi, Caprice How do I reset things so the ""Paging"" feature works? I still get sent to the beginning of a thread and have to click through to the latest post. Also when I click ""Reply"" the blank box that I type my response into runs into the right hand column of WebMD information, so that I can<APO>t see the right hand side of my post to proof read it before I click on ""Submit"". Thanks for any help. Take care, Annette""The text display box is working correctly as I type now. But I still go directly to the first page of a post that is pages long. It does that consistently, it never takes me directly to the last page of a long post. I wish.... Thanks, Annette""So, the paging won<APO>t help me, since I don<APO>t use the other sections of WebMD. Are the techies working on anything so I don<APO>t have to do all the scrolling up and down that is now needed to navigate? Are they at least going to put the number of pages at the top and the bottom of the initial page of a thread instead of just the bottom? They made the same error once before some years ago when they came out with new and improved software, and it didn<APO>t take them long to put the number of pages top AND bottom, once it was brought to their attention. Take care, Annette""Discuss this with your doctor. He may want to change your cholesterol medicine or adjust the doses of it or your pain meds. Take care, Annette""There is no way any of us here can tell you on line if it is normal or not. I suggest that any time you have new or different pain, you call your doctor and tell him. You may not have had an appt. with your OB doctor yet, if you don<APO>t have one yet, you might call your pcp. Take care, Annette""No short acting opiates are a good idea for headaches as they can cause rebound headaches. However, if you keep a careful log of your headaches, the time they start and end, and the times you take all of your meds, the doctor can figure out if you are ending up with rebound headaches. They are difficult to deal with when you have other kinds of chronic pain that require pain meds of this kind. Discuss any concerns you have with your doctor, he can evaluate you for risk/benefits of any of your drugs, and then you have to decide what to do next. I have been on opiates for well over 15 years, and they so improve my quality of life that I would not consider going off of them unless my body gave me a good reason to. So far, it hasn<APO>t. My doctor does blood work to check on organ function yearly with my regular checkup. Take care, Annette""I am glad to hear your pcp stepped up to the plate and took care of your meds. That is what pcps are for, to take care of you when you need them. I have no idea why your old PM doc left his practice suddenly. A surgeon my husband was seeing also left suddenly. I asked around and it turned out he was ill, and died a few months later. We found another surgeon of course. I hope your old doctor did not become suddenly ill. Just withdrawing from opiate pain meds does not cause seizures, but if you were on any benzos, that withdrawal can cause seizures. Some pain meds actually lower the seizure threshold so if your small brain aneurism might cause seizures, the doctor must have been aware of that already and prescribed your meds accordingly. Is it something that will require surgery to fix? Take care, Annette""The best place to carry a list of meds or history of medical conditions is stapled to your insurance card right behind your ID. That is where hospital people go to find out who you are and who is going to pay for your medical care. Usually, they stop once they find that info. I also give my doctor a dated copy of my medication allergies, current meds and how I am taking them, dose and times, at each appt. She loves it. Good for you for thinking of it too. Take care, Annette""I think wearing a medical alert braclet is a very smart thing for anyone with a chronic illness to do. You might also check with your local ambulance company to see what other things they use in your community to help communicate any special needs you have with the paramedics. I lived in one city that had people keep a list of their diagnoses, meds, and allergies in a certain place in their fridge in a special vial with a cork that had a certain label on it to make it highly visible. That only helps if they come to your home, it doesn<APO>t help if you are in an accident elsewhere. Take care, Annette""I switched from a generic MS Contin to methadone last year for financial reasons and it went very smoothly. I did not take them together, I question the wisdom of ever taking two long acting opiates at one time. I went over to the methadone at a very low dose, and used a generic Norco for BT pain as I slowly increased the methadone dose until my pain was controlled. I just suggest that you have a doctor that has a lot of experience with prescribing methadone, it is trickier than the other long acting opiates because it works completely differently. Best of luck to you, I<APO>m glad to hear you are doing better. Take care, Annette""I really don<APO>t recommend surgery for back pain unless you are having functional problems also, in addition to pain. The odds for it fixing pain if that is what you have, are very poor, about 50/50. For me that is not worth the risks involved with spinal surgery. It is up to you and your surgeon, please get more than one surgical opinion, from different doctors in different practices. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I should have said ""spinal"" rather than ""back"", I feel the same regardless with any disc surgery anywhere in the spine. Not doing things due to pain is different from not being able to do them at all. The example a doctor gave me once was the difference between being able to get up and leave a burning house in spite of the pain you were in, versus being paralysed and not being able to leave a burning house at all. The first time, I lost the small motor function in my dominant hand, I was dropping things as I had no grip to speak of anymore. My cervical spinal surgery fixed that. Six months later the disc above the surgical site herniated, and I developed numbness and some radiculopathy pain, but opted not to have surgery as I had no truly functional deficit. Artificial discs were not available back when I had my surgery. I would put off any disc replacement as long as you can so the doctors have time to fine tune this type of surgery. The better the replacement discs are, and the better the surgeons are at putting them in, the better off you are. We are different in that I would not opt to have a risky surgery for a 10% chance that it would fix pain that I can tolerate with meds and other techniques. I know what can go wrong with spinal surgeries. But that is why we all get to make up our own minds. Best of luck to you whatever you decide. Keep in touch. Take care, Annette""Personally, I would see a(nother) neurosurgeon, and get the second opinion before I had the discogram. They hurt a lot from what I have read and are mainly done as a pre-operative test to see just where the surgeon is going with the surgery. If you find a better-different surgeon, he may or may not even want one done. I never had one for my cervical disc surgery, the doctor said he could see what he needed to see from the MRI, he rarely if ever used discography, he didn<APO>t feel it made much difference in the long run. I don<APO>t know about that, since I have never had one done. I am sorry if I seem judgemental, but I would never see a doctor again who took a phone call during an appt. unless it were truely an emergency, and it must not have been since he came back and answered more questions. It has only happened once in my experience, a doctor who was consulting for W/C for my husband answered his cell phone and talked for a few minutes during our appt. From our end it was clearly not an emergency call. I agree with the other poster about orthopedic surgeons vs. neurosurgeons. I also prefer neurosurgeons when it comes to spinal surgery. There are lots of different pain medicines/cocktails to try. Many of the side effects go away with time, I would rather tolerate them for a few weeks, than have surgery. I would find a PM doctor who uses a lot of oral meds and work with him and make certain there are no others or combinations to try. Be sure to find a doctor that you like and feel you can work well with. I don<APO>t know what pain med you were taking when you had that episode, or if the episode was truely related to the med. This is something to work out with the prescribing doctor or your pharmacist. Just stopping the med abruptly might not be good for you either, so talk to the doctor about it. Take care, Annette""Best of luck to you. I hope all this works out well for you. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t think a sore throat from the breathing tube should be completelyg one yet so don<APO>t worry about that. The lump in your tongue could be many things. The first thing that comes to mind is that you could be having a swollen lymph gland, but I don<APO>t know how many of those happen in the tongue. Just let your doctor know and follow up on it. I would stop doing internet research on it and just go see the surgeon. I really believe in doing internet research once you have a diagnosis, but not to do your own diagnosing. Just my opinion. Take care, Annette PS, If you smoke, quit.""I assume by ""fetal"" you mean fetus and your friend is pregnant. I had my son 32 years ago and I was told to avoid caffeine and I did for the length of my pregnancy and throughout breastfeeding. I have not heard of melted cheese being a problem. I would suggest your friend speak to her OB doctor and ask what is okay and what isn<APO>t, and how much is a risk. Take care, Annette""I would suggest you pick one orthopedic doctor and continue on with him. I am not clear on the time line exactly, but it sounds like you had your LCL tear 6 years ago, and 6 months later had pain and an xray which was negative. That leaves a lot of time between then and now. The xray may not be relevant at this time if it was taken 4-5 years ago by a different doctor than you have now. He can<APO>t even look at it unless you bring it with you. I always take all my xray and scan films/CDs with me to a new doctor, otherwise they get repeated. It is customary for a doctor to start out with an xray and then move on to more expensive tests as needed. You may have to submit to an xray to get the MRI that you want. Take care, Annette""A lot can happen in 8-9 months. I would submit to an xray first, and then see what the doctor says, and get an MRI only if you actually need one. I would stick with one doctor too. Take care, Annette""What a wonderful, kind offer to make. I hope Gail gets in touch with you soon. I don<APO>t know if she uses oils or not. Best of luck in your future endeavors. Take care, Annette""I would see your neurologist and ask for PT for strengthening exercises so you can get up from a chair more safely, you might get a cane to make walking safer. You need to be measured and taught how to use it properly. Also ask to see an occupational therapist for suggestions on how to do things around the house safely. Things like sitting on a office chair with wheels in the kitchen. Opiates are usually not toxic to kidneys, and any nausea/vomiting they cause usually goes away after a few weeks. You could ask for an anti-emtic medication to use until then to help control the nausea. If you have degenerative disc disease and arthritis in your spine, it is likely it was there already, and you just discovered it because you had the scan after your injury. You probably would have had symptoms eventually anyway. The accident just made it all worse. You might also try standing with a phone book or small box to put one foot up on while you do kitchen work, you can alternate putting one foot up then the other. This is often helpful. Take care, Annette""Hi, Jacob You don<APO>t mention any pain below the waist, with FMS, you must have pain above and below the waist to meet the diagnostic criteria. I would mark that one off your list for now. If you develop pain below the waist, mention it to your doctors. It sounds like the costochondritis diagnosis was a reasonable one to make. I don<APO>t think 2 weeks of treatment without improvement is enough to challenge that diagnosis. I know motrin takes at least 3-4 weeks to reach its maximum anti-inflammatory effect. You may need some other type of pain management until it kicks in. What else did the doctor suggest, both drug and non-drug? You probably already know you need to quit smoking for your health also, but I will say it anyway, quit smoking!!! Maybe lose a little weight too, anything over 186 lbs. for a man 5<APO>10"" is considered obese by the medical chart in my textbook. These are much easier things to do at your age than when you get a lot older. What does your blood pressure run? Take care, Annette""You need to see a doctor in person. No one on line can diagnose your problem. The doctor would need to take a medical history and do a physical exam, and possibly some tests, but maybe not. Then he could make an educated diagnosis. Take care, Annette""There are pediatric pain management doctors. My nephew was treated by a pediatric pain management team while he was in the hospital and given opiates at age 8. They ARE allowed to give them if they have a medical reason to give them. There is no law that says children cannot get pain medicines. You can look for an adult pain management clinic, perhaps they will see you because you are close to age 18, but your parents would have to sign a consent for you and be willing to pay for you until you are 18 or whenever their insurance cuts you off. Then it will be up to you. With the new laws for health care, they should be able to keep you on their employer<APO>s insurance until you are older as long as they are willing to pay the premium. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Talk to your doctor before you get in trouble with pain, have a plan ready so you can avoid the ER as much as possible. I have not walked in your shoes. I do have chronic pain and migraine headaches, but have avoided the ER for many years, thanks to my doctor and careful planning ahead. I am sorry your dad<APO>s choice was suicide, it must be very difficult for his family. Take care, Annette""Wear panties and a t-shirt or camisole or shorts and a t-shirt. The hot tub is such a relief for me. I don<APO>t know if it would help you or not, but don<APO>t let a lack of a bathing suit stop you from finding out. I would really hate losing you, this exchange would really lose a lot if it lost you. I am especially appreciative of your responses regarding alcoholism/drug addiction in relation to pain management. By the way, my brother is in New Mexico and is clean and sober. He is waiting to establish residency so he can apply to a long term rehab place. The first one turned out to be very cultish. They told him he would not be able to call his family members for two years!!! Not a good thing to tell someone in our family, we are very close. He left after three weeks. It was ""just a chuck hole in the road of life"", as my mom used to say. He sounds stronger and much better. We talk at least once a week. Your posts have helped me a lot. Hugs, Annette""Swim or just sit in the hot tub. I adore my hot tub, it is the best investment we ever made. Alcohol is my brother<APO>s main adversary now. He quit hard drugs many years ago. He is using the AA meetings and therapy at this point. I am very proud of him. Flying out to visit is too hard right now, maybe in the winter time. Take care, Annette""Gail, I came into this conversation too late to know what the original topic was, but I too hope that you will stay/come back whenever you feel up to it. I would miss you a lot if you weren<APO>t every here. Hugs, Annette""I agree with Dave. I think one should see their doctor for any new or different kind of pain. Especially if is lasts for weeks. How much ibuprofen do you take and how long have you been taking it for? Most over the counter pain meds should not be taken for longer than three weeks without seeing your doctor and getting an okay from him to keep taking them. Take care, Annette""Worker<APO>s Comp is a whole other creature, they seem to just do what they want to do. They seem to think they are above everyone else. Hopefully, your doctor will work it out with them. If not, he can write you a RX and you will have to pay for it yourself. The oxycontin is pricey, there are cheaper long acting opioid pain meds available, you will need to discuss that with your doctor. I am surprised they didn<APO>t refuse to pay for the Lidoderm patches, they are really expensive!!! Take care, Annette""I am sure Swank will reply also. I define abuse/addiction as using a drug for other than its prescribed reason, in spite of the negative consequences in ones life. So, using a pain medicine to get high rather than for pain, or to alleviate emotional problems rather than for pain control would indicate abuse to me. Taking drugs to get high even though you have lost doctors because they found out you were misusing drugs, or getting a DWI, getting arrested for drug related problems, or fighting with your family all could be negative consequences. Taking an extra pill now and again for increased pain would be borderline to me, it might break your contract with your doctor, you might run out of pills early. But, I would call that pseudoaddiction. You can do a search on that term and read about it. Rather than get into that situation, I have worked out a plan with my doctor to cover flares of pain. I would call and make an appt. and go see her before I took extra pain pills. I am in pain all the time, being in a bit of extra pain for a day or two until I can get in to see her is something I can stand. Most doctors in my area keep an appt. or two each day open for urgent patients that need to be seen right away. The weekend would be the only time it would take more than a couple of days to see her, and we have a plan with other meds and pain control methods for me to use as necessary. In twelve years it has never been necessary to cheat and take extra pills. ""Be prepared"", is the old Boy Scout motto I think. it works for us too. Take care, Annette""I would find a neurologist you trust, and stick with him. Ask him about RSD, it is best diagnosed and treated as early and as aggressively as possible. It is usually treated with nerve blocks and PT along with whatever oral meds the doctor decides on. There are specific symptoms with RSD, changes in skin color and hair loss over the affected area. If you don<APO>t have RSD, you may want to see a doctor who knows how to do the exam for fibromyalgia. Take care, Annette""I would ask your surgeon for a referral to a pain management specialist or ask your pcp about a different RX. Take care, Annette""I would get 2-3 surgical opinions from different neurosurgeons in different practices. Then sit down with your husband (hopefully he went to your appts. with you) and talk about the various things that were said. I doubt you will ever have whatever it is you think a normal life is. Back injuries change lives forever. First you need to accept that, then go on with whatever kind of treatment/surgery you and your husband decide is right for you. It is ultimately your decision of course, but he will have to live with it too, so talk about it together. The benefit/risk ratio for back surgery is poor at best. A GOOD surgeon will tell you just what the chances are that you will have increased movement or decreased pain in your case. He will also be honest and tell you exactly what percentage of his patients with similar conditions actually do better after surgery, and what the risk of infections are in his patients. Ask him what he defines as success. Many studies define success as a 50% reduction in pain in 50% of the patients. That is not my idea of success. I would only have surgery for a functional improvement, not a decrease in pain. Write down your concerns and questions and write down the answers at your meeting, or have your husband do it for you. Do not schedule any surgery at the same appt. Go home and discuss things and think about things, perhaps have another appt. with the doctor you like the best if you have more questions. Then decide what to do. Remember that the hospital where you have the surgery is nearly as important as the surgeon you choose. Research their surgical infection rate and nurse/patient ratio. The fewer patients a nurse must care for, the lower the rate of surgical complications. Of course, you must also deal with your insurance company and which doctors and hospitals they cover. Surgery would be an absolute last choice for me. Take care, Annette""It is not a matter of how they compare to each other, it is a matter of how they work for you. Expect the Opana IR to be adjusted according to your pain levels. You may need Opana ER or some other extended release opiate that lasts longer than 4-6 hours. That depends on what your pain is from, how long you expect to have it, etc. Take care, Annette""You need to quit smoking in case you need further back surgery. Many surgeons won<APO>t touch someone who smokes. If you doctor has a problem with your smoking, why don<APO>t you offer to quit in return for a referral to a pain management doctor? Win, win for you. That said, just ask your pcp for a referral to a pain management doctor who uses a wide variety of pain management techniques including oral meds. If he says no, just find an Internist who manages the ILLNESSES you have. Few if any doctors will promise to give you opiates on the first visit. Take care, Annette""Welcome, I tried this once before but my screen froze up, Here we go again. It is always good to have a new person with different experiences and view points. I had a cervical discectomy many years ago for a functional deficit in my hands due to a herniation of the disc. I feel very lucky it was my neck and not my lower back as it seems the necks heal faster and work out better in the long run compared to lower backs. My main source of pain is fibromyalgia, for which I also take opioids, and a couple of other meds commonly used in pain management. I am a registered nurse, I had to stop working due to my illness years ago, but try to keep up as best I can. I am here as a community member not as an expert for WebMD. Hopefully, they will find a pain management expert soon, I know they are looking for one. This is a good group, I am glad you have joined in. Take care, Annette""It does sound like fentanyl suckers, they are like lollypops with opiate medicine in them. I would not want my kid driving around with him if he had one hanging out of his mouth. I think it sends the wrong message to younger kids. Where does he keep his meds while your kids are at his house for play dates, are they securely LOCKED up at all times? They should be. How does he dispose of the suckers after he uses them? There are skin patches of the same medicine that he can use as a long acting solution. If he needs to use the suckers very often, he may or may not be impaired while driving, there is no way for you to know for sure. For me, if I am in need of a breakthrough med, that means my pain is worse than usual. I would not be driving around when I feel that way. Call your local DMV, many states say no driving at all while you are using opiates, some states will let you as long as you are not impaired. With chronic use one is often not impaired. Do what your gut tells you, the mommy feeling is usually correct. It is fine for you to just be honest with him and tell him you would rather drive the kids yourself when his pain is severe enough for him to use the suckers. You would come across to me as being proactive and helpful. Take care, Annette""Glad to hear you are home and got your pain meds adjusted. I always write down my concerns/questions and take them with me to the doctor. I write down his responses in my own shorthand so I can remember what he said later. It is easy to forget what he said because of anxiety or nerves during the visit. Take care, Annette""I would also recommend you see a rheumatologist for an accurate diagnosis. It may well be you do have FMS, but if you are concerned enough to worry about it, get the tests done that are available for MS so you don<APO>t need to worry. A spinal tap and an MRI are the most definitive tests for MS that I am aware of. Even then it is possible to have it in its very early stages and not show up. Myself, I have FMS, and DDD of my cervicle spine, I don<APO>t look for more things to worry about. Neurological symptoms are not that unusual in FMS, parasthesias like burning, numbness and tingling are things that I find common. You might go to the FMS Exchange, they have Dr. Pellegrino there, he is great, knows all about FMS, he actually has it himself, post there and ask for him by name in the heading. Take care, Annette""What is OPC-3? What is it for? I am glad it is working for you and your mom, please let me know how things work out for you. Take care, Annette""I am glad this is working for you and your mom. There is a fine line here between telling others about how well a product works and selling it, so I wouldn<APO>t offer people your sister<APO>s or uncle<APO>s numbers. Stick to telling us about the product and how it works for you. How long have you been on it? My problem with dietary supplements is that there was a study about ten years ago that my rheumatologist told me about, and I went and read for myself, it said that they analyzed a number of products from both large and small companies and found that they contained anywhere from 0 to 300% of the ingredient stated on the bottle, plus they often had other contaminants including prescription meds and heavy metals. My rheumatologist had part of his training in Germany where they use a lot of herbal supplements, and he was all for using them properly. He told me that in Germany and most parts of Europe herbals are treated just like other prescription drugs are in the US, they are tested for purity, safety, and efficacy. In the US they are not, they have no oversight at all, they are considered a food product. As he put it, you know what you are getting just like you know what you are getting from a drug dealer on the corner, you don<APO>t! After that study, he recommended all his patients stop using supplements until the US started proper testing and analysis of them. They still have not done that. I no longer use them. There is a lab on line somewhere that does analyse supplements, but you have to pay to join and get all their information. Take care, Annette""I hope no one was hurt. I don<APO>t know if you were impaired at the time you did this, I suspect you are not telling us the entire story. How recent was your last surgery, did you have the doctor<APO>s okay to drive, etc. If you were not impaired, then you are responsible and need to pay up to fix the car you hit. If you were impaired, you shouldn<APO>t have been driving, and still need to pay up to fix the car you dmaaged. Whatever happened, you hit a parked car, so you are responsible to fix things and make them right. I use the word impaired because that is how it is where I live. One can use prescribed drugs, and as long as one is not impaired, one can still drive. If your drugs cause impairment, you may not drive. It is up to the officer at the scene to decide what happened as much as he can. Other states have different laws. I believe in following the law where you live and if you disagree with it, work to get it changed. Don<APO>t just do what is right for you, do what is right for all the other people on the road. Take care, Annette""Has your neurologist done any tests like MRIs to look inside your back to see what is going on? If they are all negative, I would write down my concerns, and go see him and hand him the paper. It is fine for you to refuse any treatment you have already tried, I would do that, and just not get up out of the chair until the doctor had a plan for me. I used to have a list of all the meds and other things I had tried for my migraines, and pain conditions, I would hand it to them at the first visit, and tell them I was not going to do these treatments over again as they did not work. When you tell them about your pain, be sure to tell them things you are unable to do due to the pain that you would like to be able to do. This helps give them an idea of what kinds of goals you have. There is not always a cure for our pain, but it should be made managable with treatments, including meds. Take care, Annette""Some years ago, I read several articles about Chiari malformation surgery and its affects on widespread pain. I have FMS, and the pain seems to be somewhat similar in distribution. I read that you needed a special MRI to diagnose this properly, it is not the same kind of MRI that they do of your neck to check for problems with discs for instance. I have DDD of the cervical spine so I have had lots of those. It is a slightly different view. Have you already had that? Perhaps you could arrange to send the films or digital disc to a specialist in NY at the Chiari clinic there. They could look at them and tell you if you require additional care. Or perhaps you could have a neuro-radiologist there in Vancouver take a look at your films? They are great specialists, my husband took his MRI/CT scans to one here in Portland, OR when he had a subdural hematoma. They are specially trained radiologists that only look at films of the nervous system. Take care, Annette""It depends on what the MRI is off as far as the price goes, but I think they mostly run about $1,000 here too. It is my understanding that to have a diagnosis of Chiari malformation you must have the special MRI, not just for the tethered cord syndrome. Have you had that special MRI already? Or just the regular cervical MRI? I did go to the site you offered and watched the video of the doctor explaining occult tethered cord syndrome. He said right at the beginning that it is hypothetical, so I wouldn<APO>t put all your eggs in that basket until more research is done. I would keep reading and researching and save the articles and other research that you find to discuss with your neurologist/neurosurgeon. I would not jump into surgery of any kind until you know exactly what you do have and have adequate proof that the surgery will help your condition. Lots of folks with FMS jumped at having Chiari surgery with the initial research about that kind of surgery and FMS, and it turned out that although they had the same symptoms, the surgery did not help them. They had FMS, which is not curable with any surgery. For awhile the doctors were saying that the Chiari surgery would cure FMS, they found out that it doesn<APO>t. This is one of the reasons why it is important to wait until ALL the research is done, not just preliminary research. Take care, Annette""So, the MRI that you have had at this point is the regular cervical MRI? I would just keep doing your research and discussing it with a doctor that you feel comfortable with. The problem is that a lot of symptoms match up with a wide variety to diagnoses, the physical exam that the doctor does is very important in making a final diagnosis All you can do is the best you can. Don<APO>t worry about being your authentic self when people say ""How are you doing?"", they usually don<APO>t really want to know all the details, it is just an automatic thing that people say. I tell everyone I am doing fine, and tell my close friends exactly how I am doing, but only when I feel it is appropriate. Usually, I only mention the positive stuff because that makes me feel better too. Repeating negative stuff over and over, just makes me feel bad too. Vent whenever you want to here. That is what we are all here for. I am having more pain than usual, but it is probably because I am being more active than usual, so that is a good thing, lol. Thanks for asking. Take care, Annette""It has fentanyl in it, a strong opiate. It is never given to opiate naive patients, you need to be on daily oral opiates first, then if they don<APO>t work, this is one option to try. It is a pain med, not an anti-inflammatory. It is absorbed through the skin and the patch is changed every 48-72 hours. You can use other opiate meds by pill for breakthrough pain. It is something to discuss thoroughly with your doctor and pharmacist before you consider going on it. Take care, Annette""I am sorry, I didn<APO>t go back and read the post before. I believe that the Flector patch is an NSAID patch, check with your pharmacist, I am not positive. I don<APO>t believe a doctor would put you on Flector instead of the fentanyl patch at 100 mcg./hr. I think he might add it to your regimen? I thought you were talking about the fentanyl patch, oops. Take care, Annette""Hi, Gail What kind of surgery are you having on Friday, if you don<APO>t mind me asking? If you do mind, just don<APO>t answer, lol. I will keep you in my thoughts, and think only positive things for you. Hugs, Annette""I have not had anything like the surgery you are going to have. I will keep you in my thoughts Friday and hope all goes well for you. Take care, Annette""Gail, I would never tell you what to do as far as amputation goes. I know it is a mixed bag for results with folks with RSD, but I know you have gone through so much pain with yours, you should try whatever you can. It is absolutely a decision to be made by you and your doctors. I wish you all the best. I hope it works for you and gives you the results you are hoping for. I don<APO>t have RSD, and never have, I just passed on what information I had read. Someone else posted here not too long ago that they had had an amputaion for RSD with excellent results. I saw that my post to you had been deleted along with the posts that had preceded it in that thread. When they delete one post, they also delete all the posts connected to it. I was glad to see them gone. But I wasn<APO>t sure if you had seen mine, and I did miss your reply. I will keep good thoughts for you on Friday. Hugs, Annette""Sorry, I don<APO>t really know the drugs best suited for RA. I think he should just trust the doctor who is writing the RX, give each med an honest try and see how it works, if it does not work, he must tell the doctor and try another one. Many illnesses that cause pain cause folks to try different treatments until one finds the ones that work for them. Take care, Annette""I agree with your husband<APO>s pcp, it sounds like things are pretty complicated at this point and a rheumatologist might be appropriate. The pcp was probably being honest when he suggested there was nothing more he could do. I believe your husband is on the most frequently used RA drugs. You don<APO>t have to go to the same rheumatologist, or if you do, you could ask her to please explain things better as you are having trouble understanding her. Sometimes doctors forget and speak medicalese when they should speak plain English. Some doctors from other countries don<APO>t realize that sometimes their foreign accent gets in the way of good medical treatment. Whatever the problem, just be honest when you don<APO>t understand something, don<APO>t leave without getting a clear understanding of what is going on. Take care, Annette""Hi, Dr. Maine Welcome to the board, I read your bio and it sounds like you have a lot to offer us all. Thanks for your participation. Take care, Annette""Hi, Gail Just know that I will be thinking of you today. I hope all goes as planned. Hugs, Annette""If you need to speak to the doctor about worsening pain, make an appt. to see him. Do not play phone tag with him. If it is important to you, he will expect you to go see him. He can<APO>t examine the area over the phone. If it is swollen, hot, and red, you may have an infection, tell the nurse that and she should schedule you for a prompt visit, or tell you to go to the ER if he is really not available. The latest research says that an MRI is not needed for most injuries from MVAs. It is normal for a doctor to xray the neck to make certain you don<APO>t have a severe injury there, that is the most vulnerable part of your spine. I am personally glad for any doctor that is willing to treat our veterans while they wait to be seen by the VA, they deserve that. Take care, Annette""It sounds like you won your doctor over to your way of thinking. I think it is great that you can see another kind of pain management specialist. I personally do not like the ""injections only"" kind of doctors. You might ask about trying antiseizure meds, they help with my chronic pain. I don<APO>t bother with more MRIs, I know my neck is a mess, I don<APO>t need to know it is worse. I would have one if I were losing function of my hands again, to see if surgery would be an option, it is not an option for pain alone. The MRI does not tell you why your discs might be worse, just if there is a change since your last MRI. I believe if you get a small amount of benefit from each of several pain management techniques the total amount of relief may be substantial. Keep checking out the different techniques available. Take care, Annette""One usually has a one year followup with a surgeon to see how one is doing. Perhaps you could see him a bit early and bring this up with him. I think one should always tell ones surgeon if they have new or different symptoms, the surgeon should be able to tell you if it is common after the type of surgery you had. I had a cervical discectomy in 1992, but did not have any metal or bone added in, just had the disc removed. So my case is somewhat different than yours. I had trouble swallowing for a while, but it went away on its own. Take care, Annette""If oxycodone cuts your pain in half, then maybe in addition to thinking about pain meds, the thing to look for are other treatments that also help cut down your pain levels. It sounds like maybe you are having neurological issues in your left lower extremity, are you taking any meds specifically for neuropathic problems? Are you using any non-drug pain management techniques? I find that if I find a few different treatments, and each of them help reduce my pain a bit, then the total amount of relief is worthwhile. My pcp writes all my RXs, I prefer that as I feel it is safer than getting drugs from several different doctors. But, I understand the W/C insurance requires their own doctors in some states. Take care, Annette""Hi, Oscar You are a lucky man to have found your wife, she sounds like a gem. I take pain meds, and only use generics, there are plenty available. I also take neurontin in its generic form, gabapentin. It is good for nerve pain. I take generics because I believe that they work, have a proven track record as far as side effects go, and are much cheaper than brand name drugs. I took all kinds of meds for migraines that caused a dry mouth, I sucked on hard candies like lemon drops, that helped a lot. I don<APO>t know where you live or what kind of W/C you have to deal with, at some point it may be best for you to just pay for your own meds if they won<APO>t, but I would still keep fighting with them and document everything for future problems. Take care, Annette""If your area has a 211 line, call then and ask for help. I know there are groups for people who are survivors of violent crime. 211 is like 411 or 911, except it provides info about help for these kinds of problems and others. It can take about a year for healing nerves to stop hurting, that is about how long it took me after surgery. Just look forward to the future and better days. Take care, Annette""I forgot until just now, most states have crime victim assistance programs available. My son was assaulted when he was a child, and they paid for a lot of the counseling he needed. I had to do a lot of paperwork, but they kept sending me checks for several years. Call the DA<APO>s office in the state where the stabbing took place and ask them how to locate their program. That was how I found ours. Take care, Annette""If your current doctors are managing your pain now, I would not bother to see a PM specialist at this time. When and if the time comes that your pcp and your rheumatologist are unable to help you any more, then I would see a PM specialist. Take care, Annette""I would give a new doctor three visits, then if we hadn<APO>t clicked, I would start interviewing new ones. Fortunately, by the third visit I have had good results for the most part, only once have I had to find a new doctor after that. Before you switch, I would tell the doctor what your concerns are and see if things get better. It is hard when you first start out with someone. It can be difficult to speak up, but I have found it often breeds trust, and after that things improve. Take care, Annette""That is how you do it here as far as I know. You post it for everyone to see, and the doctor reads the posts too and responds when he can. There are no private communications with the doctor that I am aware of. If there are Caprice will let you know. She stays on top of things here. Take care, Annette""I agree, I think the surgeon should have discussed the extent of the amputation with you long before you hit the hospital just before the surgery!!! That said, I think it is good that he was discussing it with your other doctor since it is not a frequently done procedure for RSD. I also happen to agree with them about taking off a bit more than just the toe. You mentioned in a post a few days or a week ago that the RSD pain had spread farther than just your toe, to me it makes sense to amputate above the level of the RSD pain, otherwise it will still hurt. Your scar should be about the same length, it might actually be more esthetically pleasing, a smoother transition. The anesthesiologist made a common decision for an orthopedic surgery of a lower limb. Spinal anesthesia is common with sedation, rather than a general anesthetic which has its own risks. My husband had a hip replacement surgery nearly two years ago, and he had a spinal with sedation rather than a general anesthetic. I think the difference between a spinal and an epidural is how deep the needle goes. With an epidural the needle goes into the epidural space, with a spinal I think the needle a bit goes deeper. Transcriber should be able to tell us, she is a neuro specialist, I am not. I had a spinal when they turned my son over when he got stuck during birth, it not only numbed me up, I could not move my legs at all for several hours. Sometimes you have to let go and let the doctors use the education and experience that they have to make medical decisions. They talked to my husband like he had a choice between a general and a spinal with his hip replacement, but I could tell the anesthesiologist had already made up his mind to do the spinal. It turned out fine. Refusing to just go along with them takes a bit of strength that we don<APO>t always have at that point in time, I think that is why they wait until then to try and just steamroll us through what they want to do. I went in to have my tubes tied with a scope at a small rural hospital where I worked, and the GYN doctor had never discussed with me what would happen if he got the scope in and found anything abnormal. The standard consent said I agreed to anything he wanted to do. I crossed that part of the consent out and initialed it and told the OR nurse that I would own the hospital and the doctor<APO>s home if he did anything without waking me up and discussing it with me first, unless my life depended on it. He found some ovarian cysts, and was going to just open me up and remove them, the OR nurse, reminded him that I had refused that part of the consent. So he closed up the scope holes and woke me up and we discussed it. I at least needed to make arrangements for my small son if I were going to be anything other than a day surgery. I survived, and so did you. Anyhow that part of it is over, now you just need to get through recovery, and see how it all works out for treating your RSD pain, hopefully that will be a thing of the past. I will keep my fingers crossed and light a candle for you. Hugs, Annette""I am so glad to hear you have your brother waiting on you during your immediate recovery. I am sure everything will go well, you have the right attitude and that is half the battle. You are right, hospitals are their own little worlds. People who work there or used to work there tend to take them for granted, we are used to navigating them and just do it automatically. I always recommend that anyone who must be in the hospital try and have a friend or family member to just sit with them, and pay attention to what is going on, an advocate if you will. It also helps to just have someone to hold your hand, lol. Hugs, Annette""How did your surgery go today? I hope everything is okay, I am thinking of you. Hugs, Annette""Have you tried any other non-opiate medicines or non-drug treatments for your pelvic pain? Perhaps an antidepressant or an antiseizure med that is used for neuropathic pain? Sometimes it takes a combination of meds to do the trick. Have you tried other opiates to see if something else does not cause the nausea? How long have you been on a steady dose? Usually the nausea does go away after a few weeks or months, but not always. I would give up on the surgery for now, if there is no one in North America interested in doing it for you, it may be the wrong treatment for you. Take care, Annette""It is an interesting article, Charles. Thank you for posting the link to it. I have found a variety of articles at that site to be useful and interesting. Take care, Annette""Another serious problem with the elderly is any medicine that increases their risk of falling. A broken hip in women especially, can mean an end to independent living. Strokes and decreased mental status are common in elderly women after a hip fracture from a fall. Elderly people also metabolize meds differently and have different co-morbid illnesses that complicate treating pain. I am only 59 and I have always had a fear of falling down and breaking my hip. I have seen it too often in elderly women. Take care, Annette""I am so sorry that you and your wife have been through this difficult time. How scary. I do not know what the conversion is for intrathecal meds, but usually when you switch to a new med taken orally you start at about half the equianalgesic dose, then adjust upward as necessary. I have never heard of meperidine being used in an implanted pump before. It is out of favor used in other ways because of the toxic side effects of its metabolites as it breaks down in the body. Personally, I wouldn<APO>t use it, but that is just me. If she and her doctor feel that it was worthwhile for her and it worked, then I don<APO>t blame her for wanting to go back. However, if she thought the headaches were caused by the meperidine, then perhaps it is not that good an idea. Whatever she decides, I hope she gets back on her feet quickly, and back to normal soon. Take care, Annette""I would suggest you see a doctor here in the States before you leave and find out what this is. At least rule out heart problems. Even with traveler<APO>s insurance, you do not want to have to try and navigate a foreign hospital system while figuring this out, on top of your job responsibilities. Take care, Annette""I am SO jealous, are you actually going to the World Cup? My Dad took me to see Pele play twice in San Francisco in exhibition games. I am totally dating myself, but it was one of the high points of my life. We were soccer fans before soccer was played in the schools in the US, dad played for many years in San Francisco in an adult league. I played better than most guys, but of course ""girls"" weren<APO>t allowed to play in leagues in those days. We weren<APO>t in Little League baseball either, lol. Have a great time, hope your pain goes away at least for your trip. Take care, Annette""You need to be examined by a doctor. The ER is one choice, an urgent care center is another, you can also go back to the doctor that inserted the IUD, and ask about payment plans or a discount since you no longer have insurance. Some doctors will do that for an old patient. Some communities have various free clinics, but you have to search for them on line, or ask Goodwill, Salvation Army, or Catholic Charities where to find them. I do not recommend trying to self diagnose by looking up your symptoms on the internet, a skilled examiner must do a physical and take a medical history also. Take care, Annette""I would just tell the doctor, you say he seems like a good guy. Just state the facts, don<APO>t try and blame anyone or make any guess as to why your message didn<APO>t get through. Use the morphine RX as an example, and ask him how he would like you to handle these kinds of things between appts. It might be the nurse, it might be the system they use isn<APO>t working, or it may be the doctor himself messed up for whatever reason. This will let him know that whatever it is has affected patient care. No good doctor wants that to happen. This gives him the opportunity to communicate with you exactly what he wants, and the opportunity for him to fix the internal problem in his office. I always call to remind my doctor about a RX that I need to pick up about a week ahead of time, then I either get a call from her office, or I call them before I make the trip over there to pick it up to make sure it is ready and waiting for me. I do my part and she does hers, so far it has worked for us. Each doctor has his own way of doing things, so you have to speak up. Take care, Annette""I have FMS, and I developed a burning pain on the backs of my knees and down my calves. I went through a bunch of tests and it came down to it just being a part of FMS. I used Lidoderm patches and started neurontin around that time. The two together helped and after about a year, the pain left as mysteriously as it had started. I saw my internist, a neurologist and an orthopedic surgeon. No one really could find anything else wrong to blame it on. I had had a lower back MRI shortly before that, and it was clean as a whistle. Sciatica is an inflammation of the sciatic nerve and will usually respond to oral steroids pretty quickly. I did a short course of those and they did nothing. Pain management doctors aren<APO>t really there to diagnose what is wrong with you, just to treat the pain, either with interventions, meds, PT, OT, etc. Since then over the last ten years or so, it occasionally (2-4 times) flares up for no reason that we can tell, and I use the Lidoderm patches, or a TENS unit that I have. It has never lasted more than a few days since the original time. ""Bedridden"" is bad for you, FMS gets much worse with laying around all the time. Unless you have other symptoms besides the pain that you haven<APO>t mentioned, take the pain pills the doctor gives you and get up and moving. I know I don<APO>t feel like it when I am in pain, but it is the best thing for you. It will not make the pain go away, but you will feel much better in the long run. Laying around will net you a blood clot, not good. You might check out the good, medical info on FMS at http://www.myalgia.com Take care, Annette""Sorry, I am not sure what the reason for your original post was, apparently you just wanted to vent since you rejected both my and transcriber52<APO>s suggestions. I thought you wanted suggestions. I have been dealing with chronic pain for well over 15 years and just wanted to help. Again, my apology. Take care, Annette""You have multiple pain conditions, I think it may be unreasonable to expect to be pain free any time soon. You should shoot for decreasing your pain until you can manage to function better. It has only been four months since your fall. With FMS, any painful injury is likely to hurt more and longer than it would for someone without FMS. Low back injuries often take a year or two to heal. I would continue to do whatever the doctor says, let him know just how you feel, and what kinds of things you would like to be able to do that you can<APO>t now due to the pain. Let him know that you have some goals you would like to attain. Write down the things you need to tell the doctor before each appt. and take the list with you. Write down the suggestions the doctor makes. It is hard to keep adjusting the meds, and trying new ones, but that is what we need to do to find the best treatment plan. It is worth it in the end. Now that you have had all the tests done, I would stick with one doctor as much as possible. You might go to your state dept. of disability and vocational rehabilitation. They may be able to retrain or educate you to do some other kind of work. I found the doctors appreciated my efforts in that direction back when I was still able to work. When I finally applied for SSDI, the judge who granted my claim also appreciated it. Take care, Annette""You have to take responsibility for your behaviour. It isn<APO>t your husband<APO>s fault, you blew it. You might look for a pain management clinic that has an addictions specialist associated with them. Go to NA meetings, do whatever you need to do to show the doctors that you are taking this seriously and working towards sobriety. You may have to accept that until you earn a doctor<APO>s trust back you may not get any opiates and will have to use alternative methods of dealing with your pain. We can<APO>t fix this for you, but I will support all your efforts to make things right again. Take care, Annette""When you urinate in a cup and hand it to them, I think you are pretty much giving your consent for testing. They don<APO>t need any kind of a waiver to get a urine screen where I live. I know when my doctor started doing urine drug screens, there was no question as to what they were testing for, they told me. The alternative was to find another doctor. Most doctors that prescribe opiates and ask for random urine tests are clear that you are free to seek out another doctor if you don<APO>t want to take a test. Many PM doctors have their patients sign a contract that says they will give urine when asked for drug screens, among other things before they get long term opiates. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I have never even heard of it. I will research it and see what I can find. Take care, Annette""I Googled it and it seems to be a minimally invasive surgery to remove disc material and decompress the spine. I think similar surgery is available in many places. they may use a different brand of endoscope. It seems the Accurascope is a brand name of the equipment used. I would not bother with this, surgery is surgery, and has a poor record of actually relieving spinal pain. I saw lots of testimonials but not research material that showed it actually worked, nor did I find lists of complication rates, infection rates, etc. To be honest, I did not spend a lot of time researching this, I just visited a few sites. Do your research and ask for actual medical research not testimonials. Take care, Annette""That is a lot of injections, epidurals, and nerve cauterizations to have on one year, do they really help? If not, I would quit that and look for something else. When you have degenerative disc disease you do tend to lose height in the discs and thus your total height can drop. I only have DDD in my cervical spine and I have lost about an inch and a half. Perhaps it is time to try oral meds rather than the injections, you didn<APO>t mention those. Maybe once your pain is better controlled, you will be able to exercise a bit more. Take care, Annette""What about a lower dose of opiates, so you are not loopy, but have some decrease in pain levels. You didn<APO>t mention morphine, levorphanol, or methadone. Many side effects like the nausea and loopiness go away after you stay on the med for awhile. Nothing will make the pain go away completely. The trick is to find different things that each help a little bit. I also use Lidoderm patches over bad places with my FMS, it works really well, when I need them. They are pricey though if you don<APO>t have insurance to cover them, you can try the company that makes them, see if they have a patient assistance program. Lyrical did nothing for me, but neurontin works really well for pain as well as many of the FMS symptoms. I adore my hot tub. Cognitive behavioural therapy is great too. You just have to keep trying different treatments, and don<APO>t forget exercise (start slowly and go up even slower), and you will at least learn to manage chronic pain. Take care, Annette""If the S-I joint injection worked for you, then fight for it. I just wouldn<APO>t bother with injections that don<APO>t really help. I find that getting a small amount of relief from each of several sources adds up to significant relief. It makes them all worthwhile. I remember you too. I hate the new format myself. Scrolling up and down and up and down, just takes too long. I can<APO>t wait until the old email digests come back again. I am hoping to hang on until then. It is good to see you again, please stay. Take care, Annette""I was also very active, had horses, etc. before FMS.It has been about 15 years now, and I am really just getting going again. I really slowed down physically, but finally I am getting more active again. I volunteer one morning a week walking dogs for an hour at the animal shelter. I have made some good friends there. I am doing belly dance classes I recorded off the TV fitness channel, two classes for a total of about 30-45 minutes a day. I found I will be exhausted no matter what, and I do feel better doing them. NO ONE gets to watch, lol. They are fun, and that is what matters to me. I cannot just ""exercise"", too boring. This actually distracts me from my pain and I have found they do not cause that much more pain than I already have. Last night I thought I would fall asleep while doing them, but I didn<APO>t, lol. I do limit myself to the two classes, I have found that doing three makes my pain significantly worse than the two that I usually do. Everyone is different, and has different abilities at different times in their lives. You do what you can do and don<APO>t worry about it. I am so sorry for your aunt<APO>s loss. I lost a cousin and his sister<APO>s husband this last January. It is tough no matter how old someone is. I hope you were able to enjoy your family reunion. Take care, Annette""You have a diagnosis, now ask for a treatment plan that makes you feel better and function better. Bursitis, tennis elbow, and carpal tunnel sound like enough to cause pain to me. If you feel it is important to have an MRI, ask the doctor about it and figure out if having one would change your treatment plan. Take care, Annette""I<APO>ve never heard of this diagnosis either. The diaphragm is the internal muscle between your chest cavity and your abdominal cavity. It keeps all the organs in their proper cavities, and it also aids a lot in your breathing. Your chest muscles go in and out with each breath and your diaphragm goes up and down with each breath, both tend to adjust the size of the chest cavity when you inhale/exhale. Spasms of the diaphragm cause hiccoughs. How was yours damaged, and what kind of symptoms do you have? Take care, Annette""Tell your doctor that if he cannot help you manage your pain, you would like a referral to someone who might be of assistance. Don<APO>t give up though. Take care, Annette""You may have also developed FMS, you might ask your doctor to rule out the other possibilities and do a tender point exam to see if that is likely. If he doesn<APO>t know how to do a tender point exam for FMS, then I would see a rheumatologist who treats a lot of FMS patients. FMS can cause fatigue and random widespread pain. Read about it at http://www.myalgia.com . Take care, Annette""My reference book says that myofascial pin syndrome is usually in a particular area, not all over the body like fibromyalgia is. Pseudo sciatica pain just means it feels like it is sciatic pain, but the pain doesn<APO>t come from the sciatic nerve. It means the cause is unknown. Stretching often helps sciatic pain, so maybe it will help this in the long run. Try taking a hot bath or shower before and after you do the exercises. It will warm up the muscles by increasing the blood flow to the area, that is good to do before you begin. Then afterwards, it will relax the muscles, that should help with pain. FMS depends on the tender point examination to diagnose, this is completely different from trigger points. A tender point hurts right where the doctor pushes with his finger. A trigger point causes pain distal to the spot where the doctor pushes. For instance if he pushes at a spot on your shoulder, it might hurt lower down on the arm, rather than right on the shoulder, or if he pushed on a spot on your hip, it might hurt farther down on your thigh. What kind of muscle relaxant did he give you? The benzos are pretty well known for giving one nightmares. Let him know and see if he can try a different one. I went through several before I found the best one for me. Take care, Annette""Stretching and exercise is important to continue as an on-going part of your life, not just for a week here and there. I take a hot shower or soak in my hot tub before stretching or exercising to warm up my muscles. Some exercises I can do in my hot tub, that is the best. Try to find many different things that each help your pain a little bit, then when you add up all the benefits you will find they may be substantial. Take care, Annette""The doctor is correct in saying that nothing will get rid of all your pain, and you are right in wanting better pain control. I have been through that part you mentioned about dreaming you were in horrible pain only to wake up and realize the pain was still there. It is terrifying. I was not working when I got that bad, but it did make me decide to try long acting pain meds, just during the night at first.. Does your nursing school allow students to use opiates while on the job at the hospital providing patient care? Some states allow nurses to use pain management drugs and others do not. I used short acting meds in the evening after work while I was still working because the state I lived in then did not allow nurses to use opiates on the job. Find out by calling your state nursing board, I have used mine for questions for years and they have always been wonderful. Your doctor may be assuming that if you are a nursing student, you cannot take long acting opiates, and he might be wrong. I am not defending him, because I suspect he isn<APO>t thinking that way, it is just a thought. I had one doctor that asked my nursing director right in front of me after emergency midline abdominal surgery how long she could spare me. I was barely awake from anesthesia. She said three weeks, and he released me to drive and work full time in three weeks. I wasn<APO>t allowed to move patients, and was told to ask other nurses to carry that part of my load until I could. He wasn<APO>t thinking of me, lol. I take neurontin too, but because I am also afraid of sedation, I take my entire daily dose all at once in the evening a few hours before bed. I consider it a wonder drug for me, it has helped me in many ways. My doctor suggested I take it that way and said she had other pain management patients who used it that way and they still had good pain contol during the day. I won<APO>t go to a doctor who is only interested in doing procedures and injections, because that is not what I want. You may have to find another doctor that fits in with your philosophy of how to manage your pain. Take care, Annette""""Comorbidities"" are whatever else is wrong with you besides this spinal condition. They could be congenital or may have developed later on in your life. I have FMS, migraines, DDD, OA, they are all comorbidities. Take care, Anentte""Do you also have Spina Bifida? I think I missed that in your previous posts, but you mentioned in this one that TCS and Chiari seem to go together in Spina Bifida patients. I would not consent to surgery based on what the place in NY says, I would want a doctor I trusted to also tell me it was necessary, then get a specialist to agree with him. Take care, Annette""I can<APO>t remember if I mentioned it to you in the past or not (it is easier to type it again than to go look back through all the posts), but you might have a neuro-radiologist look at your films/scans. They are radiologists that specialize in reading films/scans that are of the brain and spinal cord. My husband had one when he had a sub-dural hematoma and he was very helpful and explained things better than the neurosurgeon. Take care, Annette""I would get in to see your pcp as soon as you can to have this swelling evaluated. It is always possible to have something else, even though we have a chronic pain condition. Don<APO>t get in the habit of just lumping it all together, unless you have had your chronic condition for many years and are positive you know what is going on. Take care, Annette""I hope you have made an appt. with your doctor to care for this and to document it. Take care, Annette""Hi, Gail I am SO glad to hear that things are going so well. Don<APO>t overdo it and end up being sorry later. I would agree with the anesthesiologist about staying on Neurontin as a preventative to keep the RSD away. It intuitively sounds right. I guess there is not much medical research in this area yet, maybe you will be the case subject of an article for the journals? It is wonderful to have you here in pain or not, preferably not, because you can teach newer people so much. You have been through a lot so far, and can give hope and inspiration to others with RSD or any chronic pain condition. Hugs, Annette""Yes, I do have FMS. My pcp takes care of me for now. The rheumy was a new doctor for me, my pcp just wanted me to see a specialist about these bumps. They are not in the joints, but alongside the bone between the last two joints of my fingers. They don<APO>t really hurt, just when one of them gets really big, it feels tight. But, it has shrunk down again so all is well. My pcp said I could go see a hand surgeon who would probably want to cut them out and biopsy them, I declined. So she suggested a rheumatologist. This guy is the boss of the rheumatology clinic at a big hospital with a good reputation so I think I am in good hands. He did say it looked like I had very minor OA in the end joints of my fingers of the right hand. News to me, lol. No pain that I have noticed, and no swelling that I can see, but he felt he could see some minor swelling. You are talking about the Canadian Vancouver, right? We have a Vancouver too, here in Washington State just north of us. My son played a year of T-ball when he was a little kid. He really didn<APO>t like it but I made him finish out the season. He liked playing ball in the street with the neighborhood kids, baseball, basketball, football. He is in his 30s now and has a 4 year old of his own. I have found that when I suck it up and go somewhere, even if I didn<APO>t feel like it, I do get benefit from it. I have a good time and get out of the house. I do plan rest and recovery days afterwards to pay for the good times, but it is worth it. I mowed the lawn today and pulled some weeds, just before it started raining again, and again, and again, lol. We haven<APO>t seen much sun here yet this year. You have a good weekend. Take care, Annette""Gail, Please don<APO>t worry about my fingers. The rheumy said it wasn<APO>t anything he had ever seen before. The placement of the bumps are odd, as they are between the last two joints on the fingers, not the joints themselves. The first one I noticed was xrayed 2 years ago and it didn<APO>t show anything bad. My pcp suggested I see someone now because I complained to her that I had several bumps now including one on my wrist over my radial pulse point. She said I could go see a hand surgeon, and he would do surgery and remove them, I passed on that since they don<APO>t bother me that much right now. So, she suggested a rheumy to see if it was some form of arthritis. This new guy, who I liked and seemed very thorough, had me get xrays to compare with the old one and I will go back and see him in August when he gets home again. He said he wasn<APO>t that concerned as they don<APO>t cause any pain, and the main one has actually gotten smaller again since I made the appt. to see him a month ago. He said if I wanted to I could see a hand surgeon and have them all biopsied just to ease my mind. I declined as I am not that worried, lol. I am so glad your recovery is going well. Are you putting weight on that foot yet? A guy I know actually said he had to learn to walk again after having his little toe amputated. He said his doctor told him that the little toe sends pressure messages to your brain that tell your brain what position your body is in, like little outriggers. He described it as very strange, but once he got going, he never missed it at all. I think you should get a discount when you have a pedicure, lol, it is only fair. I am not sure, but I think it has been my experience as a nurse that when RSD spreads due to a surgery it happens right away, maybe Transcriber52 knows more about it. She is a neuro nuse. I think that you are not having increased pain now is a very good sign. Give yourself time to get back on your feet, then you can talk to your doctor about a weaning schedule for your meds. Go slow is my only advice for that. My brother is doing well, he is sober and in Santa Fe. He has had some medical stuff taken care of, and a tooth pulled. He found a good therapist that he really likes. The fact that he is doing well, really lifts my spirits. My son was approved for a 90% medical disability from his time in the Marines in Iraq and Afghanistan, he was at a 60%, but they bumped it up due to a traumatic brain injury that causes headaches and ringing in one ear at times. That happened when an RPG was shot into his mess hall, he was walking around, but had no idea what was going on. He basically had his bell rung. Fortunately, it was all documented in his military medical file. This rating improves his benefits considerably and covers a lot of his medical care through the VA. They have great private insurance now, but he likes the VA near him and uses it because they seem to be more sensitive to his injuries in the past. They just have more experience with such things. I will wait until this guy gets home again, but if they get worse and start hurting or anything like that, I will see someone. At this point, they don<APO>t hurt, and don<APO>t affect my ability to use my hand, they are just there, and it bugs me not to have figured it out myself. Anyhow, I am fine. I don<APO>t mind a bit if you pray for me, every little bit helps as far as I am concerned. Hugs, Annette""My son did not consider himself disabled as he manages to work full time training Marines for combat with a civilian contractor. When he got out, I made sure he documented everything that went wrong with his body during his exit physical just to be on the safe side. That got him a 60% rating, but one of the doctors at the VA were he goes put the symptoms together as to his headaches, ringing in one ear and partial hearing loss as a traumatic brain injury (TBI) from the rocket attack and that bumped him up to 90%. The best thing is it insures that both his boys will get their tuition paid at Calif. State colleges and universities. His monthly benefit also gets bumped up so they are looking for a house to buy. I am very proud of his service, but I don<APO>t talk about his personal stuff much. What is frustrating is that he was in the original invasion in Afghanistan and I have photos of him in certain cities after the US and the Northern Alliance ran the Taliban/Al Quida out, and now the US is fighting to win them back AGAIN from the Taliban. Don<APO>t sweat the fatigue yet, I complained to my surgeon after 4 weeks that I was just exhausted and didn<APO>t know how I was going to go back to work at 6 weeks. He explained that some of the sedatives and anesthesia drugs they use in surgery attached to my fat cells, and then are released slowly over 5-6 weeks, and they contributed to me feeling that way. He said I would feel better after six weeks post op and I did, it was like night and day. Were you anemic before the surgery? That will also make you feel tired out. My husband was on methadone and oxycodone/APAP prior to his THR, the doctor let me taper him off the methadone as soon as he wanted to get off, a week or so after surgery. I did it in about a month or 6 weeks. He said he never felt a thing. Please don<APO>t worry about my hand, I am not worried at all, I shouldn<APO>t have said anything. Hugs, Annette""Hi, Kerr They are just small mobile nodes between the joints. I am really no worried about them, I saw a rheumy and had some xrays done, we will see what they show. They don<APO>t cause any pain, so don<APO>t worry. Take care, Annette""Just writing to see how you are feeling? I saw a rheumy yesterday about some bumps on my fingers, of course he said he had no idea what they were. But he did a very thorough history and physical exam. Any how he isn<APO>t worried about cancer or anything terrible, but got xrays that he will go over with me in Aug. when I go back to see him. He is going out of the country for a month meanwhile. I could have gone in to see him just before he left at 8 AM, yuck!! I am just not a morning person, lol. I feel better knowing that at least I don<APO>t have to worry. I hope all is going well with you since your surgery. I am thinking of you. Hugs, Annette""I take neurontin and I love it. It has been a wonder drug for me. The side effects for me were a drunk feeling the first few hours after I took it. I take my total daily dose a few hours before bedtime all at once, instead of divided doses. That side effect went away after a few weeks at a steady dose. I tried Lyrica when it first came out, it was much more expensive, although my insurance covers it. I did have to pay a higher co-pay because it was not available in generic, and did not do any better than the neurontin, so back I went. I truly believe that the chemical difference is so slight that it really is not worthwhile to take the more expensive newer drug in this case, but that is just my opinion. I looked in my drug book for nurses and the side effect of twitching and a change in muscle coordination happens in only 1-2% of users. My nocturnal myoclonus actually was much decreased when I started taking this med for pain management. I used to kick holes in my bottom sheet at night, but not anymore. Discuss your symptoms with your doctor and see what he says. Thank you for your military service. My son was in the Marines for 8 years, and I do appreciate your sacrifice. Take care, Annette""It is impossible to say if you should be concerned about all the swelling without knowing exactly what the injury was this time, and without being able to examine you. Please see your doctor, or go back to the ER if you have no other choice. The key to reducing swelling in an injury like that is to keep the foot elevated higher than your heart most of the time. This does not mean resting it occasionally. Icing it at the intervals designated by the ER doc will help, but that is not all of the treatment. Sitting on the couch and putting your foot up on the coffee table is also not enough, the foot MUST be higher than your heart to really allow your body to reabsorb the fluid in the tissues. When did the ER recommend you get a followup appt. with another doctor? It would be better to see your pcp or family doc for a followup than to not see anyone. If you have no other option, go back to the same ER. Take care, Annette""By telling me what happened, I did not mean the Dr.<APO>s diagnosis, you told us that already. I meant what exactly did you do to injure yourself, a ground level fall, a twisting injury, falling down stairs, etc. By visualizing the actual injury it is easier to guess just what happened in your ankle. Your ankle/foot does not care why you don<APO>t have time to elevate it. I understand, I was a single parent for ten years. The pain/swelling will continue until it goes away, and it will go away faster if you keep it elevated. That is just basic physiology. If the ER doctor told you to follow up with an orthopedic doctor, the ER should have given you a name to call to make an appt., it would be on your discharge instruction sheet. Did they? It is not a waste of time if they told you to get it rechecked. Take care, Annette""That really does help me understand better what is going on with your ankle. That is usually called an inversion injury if you twisted it so that your foot went towards the inside, this can cause very serious sprains/strains. I don<APO>t know where you live, but in the states where I have worked as an ER-RN, the doctors who were put on the ER call list for referrals had to accept public aid or cash for at least one followup appt. if their name was given to a patient for followup. If they refused to see an ER followup patient that came in while they were on call, they would get in trouble with the hospital and possibly lose their on call privileges. Orthos make lots of money off of being on the hospital call list. I would call the ER and explain to them what has happened and ask them what they suggest you do. Often they will help you make an appt. for at least one followup visit. If they can<APO>t, then going back to the ER is an option, not the best medically for you, but better than nothing. You can also call the state board of medical licensing in your state and ask them if they have any suggestions. Sorry you are going through this. Take care, Annette""Hi, Katie Glad to be of help. I hope you find an ortho that will see you soon. Keep in touch. Take care, Annette""I can understand your situation, though no one can feel what you are feeling. I suspect it is just as well that you did not have any kind of surgery, it seems to fail more often than it works in the lower back. By disability are you talking about SSDI or state disability? SSDI is a federally run program, but it usually takes at least 18-24 months to get it going. You have to keep appealing it when they turn you down. But if you keep after them it seems like about 85% of people eventually get approved. If you have no income and few assets other than your cars and your home, you might qualify for Medicaid. You aren<APO>t going to get Medicare until two years after your official date of disability once your SSDI is approved. It sucks going without health insurance. I don<APO>t know how you will get your intrathecal pump filled. One person that posted here a few years back switched to methadone by mouth when she lost her health insurance and could not get her pump filled. You might check that out before you actually lose your insurance. Get a good lawyer to manage your disability, I know we nurses are really smart and often think we can do it by ourselves, but a lawyer who is familiar with the SSA hoops and how to word appeals, etc. is really helpful. I don<APO>t like to get into the whole ""God"" thing, but God didn<APO>t leave you anywhere, if you believe in Him, He is still there to support and comfort you. He gave us each our own abilities and worth, and I believe that He then leaves it up to us to use our own abilities to take care of ourselves and our loved ones. Make yourself a list of things you have to do, then start doing them, one step at a time. Cross off the things you do and move on to the next thing. Hug your husband, and let him hug you. You will get through all this. I know it seems impossible right now, but you will. Take care, Annette""Swank is right, pain is not normal no matter where it is. See the doctor again if the Cipro doesn<APO>t work for whatever it is you are taking it for. You really did not give us much info. Take care, Annette""Anon<UD>2912 is right, no one here can diagnose what is going on with you. Once you see your GYN you will have more information, and possibly a diagnosis. There are many things that are minor and have nothing to do with STDs that can cause bumps where you describe. Take care, Annette""I assume a urologist has already done all the testing necessary to diagnose you with IC. I would take copies of all that with you along with medical records that show what you have already tried as far as pain management. That way the PM doc knows what you have already tried and can start from there. A pain diary with pain scores and medications, etc. would also be useful. Of course, waiting until the appt. is tomoorow is kind of too late for that. You should have asked this question as soon as you made the appt. Take care, Annette""I tend to agree with Trudy and Country Lady. I would suggest you go to http://www.myalgia.com and do some reading there, see if that seems to fit with what you are experiencing. If it is, print out the info to take to the doctor to discuss. Many communities have free/low cost medical clinics for folks without insurance. Call your local Goodwill, Salvation Army, or Catholic Charities to see if they have any info. Try putting it in a search engine on line also. They do exist because I volunteered at one for nine years. Best of luck. Take care, Annette""You need to work closely with your doctor to figure this out. Have you tried methadone? It is unrelated to morphine, but I don<APO>t know if you will have side effects or not. You can also try non-opioid medications, like a local anesthetic through a catheter into the surgical site. Take care, Annette""All the opioids have about the same risk of dependence/addiction. The rate of addiction is low, less than 5%, among pain patients who take the opioid according to their doctor<APO>s instructions. I switched to methadone from long acting morphine due to the cost factor. Methadone is very cheap, it keeps me out of the donut hole in Medicare Part D. There is also Ultram/tramadol, it is the only drug in its class, works on the opiate receptors of the brain but slightly differently than the opioids do. It has been around for a long time now. Nucynta is a new drug, a NSRI and has another drug in it that I think is similar to tramadol. It is too new for me to recommend it for anyone. I won<APO>t take anything until it hsa been widely prescribed for at least five years, to make sure what the side effect profile is when used long term. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Also levorphanol, and oldie that is coming back into use again. Demerol is out of favor due to the metabolites causing toxicity and even seizures. It seems these serious side effects cannot be dependably expected, they can happen with one dose or twenty. Take care, Annette""In my experience VA care varies greatly from one place to another. My son is a 90% combat related, disabled Vet that served in Afghanistan and Iraq, and he feels he gets good care at the VA down by Loma Linda in Calif. They upped his disability rating from 60% to 90% recently. I an am old retired RN, I have found as I moved from place to place that the VA hospitals had either terrible reputations or good ones. In SF they had a terrible reputation, but my uncle felt he got great care, he was a Korean War Navy vet. I moved to Reno and the VA there had a terrible reputation, but when I moved to Oregon, the Portland VA hospital is great, of course it is currently the only VA hospital in all of Oregon. If you don<APO>t live near Portland, and can<APO>t travel, you are out of luck. The pain management program here is pretty good from what I have heard. All I can suggest is that you speak up, be persistent if necessary, don<APO>t get up to leave until they address your pain. It is terrible that anyone is treated this way, especially our Vets. Thank you for your service, I do appreciate it. Take care, Annette""I personally think that any doctor who does not accept Medicare is of questionable use anyway. Just my opinion. You might ask the surgeon who he would suggest after you have the surgery and see where your pain stands. Surgeons are generally not well trained in pain control of chronic pain, but he may know someone else in the medical community who is. My pcps have mostly managed my pain. You may need another pcp. Good luck with the surgery, maybe it will fix the pain for you. Take care, Annette""I, on the other hand, have nearly always had my pain treated by my pcp and have received very good care. For one year out of about 15, a rheumatologist prescribed my pain meds. I did not want the long acting opiates that my pcp suggested just yet. In my state the state medical licensing board has very specific rules for prescribing opiates to non-cancer chronic pain patients. As long as the doctors follow the rules, they do not get hassled by any government bodies. I got a list of the rules and I made sure I followed them so my doctor would not get into trouble. Now she uses them for all her chronic pain patients. One of the rules is that people with CP have to have a consult by a specialist that agrees that they need opiates. The pain specialist I saw last Dec. said I was ""the best managed chronic pain patient I have ever seen."" A nice compliment for my pcp. The ER ""frequent flier"" lists are from the Dark Ages, they ERs do not use them anymore, mostly because of the HIPAA rules regarding confidentiality, although the ER were I worked stopped on its own about15 years ago. We just did not like the way they were being used, so we got rid of our list entirely. I<APO>ve been on opiates for about 15 years on a daily basis and I have never received a visit/letter/call from the DEA, I think that is a myth. I used the ER frequently due to migraine headaches that were not responding to treatment at that time. Take care, Annette""I am glad you are doing well in your recovery. Don<APO>t overdo things, take it slow and easy. Take care, Annette""Change doctors. I would find a pcp that is more interested in how I feel. I am sorry but most of the things he has suggested you try do not take a month to see results. Making you wait a month between each appt. is crazy in my opinion. Signing a pain management contract is no big deal, but I would also ask for better management. I would tell him what activities you would like to do that the pain is preventing you from doing now. Make it more a matter of function than just complaining that it hurts. He likely will never make you pain free, but you should be able to function on a day to day basis with your pain better controlled. Take care, Annette""How did your surgery go? I hope all is well. Take care, Annette""This is my understanding of the laws from what I have read in my local newspaper. They had several big articles a few years back on this topic. It depends on the state where you live. You should find out based on that. I live in one of the seven or eight states where it is illegal to ""drive while impaired"", not ""under the influence of"". So if I were in an accident, they would have to prove I was impaired while driving due to my meds. I don<APO>t know how hard that is to prove, but it means I can drive while my meds are stable. If I were to increase the dose, I would not drive until I knew how it would effect me. It is legal for each state to make these laws, driving is a privilege not a right. You may be putting other peoples<APO> lives at risk. If it is illegal for you to drive, and there is no public transportation, you either have to get rides/taxis or stay at home. Or move to a different place where public transportation is better. Take care, Annette""My husband lost a job due to a recent history of cancer. He went in for a CT scan and they found out when he asked for a couple of hours off to get the scan. It was clear, but one of the other employees told him they were self insured and did not want the risk of higher health care costs. His cancer did not come back, and he found another job. Even with the new law, you are still including health insurance companies who are in it for the profit making capabilities. I say eliminate the insurance companies and have a single payer, universal health care plan like most other civilized countries do. Health care should not in anyway be linked to your job. Take care, Annette""I would just write in ""I do not take any illegal drugs"" and leave it at that. It is against federal law for any employer to even ask you about health issues unless they have already given you the job. All they can ask you is if there is anything wrong with you that would keep you from doing the job. When I went to the state department of disability and vocational rehab, they told all of us not to give potential employers any more health information than we had to legally. In other words, keep quiet. Take care, Annette""Great news!!! I hope you get the job. This was similar to how it was handled where I used to work. Take care, Annette""It was believed for many years that the promethazine enhanced the pain killing effects of opiates, making them last longer and work better. I believe that I read recently in a nursing journal that studies showed this not to be true, that it was just that the patients were fairly over-sedated. If you still have nausea as a side effect of the Opana, then I would try the promethazine as a treatment for that. I would also beware of driving or using machinery, etc. until you know the sedative effects of using these two drugs together. Do a search on a medical site like Medscape to check for recent (or old) medical studies on the effects of these two drugs used together. Take care, Annette""I use the Lidoderm patches occasionally for hip and leg pain. I have found they are a good tool, when used along with the other things I do. Everything with a positive effect, can have unwanted side effects, so do read the insert and/or talk to your doctor/pharmacist and know what you are trying. I have not used the anti-inflammatory patches, Have you tried them? Some people said they worked, and others said they did not, same as every other med I have ever heard of. It is best to discuss all meds with your doctor. Take care, Annette""Don<APO>t take aspirin along with ibuprofen, only take one of those at a time. Sometimes aspirin does work better for some kinds of illnesses, I would try the enterically coated aspirin, the kind that does not melt until it gets into your intestine. That helps protect your stomach. Everyone has their own pain tolerance. Of course, you can teach yourself to deal with pain to a great extent, only you will know how great an extent. Take care, Annette""You might look into some kind of volunteer work in an area of interest to you. It really helps with the boredom of chronic illness. You can do as much or as little as you can tolerate. Take care, Annette""If all those injections and oral meds are not working, why take them? i would ask the doctor some pointed questions about what works and what seems not to. Although, you may find that if you stop some meds, you will then really notice more pain. But the only way I know of to find out, is to try tapering off under the doctor<APO>s supervision and see what happens. I would not suggest surgery for so many bad discs either, not at this time anyway. But, you might get a second opinion and see what someone else says. Take care, Annette""Avinza is a long acting morphine. It delivers 30 mg. over 24 hours. This is a typical starting dose for someone who has not had a lot of experience with daily opiates. If you find it does not control your pain, see your doctor and ask him when and how much to adjust it. I took a generic long acting morphine for about ten years, and had very good relief from it. I changed to another drug only because the other drug was cheaper. I always use generics. The generic long acting morphine must be taken twice a day, rather than once a day, but that was okay with me. Take care, Annette""I would call the manufacturer on the bottle at their 800 number and ask to speak to someone in the adverse effect department. These are the people who respond to all the complaints about drugs, they should have some idea why this is happening, and what to do. Take care, Annette""You should also mention this to your doctor. He may be able to adjust the BT med to what works for you. He also needs to be aware of exactly how you are using your meds. Take care, Annette""The number of mg. is the dose, so Opana IR 5 mg. would be half the dose of Opana IR 10 mg. by weight. mg. stands for milligram (one thousandth of a gram or 1,000 mg. = 1 gram). It is not the number of mg. that is important, what is important is how it works for you. I believe in using the lowest possible dose for as long as possible, then increase it only enough to make it work again. That is just my opinion though. Take care, Annette""I am a little confused, you want to reduce the volume of meds, but then you ask about how to get yet another med to either augment or replace a med you are already on. I would suggest trying cognitive behavioural therapy for the depression, chronic pain, and anxiety, and see if you can get off of some of your meds or at least lower the dosage/frequency. Of course, I do not suggest you do this without discussing it and planning it out with your doctors. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t have RSD. But, I have read that early intervention with PT and nerve blocks gives the best chance at recovery. Perhaps the floor scrubbing is the equivalent of PT. I would get more than one opinion on RSD because it can be so terrible if untreated. Take care, Annette PS, Let us know how things go.""Gail has great suggestions. She has first hand experience with RSD. Take care, Annette""Congrats on the birth of your child. When you say the pain is back, was it gone during your pregnancy? You implied you only had a limp after the accident. Perhaps the pain is not related to the pelvic fracture, but is related to the pregnancy? Discuss this with your doctors. Take care, Annette""I would go see the ortho doctor who took care of you for your fractured pelvis after the accident, and explain to him that you have had pain ever since, but now, since your pregnancy it is worse. If he can<APO>t help you, he should be able to refer you to someone who can. Take care, Annette""Everyone is different. Your dad may have been able to return to normal after his surgery, you may not. I had C5-6 disc removed and the next one down herniated 6 months later. I opted to let it heal on its own. I didn<APO>t have surgery and things did get better after about 18-24 months. I still get numbness in my hands when my head/neck is in a certain position. Do you smoke? If so, quit if you can. Fusions often do not take when the person is a smoker. I bet it was the surgeon who said there is nothing he can do for you. All he means is there is no surgery to fix you. If you want to, see a second surgeon for another opinion. Then see a pain management doctor or your primary care doc for pain management. There are a variety of things to do for the chronic pain and depression. Have you stopped losing weight? I have lost about 33 pounds in the last year or so, no diet, no depression, no medical cause. I am glad. But your weight loss is concerning, that is a lot of weight to just drop. Has your pcp run the usual labs to make sure your body is okay? Take care, Annette""I will be very blunt, but please do not take offense. Your neck will probably not heal as long as you smoke at all. It may not heal anyway, but we don<APO>t know that, and won<APO>t until you quit smoking completely. A puff or two here and there feeds your nicotene addiction, but it is not a muscle relaxant, and it does inhibit healing in the bones and other tissues. If you are that addicted to smoking, I would also be concerned about pain meds and valium leading to addiction for you. Be very careful with them too. I don<APO>t know if you could manage the trip to Mexico or not, only you can answer that one. But, I would push myself to go, plan the time carefully so you have times to rest and recover, and do not do too much in any one day. I bet the pleasure would be worth the pain. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Ditto what Geraldine said. Just keep trying different things until you find the one that works for him. Work with his doctor, and you might show your dad how to keep a pain journal. Take care, Annette""If you were fine after the surgery, and didn<APO>t have the throat irritation until several months ago, it may not even be related to the surgery. If you have had irritation ever since the surgery that would be different. I would see my pcp first, and if he can<APO>t figure it out, I would ask for a referral to a specialist, like an ENT doctor, etc. Take care, Annette""I would discuss with your doctor whether or not taking a pain pill about a half hour prior to eating would be wise, since you know you will have increased pain when you eat. That alone might help. Always discuss your meds and responses to them with your doctor prior to changing anything. Do what he says, not what we say on line. Take care, Annette""I hope you find a doctor who can listen to you and treat you accordingly. Unfortunately, there is no way to prove you have pain. Doctors just have to listen and do an exam, look at diagnostic imaging and figure out what to do next. Mainly it is a matter of listening to people when they tell them about their pain and how it affects their life. I would also suggest you read ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"" by Dr. Margaret A. Caudill, MD, PhD. I have found it very helpful over the years I have had chronic pain. Take care, Annette""I think the Doctor answered this question when he said no one knows which patients it will help and which it won<APO>t and how best to decide. Take care, Annette""You need to see your doctor to get a diagnosis. He will do a medical history and a physical examination. He may ask you to go for some kind of imaging like a CT or MRI scan. I recommend against trying to diagnose yourself on line, it is often inaccurate. Take care, Annette""See your doctor and get a real diagnosis. Take care, Annette""if the pain is only in your legs, you can eliminate fibromyalgia, as that must occur above and below the waist, on both sides of your body, for at least three months. The rheumatologist should know how to do the FMS tender point test also to rule it out. The rheumy is also the expert when it comes to RA, have you had a blood test yet for RA? I would stick with the rheumy for a diagnosis, as you are describing joint pain and they are the experts in joint pain. ""Diffuse arthragia"" just means widespread joint pain, it is a description of the symptoms, not a diagnosis of what is causign them. I don<APO>t know what your other health issues are, so it is hard to know if they are part of this or something different, the doctor will help you figure that out. Take care, Annette""A low dose of oxycontin may not be equivalent to the methadone you currently take. Considering that in just three years you went up from just lortabs 3x a day to 60 mg. of methadone a day plus a percocet for breakthrough pain, I would not ask for an increase in opiates or even a change to a different opiate. You have to remember that you may need to be on opiates for decades, and if you get to too high a dose, no doctor will keep prescribing it. People forget that there are non-opiate meds that can be taken along with opiates to help relieve pain. You didn<APO>t mention any of the adjuvant meds like antidepressants, antiseizure meds, or muscle relaxants that are frequently taken along with the opiates. I use some of these meds along with my opiates, they have allowed me to keep my opiate doses down for well over ten years. I would not opt for a SCS or a pain pump, no surgeries for me, thanks anyhow. One was enough. Nor would I opt for injections of any kind. I have DDD with herniated cervical discs, FMS, and migraines. I use all oral meds. I use a hot tub daily so the fentanyl patch is not for me either. Take care, Annette""The thing with heating pads is they should only be put on top of you, not under you. Under you can cause burns and even fires. If you use one on your back, that means laying on your belly or on your side with the heating pad draped on your back. We use a heated mattress pad, dual controls for my hubby and I. He leaves his on all night, I just heat up the bed and get in and turn my side off. Maybe that would be better for your back than the heating pad, it is made to be underneath your body<APO>s weight. Heating pads are not made to be underneath you. A suggestion for the bath tub, I used it before I got the hot tub. I would fill it up and take a large towel in the water with me. I would soak it in the hot water, then lay it over any exposed skin to keep me warm. Just keep re-soaking it as you lay there and replace it on any exposed skin. Bath tubs are not deep enough to put all of me under hot water. I would also add hot water frequently to keep the water warm enough. I like about 104 degrees. It sounds like you have the other possible drugs covered already. You might discuss them with your doctor to see if you need to change any of the meds or alter the doses. Lidoderm patches are the only non-generic meds I use. I feel perfectly comfortable with generics, I have used them when available for my entire adult life and never had a problem. Take care, Annette""Recommendations for specific doctors aren<APO>t allowed here. The best way to do this is to email each other and give the names, numbers, etc. of doctors privately. I would not post my personal email address here, don<APO>t want to get spam, but it is easy to set up a free Yahoo or Hotmail account to use for online stuff, and keep your personal email separate. Take care, Annette""Before paying for anything out of pocket, especially if it is pricey, I would do the research on it. Ask the makers for evidence based research that shows how it works for folks with your health problems. Do not go by testimonials, you want to see randomised, double blind research that shows it does what they say it does. I have never heard of it myself, but that does not mean anything. Take care, Annette""I did a quick Google search on this and discovered it is a treatment used by chiropractors and the articles I read said it had NO adverse effects at all. My personal experience is if a treatment has enough effect to positively influence your symptoms, it also has the possibility of adverse side effects. I do not believe that most treatments that have the possibility of improving your symptoms, do not also have the possibility of giving you bad side effects. just my opinion. I also would avoid letting a chiropractor do anything to your neck, as adjustments there can cause strokes. A friend of mine had one on the chiropractic table during an adjustment, and left his office for the hospital via an ambulance. it took her three years to recover the full use of her left side. Take care, Annette""It could be the dose or the delivery system. Avinza is delivered slowly over 24 hours, and MS Contin is delivered over about 12 hours. Or the nausea may not be due to the MS Contin at all, but due to something else. Discuss it with your doctor face to face. Take care, Annette""Propanolol does not seem to lower blood pressure in folks with normal blood pressure. I took it many years ago, also for migraines. I had no side effects at all. Please remember that just because drugs cause some side effects, it does not mean that you will get them. If you do have any strange effects, just let your doctor know and he can adjust the dose or change the meds to something else. Migraine meds can take a long time to adjust, you may go through many different ones until you find the one that works for you. I added vit B6, 100 mg. per day and it seemed to lessen the frequency and severity of my migraines that were associated with my period. Other nurses I knew who had migraines suggested it to me. Discuss it with your doctor before you try it. Keep a journal of your migraines, meds, foods etc. and you can go over it with your doctor after a coupld of months. There may be trends that you don<APO>t notice now. Migraines are a challenge but can usually be controlled eventually. Take care, Annette""I<APO>ve had migraines for about 25 years now, I really think that any new or different kind of headache should be checked out by your doctor. A tingling feeling in the back of your head can be caused by occipital neuralgia, this is treatable. Take care, Annette""Inflammatory type illnesses can take months to heal on NSAIDs. You may need to try several different NSAIDs to find the right one for you, although for me, ibuprofen is the one. Costochondritis can take a long time to heal, or may end up a chronic problem, that flares up now and again. It sounds like you have had plenty of diagnostic tests. Sometimes time is what is needed to heal. Four months in pain seems like forever, but it really isn<APO>t that long when it comes to some of these types of illnesses. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t like the plan that Obama put forth for us. It does not go nearly far enough. I believe in a single payer system, with NO insurance companies. Why don<APO>t we get rid of the insurance companies for once and all? They make a profit without doing any real service or making a product. They negotiate with doctors and hospitals, and take our money and give some of it to the health care people and keep the rest for their shareholders. I have basic Medicare and I am happy with it. I think our government should have a single payer system like all the rest of the industrialized countries do, for everyone. Health care is a right, like a basic education, not a privilege reserved for rich people. The people that end up paying for health care are those who have no insurance, but feel like they should pay their bills. They have no insurance company to negotiate hospital prices, they end up paying higher prices than those with insurance. Then they go bankrupt when they slowly try to pay their bills. Or they die for lack of health care. There are NOT programs for everyone. Poor people who must use the ER for basic care because they don<APO>t have money up front for doctors often leave their bills for the rest of us to pay through higher hospital rates. And they get really poor care. There is no FREE care, it all gets paid for somehow. I vote for our taxes to go up and we pay for it, but stop paying the insurance companies. Just my opinion, we all have one. Take care, Annette""[TRIGGER] Do you smoke? That is the main thing that causes lower leg pain due to poor circulation at your age. It usually happens after walking a ways, a block or two perhaps, then stops when you rest for a bit, and comes back when you walk a couple of blocks again. It is called intermittant claudication. You might see a vascular specialist for that. You are not on high doses of pain meds, a pain management doctor might be a good idea if you rule out the circulation problem. They seem more open to higher doses of pain meds than other doctors. The doctor who is prescribing your current pain meds might also be helpful. Please do not consider killing yourself. As brighter minds than mine have said it is usually a permanent solution to a temporary problem. It really messes up your family. My ex was from a family where his mom sat her five kids down to dinner, went in the other room and shot herself in the stomach. Step dad was at work. Died in front of the kids. As adults, two of his brothers and one cousin killed themselves. The cousin was pregnant at the time and they did save the baby by putting her on a ventilator for a few days until they could do a C-section. Family survivors learn that suicide is an acceptable way to deal with problems, rather than asking for help. It is the wrong way to teach your kids. Keep looking for help with your pain, you will find it and be glad you are alive and being a good dad for your kids. I felt like you years ago. Fortunately, I am from a big family and could not find a day to do it that wouldn<APO>t ruin someone<APO>s birthday or a holiday. I found help and worked on things and I am so glad to be alive now. If you ever really feel like you are going to kill yourself, call your doctor, 911, or a crisis line for help. Take care, Annette""No chronic pain is as simple as stopping one bad habit and it will be cured. Usually, you need to modify many things in your life and take several different kinds of meds also. Each intervention may help just a bit, but in total they may all help a lot. But if your pain is related to your circulatory system, you need to quit smoking because nicotene is known to narrow the blood vessels and restrict blood flow to the extremities and the skin. This can cause muscular pain in the legs. Smoking is a nasty habit anyway. It affects so many different parts of your body. Your pain may not improve, but you may be improving your body<APO>s function in other ways. But that is up to you. You have been seeing your pain management doc for five years and you trust him, ask him to refer you to a circulatory specialist just for your own peace of mind. Get whatever testing is necessary done, and you can put your mind at rest, or have a new diagnosis to deal with. I use methadone, and have since last December, before that I used long acting morphine. I asked my doctor to change it to methadone because it is cheaper and I didn<APO>t want to end up in the donut hole of Medicare Part D. It works fine. There is only one side effect that can happen at high doses that I would be concerned about, and I don<APO>t use high doses, so I don<APO>t worry about it. I am very happy with it. My husband also took it before he had his hip replaced a couple of years ago, it worked well for him and he had no trouble at all tapering off of it after he had his surgery. No withdrawals at all. You sound very depressed, so I would talk to your doctor about getting back on some kind of antidepressant therapy, either meds or cognitive behavioral therapy. Just getting depression under control is one part of pain management, you can work on the other issues as well. Best of luck. Take care, Annette""Keep going back to the doctor until you get a RX that gives you relief, or change doctors. It may be that he needs to get to know you so he feels he can trust you, or it may be that he does not know how to treat pain to begin with. Take care, Annette""I had surgery for disc disease at that level in 1992. I did not have pain however, I was losing the use of my right hand, dropping things, etc. It did fix that. I had a blood clot in my leg though, and it required medical treatment for six months, including five more days in the hospital. Six months later the disc above that one herniated. I opted not to have surgery because I was not having functional difficulty. There is very little correlation between bad spinal discs and pain. They did a very large study, over 700 patients, they all had MRIs, and it showed that there were a lot of people who had really bad disc disease and no pain, and others had terrible pain and normal discs, and some had bad discs and bad pain. The conclusion was that MRIs that showed how bad your discs are, are not a good way to tell where the pain was really coming from. We need a better way to choose which patients will be good candidates for surgery. This article was in ""Arthritis Today"" magazine, I think March-April of last year. The conclusion of the article was that folks did just as well without surgery as they did with surgery, at two years after the initiation of treatment. This was just in regard to pain, not other improvements as far as function goes. I would talk to a neurosurgeon and get his opinion on whether surgery would likely help, then get a second opinion from another neurosurgeon who is not in the same practice as the first. I would tell them both that I am just looking for an opinion, not a surgeon. I would also see a neurologist and ask what other treatment options would be available to you. Then I would decide what to do. There are very few cases where this is an emergency surgery, it is usually elective and you have time to decide what to do. Take care, Annette""I have no idea why this happened to you in 2006. Back, years before I moved here from Reno, NV, in 1997, I was being treated for migraines when Stadol was first used for migraines. My pcp prescribed it briefly. I never got it, because he figured out quickly that his patients that did use it ran out early because they overused it. It would have been when Stadol was first used for migraines. The drug reps pushed it as a wonder drug, like drug reps always do. The doctor said patients sometimes went through mild withdrawals when he stopped prescribing it. He was always good about treating withdrawals as an outpatient. He felt that it easily caused addiction, because people did not see a ""nasal spray"" as causing addiction or as being a narcotic. They overused it and often interpreted the ""good feelings"" it gave them as their headache went away as a proper medical use. After awhile, they were sniffing it all the time. I am a nurse, and back in the 1990<APO>s we all knew it was habit forming, or caused dependence and required tapering if one were to go off of it after being on it for a long time at a regular dose. I feel terrible that you went through all this. When you were using three units per week you were certainly using enough to become dependent. One unit has 14-15 doses in it, and it should be presribed no more than every four hours, which is six doses per day. I certainly agree that we should all be aware of all the medical treatments we use and how they work and what side effects are possible. Take care, Annette""I am still registered in two states as an RN. I volunteered in a free medical clinic twice a week for nine years, until a couple of years ago. I have not had paid employment since going on disability in 1999. I worked continuously as an RN from 1970 until then. I do not claim to be anything but a community member who happens to be a nurse. I share my experiences freely. The experiences I shared about stadol and patients who used it, and my doctor who prescribed it briefly have nothing to do with your experience, that was my experience. I have never used it myself. I just shared what I knew, what my doctor at the time told me about his patients that used stadol. I apologize if I offended you in any way. I do hope you are still hanging in there, and will come back and visit again. I welcome any new members to the group. I do have to say that I do not come for visiting, and chitchat. I am in too much pain to sit at my desk for very long. I tend to be forthright, and direct, sometimes people say I am too direct. But, I always have best wishes in my heart for everyone who lives with chronic illness of any kind. Take care, Annette PS, By the way, who are the Zen Brothers???""Again, I did state in my original post that this was my experience with my doctor using Stadol. I was not judging you or your experience. I apologized to you, there is not much else I can do. I am familiar with Zen Buddhism, I have Buddhist relatives. I was just not familiar with the term the ""Zen Brothers"", thank you for the clarification. If you do not wish to post to me personally, that is fine, please do not feel that means you need to withdraw from our community. there are plenty of folks here to talk to. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t think one is necessarily safer than the other. It is pretty normal practice to prescribe what he did to a new patient for a first time (for the doctor) complaint of neck pain. Meloxicam is an NSAID to quiet the inflammation, the flexeril is a muscle relaxant, and the darvocet is about the weakest opiate available. I get no relief from it, but some of my friends say they get great relief from acute pain using it. The itching is a common side effect of all opiates, and should go away soon. As far as his comment that it would be malpractice to prescribe hydrocodone with your present meds, you would have to ask him directly what the interactions would be that he is concerned about. I took a class in managing pain given to healthcare practitioners, nurses, doctors, and pharmacists to get our licenses renewed last year. The instructor of the class, who seemed to know what she was talking about, said that recent research that had not been published yet (back then) showed that using opiates and benzos together was ill advised, the interactions were very dangerous. She said in her opinion, the general medical practice would soon be to not ever prescribe opiates and benzos together. I worked at a methadone clinic for heroin addicts many years ago, we also saw some bad interactions when clients found doctors willing to write them RXs for benzos, so we made it a rule of the clinic that clients could not take benzos at all. Even back then, some 40 years ago, there were other meds that one could use rather than benzos. There are more available now. Your clonazepam is a benzo. Maybe he is hesitant to prescribe the hydrocodone, an opiate, while you are taking that. Maybe it is something else, ask him. He will probably tell you what his thoughts are. I hope your neck feels better soon. I have neck issues with herniated discs, I use ice over a towel on the neck/shoulder when I have pain there. I also use my hot tub for pain relief. Try whatever you can while you and he decide what to do next drugwise. Take care, Annette""Hi, Gail How are you doing? What is going on with your pain from the surgery and from the RSD? I hope things are quieting down now. Hugs, Annette""Hi, Gail I can<APO>t remember your usual morphine/percocet dose, but one week sounds too fast for me for anyone to taper off of long term opiates, without going through pretty strong withdrawal symptoms. The good news is that without any increase in pain, assuming the amputation has worked fairly well, opiate withdrawal is not any worse than a ""bad case of the flu"" according to old heroin addicts I have known, it lasts a couple of weeks, and it is mostly over with. The bad news is there is really no reason you should have to go through it at all. You know how I feel about leaving messages and doing the whole phone tag thing with doctors about pain meds. In my experience, it just doesn<APO>t work unless you happen to get to speak to the doctor directly. That rarely happens. I think you have to arrange for a ride to get in to see someone. I would call the doctor<APO>s office FIRST thing Tuesday morning when he gets back, and ask if he can see/talk to me personally or should I go to the ER. I wouldn<APO>t give them more than those two choices. When you do get to see him, start with the bad news first rather than starting out with telling him how well you are doing since the surgery. I have read that with the average doctor you only have about 30 seconds to state your case, it sounds like that is true with this doctor. Then they have already started thinking out your treatment plan and do not hear anything more. Sad if that is true with most doctors. He cannot treat what you don<APO>t tell him about, so tell him first thing. You can tell him the positive things afterwards. Start out by telling him the most important thing on your agenda. Take notes right in front of him, let him know you want to get it right, ask for explanations as he goes along. Make sure you TELL him your concerns about the RSD flaring up if you withdraw too quickly. I don<APO>t know if that is a fact or not from any experience I have had with patients, it never came up. I have read that to minimize withdrawal symptoms generally it may be best to slowly taper off of narcotics, about 10-15% of your total daily dose per week. I would want to start with my long acting opiates, and use the BT meds as usual, then taper off the BT meds. But, he may have a perfectly good rationale for doing it his way. It probably does not really matter which med you taper off of first. You might check on pain.com to see if they have any good information for doctors regarding this topic. I think you are doing great!!! Hang in there through this important part of your recovery. Keep your eyes on the prize, in a couple of months you will be done with all this and feeling much better. It is early days yet. Hugs, Annette""The doctor should have given you a number to call in case of emergencies, if not call the office number and they will direct you as to what to do next. Did they suggest icing it or taking tylenol or anything as after care? Take care, Annette""You need to go see your doctor or a neurologist. Any new or different headaches or head pain should be sorted out promptly by a professional, not on line. Take care, Annette""Call the doctor who did the procedure, make an appt. and discuss this with him, preferably face to face at their office. Did he discuss clots with you? Did he give you a list of symptoms for which he recommended immediate care? Take care, Annette""Only your treating doctors can examine you and actually take a good medical history and examine your MRIs, xrays, etc. I agree with the doctor who suggested you avoid surgery at this point. We all wish there were a pill or a surgical procedure that would take us back to the way we were prior to our injuries, but that is not always possible. I think because it is less than two years since your injury, I would opt for the least invasive treatment and see how much healing your back can do for itself. As far as the meds go, I would suggest you see a pain management doctor who manages pain with non-invasive means (no shots or invasive procedures). Give all the meds he suggests a good try. Most meds are given one month<APO>s supply at a time, you may need to try increasing the dose or altering the timing of the medication, so it might take longer than one month on a med to see how it will work. Even if it just lowers your pain levels a little bit, it might be worthwhile to stay on it and see how it works in conjuction with other treatments. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Come on, I was gone one day!!!! No complaining until we say hello. Sounds like you have a lot on your plate. I would make a list and put the most important thing to YOU at the top, then list the other things you need to take care of. Just start at the top and do one thing at a time. You don<APO>t get to put big projects on this list, nothing like ""Cure my diabetes."" Put things, like ""Lose 10 pounds."", or ""Walk 50 yards a day."" As you cross off the items you should feel stronger and stronger and better about life in general. Discuss this with your doctor, and make sure everything on it is okay with him. Meanwhile, visit here anytime, and vent all you want. If you don<APO>t want any advice, say so in the heading, say this is just venting, no help needed, or something like that. We tend to be pretty goal oriented and straightforward with suggestions. Take care, Annette""I agree with Swank. Old tests from ten years ago, may have changed. Often I have read that with these diseases you will have a negative test at first, and later on the test will come up positive. I also agree that he should see a rheumatologist for right now, they are the best doctors to evaluate for RA and Lupus. Take care, Annette""I am glad you have found good doctors who finally diagnosed you. However, I don<APO>t think the DEA has rules that prohibit your rheumatologist from giving you certain pain meds. The DEA is a federal organization, so their rules would apply to all doctors in the US. My pcp/internist gives me methadone and generic Norco for BT pain. It was a rheumatologist who gave me daily opiates to start with. There are only one or two meds that the DEA says doctors must have special training to prescribe for addiction treatment. I think that some doctors who don<APO>t want to give out opiates, tell their patients that it is the DEA that stops them from doing so. That way they don<APO>t have to take responsibility for their own actions. You can go to the DEA website and find out what their rules are about pain meds. Just my opinion. Take care, Annette""You need to see your medical doctor. Please avoid the chiropractor for right now. You really need to have some kind of imaging done to see how your spine is doing, and a definite diagnosis before you get any more adjustments done. Once you are confident that you know what is going on, it is your decision to make. A good friend of mine, another nurse, had a stroke on the chiropractor<APO>s table during an adjustment to her neck. She had to go to the ER by ambulance directly from his office. It took her three years to get the right side of her body working properly again. I have since read a journal article that says adjustments to the neck can cause a tear in a vertebral artery that rips up into the head causing the stroke. I have a bad neck, DDD of the cervical spine and have had one discectomy, my husband<APO>s chiropractor told me to never let a chiropractor near my neck. He said they can<APO>t fix it and some would go ahead and say they could and could really hurt me. Congrats on training for the triathalon, I cannot even imagine doing that. But, I know how runners are, they tend to ignore the bad things their bodies tell them. Any kind of new pain is your body telling you to take care of it. Please do. Take care, Annette""Ditto what he said!!! Get her to a doctor and have her sugar levels addressed. High blood sugars can over time cause the nervous system problems and can cause pain and tingling in the hands and feet. Take care, Annette""Best of luck, let me know how it goes. Take care, Annette""She probably has no other choice but to go to the free clinic at this point in time. I used to volunteer at one, I did it twice a week for nine years. It was first come first serve, unless someone came in that was clearly urgent then they got bumped up. A triage nurse made that decision. I have never heard of seeing Mexicans first. Sounds more like one of those urban myths. We didn<APO>t go home until every one had been seen for that night. It was often 10 pm or later. We were not paid, we were strictly volunteers, the doctors, nurses, and front office staff. Check on line with Google and see what free/low cost clinics are in your area. Volunteers in Medicine have clinics all over the US, you might be able to find one there. Some counties have clinics for primary care, it can take a long time to get in, but once you are a patient they don<APO>t kick you out unless you just don<APO>t show up. She should try for whatever she can get, she should fill out applications for any kind of help she is eligible for. If she is accepted and already had something else, she can decline then. Unfortunately, when you get on SSDI, Medicare doesn<APO>t start until you have been declared disabled for two years. It takes some us that long to get approved, so the Medicare starts right away if the date of disability goes back far enough. It did for me. It is a money saving thing, I think they hope we die off and never get on. I am on just the old fashioned Medicare, and I am very happy with it. Best of luck to you both. Take care, Annette""Hi, Dave I don<APO>t think we have spoken directly, I just wanted to tell you that it is great to have you here. You offer good advice and suggestions. I know it saves me a lot of time if I come on line right after you, because you have already said what I would have, so I don<APO>t have to, lol. I am always sure to read your posts, lots of good info. Take care, Annette""Avoiding your doctor only makes things worse. Please go get checked out, let him know what is going on and how long it has been going on. You may have diabetes, you may not. Right now, you are worrying over something that may or may not be so, that is a waste of energy! Once you know what you have, you can either worry about it, or do something about it. Type II diabetes is what usually happens in adulthood, your body no longer responds to the insulin you make as well as it used to. It is usually treated with diet and oral meds. Take care, Annette""Yes, you can take morphine and dilaudid at the same time. I am not sure why you have headaches now, but I would not recommend Dilaudid for use for headaches outside of the ER. There they just want to make the pain go away for you. Usually with opiates, the headache pain comes back as soon as the drug wears off, as you discovered at 3:30 in the morning. The dilaudid may have worked because you already had a certain amount of morphine in your body, the two have an additive effect. Opiates can cause chronic daily headaches or rebound headaches. It is better to find out the cause of the headaches and treat them with other more specific meds. Take care, Annette PS, I don<APO>t know what you mean by having ""some kind of block or patch installed in my neck""?""Is the pain in his chest or somewhere else? He needs to tell his doctor that the present medicine does not work for his pain. He should be very specific. A pain diary might be useful for him to keep for a week or two. Take care, Annette""You sound awfully young to have fractured both wrists and an ankle and now to be having pain in the other ankle. Unless the fractures were all related to trauma, they might be part of making this diagnosis too. Many opiates make people sick to their stomachs, it usually passes after one has taken the drug regularly for a few weeks/months. No opiate takes the pain away completely, but I would let your doctor know about the nausea with the Vicodin, and the lack of effectiveness of the Tylenol #3. He may be able to come up with something else. Take care, Annette""There is a difference between addictive and causing dependence. Addictive means one is taking it for reasons other than what it was ordered for, like if it was ordered for pain, and one is taking it to get high. Ultram doesn<APO>t give most people any kind of high or buzz, it just helps with the pain, so it is really not addictive. A drug that causes dependence will make your body get used to it, and if you stop it abruptly, you will have some withdrawal symptoms. Many different kinds of drugs cause that, not just pain pills. That is why the labels all say not to stop them without a doctor<APO>s supervision. Ultram does tend to cause dependence. That just means when you want to go off of it, you taper slowly down, and avoid withdrawal symptoms. I used Ultram for about 8-9 years, and tapered off when it no longer helped that much. No problems at all for me. Take care, Annette""I would call and make an appt. with your PM doc now, if the report or the films are available from your MRI by the time you get your appt. all the better, but I would not put off seeing the doctor waiting for the tests. I have been told that a myelogram is really only good to help the surgeon decide exactly where to operate. My neurosurgeon did one a day or two before I had my neck surgery for loss of function in my hands. If surgery is not an option, my neurosurgeon said a myelogram was not needed. I had my myelogram done my an anesthesiologist under flouroscopy, one stick. My personal decision is that I will agree to any tests whose results might alter my treatment plan. I am never going to have spinal surgery again unless I am losing function again, so if my usual pain increased, I would decline scans, but if I started losing function in my hands again, I would consent to some diagnostic tests. I took zanaflex some years ago for back pain, but for me baclofen is the best choice of the muscle relaxants. It seems to work the best with the least amount of sedation. I am very sensitive to sedation as a side effect of drugs. Of course, we are all different, and what works for me, may not work for you. Drugs are something you and your doctor have to work out. It is time for you to stop driving and lifting heavy awkward things until this is dealt with. You know that already, but you don<APO>t want to let the boys down. Your boys need to work out their transportation needs for now. It is more important that you heal from this injury. Take care, Annette""I assume Swank was just trying to tell you that it really does not matter what your diagnosis is on paper, and that with just that written diagnosis, many people would assume you could still do some kind of work. The thing with SSDI is that you need to document exactly what you can and cannot do, how long you can sit, stand, etc., how much you can lift and carry, how often you need breaks, etc. SSA says you are only eligible for SSDI if you cannot to any kind of job in the national workplace that earns you a certain amount of money, $850-$900 a month last time I looked. You can go to http://www.ssa.gov to find out the current limits. I am a registered nurse, but could no longer work in the ER for 12 hour shifts, all that was available for hospital nursing where I lived were 12 hour shifts, and I could not do that. So, I went to home health nursing, and did that for about six months. I explained to my employer that I could not take call or work nights, they accepted that. They loved me and wanted me to work full time, but I stopped when I could not handle it at all anymore. That is when I applied for SSDI. It took 14 months, but I was finally approved at the judicial hearing level after two denials of my claim. When I was accepted the judge put my date of disability back to the end of my ER career, not after my home health work. He said that was a ""failed work attempt"". The unfortunate thing is that most doctors do not document exactly what you can and cannot do, that is not their job, their job is to try and heal you ro make your life bearable. You have to ask your doctor to document your abilities and then make sure he does it. Some specialists are better about doing it, like neurologists and rheumatologists. I went to my state dept. of disability and vocational rehabilitation. I saw a psychologist later on who did a four hour assessment of some kind to prove I was not malingering. Their reports went into my SSDI claim. I feel it is best to have a lawyer from the start if possible. But mainly to keep on with the appeals process. Don<APO>t give up. Take care, Annette""Oh, Laurie, I am so sorry for your loss. Words cannot even describe the feelings I would have if I lost my husband. Come back whenever you feel up to it. Hugs, Annette""I don<APO>t have experience with the VA system, so I can<APO>t be of much help. I don<APO>t understand their logic in giving you a pill with so much more acetaminophen in it, and then telling you to take two at a time, if they are concerned about liver toxicity. Instead of taking 325 mg. with each dose, you would be taking 1000 mg. per dose. I would just tell them it is not working. You shouldn<APO>t come off as an addict. Let him put you on something else, perhaps a long acting opiate would give you better coverage than all these short acting doses do. Methadone is very cheap, I switched to it when I went on Medicare Part D so I would avoid the donut hole. It works fine for me. May or may not for you, but it is worth discussing a change with your doctor. I have found my regular meds do work for other kinds of acute pain, so I don<APO>t know what to say. But, if your regular meds aren<APO>t working for your usual pain, it sure isn<APO>t going to work for additional pain. Thank you for your military service, it is much appreciated. Take care, Annette""Even if they don<APO>t carry other meds right at the VA clinic the doctor should be able to write you a RX for something else, and you may have to pay for it, or go through the manufacturer<APO>s assistance program. It may be that you need to see a civilian doctor again, but that just isn<APO>t fair. Either through a free/discount clinic, or waiting until your financial picture changes. I don<APO>t shoot for pain free with my chronic pain conditions, I shoot for managable pain that I can still function with. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know what the future will hold for you and your back pain. But, if you want to get off the opiates go for it. My husband tapered off of methadone after he had his hip replaced surgically. He had no withdrawals at all with a moderately quick taper. He was lucky that the hip no longer hurt much, but you will have a different experience with your back pain, as you already have noticed. I checked my drug handbook and the suboxone has about an 8-11% risk of constipation in users, so it may or may not be useful for you. You could be one of the ones who do not have that side effect, but since you have had it with other pain meds, you might be more likely to get it with suboxone. I am not a big fan of surgery for back pain, I don<APO>t feel the possible benefits outweigh the possible risks for pain. But there are a lot of other possible treatment techniques to try. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""DDDGuy509, I am behind you whatever you decide. All opiates decrease the peristalsis in the gut, they just seem to nearly halt the bowel<APO>s mechanical action pushing the fecal material forward in many cases. Everyone<APO>s reaction to this is somewhat different, but few people get by without having this side effect at all. I do agree that a different opiate may have less of this effect on you. It also seems to be dose related, so the lower the dose, the less constipation in many people. Alternating to a different opiate often allows one to take a lower dose due to the limited cross tolerance between opiates, so changing opiates may well be of use to you. This is true of both the short and the long acting opiates. You might discuss with your doctor trying a stimulant type laxative, although you probably are already. There are several kinds. Most doctors start with a stool softener, then move to a stimulant laxative, but which kind of stimulant varies from doctor to doctor. Everyone has their favorites. Probiotics and acidophilus work in a slightly different way. They replace helpful organisms that may be lost when you take antibiotics for instance. They may or may not help in your case, but they shouldn<APO>t hurt. Just don<APO>t put of definitive care while waiting for these to work. It DOES sound like you have an awful lot going on right now. Wish there was something I could do to actually help you. Your analogy to quitting smoking is accurate. Like with quitting smoking, I would pick the best time to make any major change in your meds. The fewer other stresses going on in your life the better. Don<APO>t worry what the success rate is with other people in your situation, those are other people not you. You will do fine. Think positively. Take care, Annette""I was gone for a couple of days, just too tired to be on line. I wish I had the answer for your situation, but I don<APO>t. Whatever you decide will be the right thing for you. Just be flexible in your choices, and willing to change your mind if you need to. There is a procedure known as rapid detox, where you are put under general anesthesia, and given IV medications to block the opiates in your system. When all the opiates have cleared, they let you wake up, it is usually done as an outpatient procedure. They claim that you have no withdrawal after that. This costs around $10,000 from what I have heard. I am not sure it is worth it, but it is an option. Again, you still end up with your original pain, so you need to be ready to deal with that. Read all about the back surgery, and seriously study the pros and cons. I would not consider it myself, but that is just me. I don<APO>t think the odds of relieving pain are very good compared to the risks of ill effects. Just because it is not for me, doesn<APO>t mean it would not be a good choice for you. Let me know what you decide. Take care, Annette""I am glad the abdominal issues are better, it may be that your current dose of opiates is lower and that along with the Activa is keeping your bowels moving. Being constipated just makes one feel sick all over, it is miserable. Hang in there with your doctor, take a deep breath, have a list of your concerns ready, and avoid small talk until AFTER the medical stuff is taken care of. I can easily take care of the medical stuff in less than 10 minutes, but all our situations are different. Once you get settled in a med program that is working for you, you won<APO>t need as much appt. time either. Keep in touch. Take care, Annette""I agree with Tom. If you want to get off of them, fine, but do not do it for your family. Many people must take meds for the rest of their life. Diabetics do, asthmatics do, I do. If the research people come up with a cure for what ails me, I will taper off of the pain meds. But, for now, they work. They make me a functional and happier person. I would not even discuss them with your family at this point. You don<APO>t need negativity. Tolerance is a normal side effect of opiates, they will work less well at the same dose over time because your body becomes tolerant to them. You will need gradually increasing doses to do the same thing. This is nothing to be afraid of. Your physical cause of pain may also get worse, requiring an increase in your pain meds. This is between you and your doctor. However, do not blame your doctor for your drug use. It is great that he is willing to prescribe opiates for your pain and try to help you deal with it. But, you put the pills in your mouth, so share the responsibility??? It isn<APO>t a bad thing anyway. My family doctor, an internist, writes my RXs for pain meds. I have always had a family doctor, pcp, do that. I have never gone to a pain management specialist other than to have a consultation to see if we could be doing anything else. The three I have been to in the last 15 years had nothing else to offer, they said we were doing everything right, and keep on doing it. Take care, Annette""Hi, Tom I take a generic, store brand bisacodyl, it is a mild stimulent laxative. Look on the active ingredient list on the side of the package. My husband used Miralax occasionally when he was on opiates. They work for us. I would discuss this with the pharmacist, even though he deals with mostly prescription meds, he is also usually pretty up on the over the counter stuff. Take care, Annette""A lot of folks like the suboxone, I think it is a matter of how you look at things. You are correct, you do generally wean off of it too, but I think I have heard some folks here continued to use it for pain. If it does not make your constipation worse, that might be what your doctor is thinking about. If I were weaning off of all pain meds, I would just go for it, and skip the suboxone. My husband has weaned off of morphine, oxycodone, and methadone at various times in his life. For cancer treatment, and for his hip problems he has taken all kinds of narcotics over the years. He is 66 now. He said he never had any trouble going off when he set his mind to it. No withdrawals at all. I was there for the methadone, so I can vouch for that one personally. If you decide to continue without the suboxone, just go slow and you will be fine. Keep in touch. Take care, Annette""You should do whatever you feel is right for you. I take pain meds, and deal with the side effects. Take what you feel is best for you. This is something for you to decide with your doctor. I found a book called ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"" by Dr. Margaret A. Caudill, MD, PhD to be very helpful. Also ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns, MD. Both books have assessment worksheets that you can pull out and copy so you can watch for a trend in your situation. I consider both of these books to be critical in my treatment. Take care, Annette""Best of luck, it really helped me learn to deal with things better. Take care, Annette""Hi, Tom Sounds like a reasonable plan. Keep in touch, and let me know how things go. Take care, Annette""I am so glad to hear that things are going well with you and your doctor. Enjoy the book. Take care, Annette""I am so glad to see that you are coming out of the tunnel at last. It is certainly a lesson for all of us to be careful with our meds, and never, ever take anyone else<APO>s meds. Expect some ups and downs in your recovery/detox. Are you getting any therapy, going to NA meetings, etc.? Please take this very seriously, and just do the best you can. Addiction is a terrible illness. Take care, Annette""OOPS!! I forgot to mention I love your screen name. Not too many people know about gyrfalcons. My dad was a falconer, and his buddy bought a Swedish Gyrfalcon to hunt with. A beautiful bird. Thanks for bringing me the nice memories. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t really remember his exact dose, he had been on it for a couple of years at about the same dose. It was somewhere close to what you are taking, except he only took it twice a day. The doctor left it up to us to taper as I thought would be okay with my husband. I cut the dose in half once a week, then at 5 mg. a day went to every other day for a week, then stopped it altogether. I would not recommend you to DO anything without talking to your doctor first. My husband<APO>s pain had been fixed by the hip replacement, so we didn<APO>t have to deal with increasing pain. Sweating and heat tolerance were not issues for him. I suspect that as the methadone is cleared from your system the sweating will go away. I would discuss this with your doctor or pharmacist. Please do not do anything without discussing it with your doctor first. Call and ask for a cancellation appt., if someone else calls in and cancels their appt. with the doctor, you get it. Does he have any emergency appts.? My husband<APO>s doctor and mine both keep 2-3 openings each day in their schedule for patients who need to be seen right away. Take care, Annette""I agree with you. Just taper very slowly down and you probably won<APO>t have much trouble other than your pain will probably get worse. I worked with heroin addicts in a treatment facility in the early 1970s. One of the older addicts who had been on and off heroin for many years, told me that the withdrawal is like a bad case of the flu, hot and cold flashes, shakes, bone aches, etc. But that it only lasted a few days. Of course, that was when one stopped abruptly, not with a slow taper. It is great that your doctor is on board with whatever you decide to do. When you get down to the lowest dose of Morphine ER available (I think you may be there already) and are ready to go down some more, he may change you to a different med or a different delivery system, like immediate release morphine pills. DO NOT split the dose of the Morphine ER in half, those kind of pills should never be broken, split, or chewed. You are doing great. When I tapered my husband off, I reduced him to the smallest dose twice a day, then once a day, then every other day, then off completely. Methadone works a bit differently than Morphine ER so your doctor may well have a different plan in mind for you. Take care, Annette""I would see how the NSAID works for your neck after about three weeks, then let the doctor know face to face if it doesn<APO>t seem to be working. Did the doctor do a strep test before starting you on antibiotics? Most adults get viral illnesses that cause sore throats. Strep is actually more common in children and adults who work with kids all the time. I would never take antibiotics for a throat infection unless I had a positive rapid Strep test first. It only takes about ten minutes to do in the office. A regular throat culture can take as long as three days for definitive results. There are a very few people that will always test positive for Strep as they are carriers, and harbor it even when they are not ill. Take care, Annette""You said you had an idea in your mind what caused this pain to start with, did you share that with the doctors? I understand you not wishing to put it out in a public forum, but it is important to share everything with your doctors. Take care, Annette""Talk to the doctor that did the cath, and ask him what to do next. He may well need to actually see you, or he may suggest you go see your pcp. Take care, Annette PS, I hope the procedure went well, and fixed whatever you went to get fixed.""There are a lot of things that can affect how long pain lasts after a procedure like this one. Only your doctor who personally knows you and did the procedure can make this determination with any accuracy. Take care, Annette""The only way you will find out what is going on is to go to the doctor. I am sorry but getting a diagnosis on line is not accurate and anyone who tries to give you is not really being very helpful. It just puts off the inevitable, seeing the doctor. No one likes going, but it sounds like you need to. Take care, Annette""What is the difference? I am not being mean, just honest. I would tell my own son the same thing. Please go see the doctor, for your own good. Take care, Annette""Ditto what Dave said. Take him to the doctor. Take care, Annette""NO ONE should keep medicines in the medicine cabinet in the bathroom. First of all it is too warm and moist for good storage, and secondly, people do steal them when they use your toilet. All medicines should be kept in a locked box hidden away from prying eyes and little fingers. Thieves aside, I would feel terrible if a visiting child got into my meds and was injured. Someone on this board, posted awhile back that a neighborhood adult visited her and stole her opiates and overdosed and died. She was apparently depressed and did what she felt necessary. Too sad. Take care, and be safe. Annette""I have not read or heard of anything from the Obama group that suggests they would make people see additional doctors for chronic pain. Where are you getting this information? I like to think I keep up with medical issues. From everything I had read of Obama<APO>s, I understand that he seems to think that people and their doctors should be allowed to do what they think best without interference from the government. He is working towards making health care accessible to everyone. I believe in that, but would go farther than he has, in that I would eliminate the health care insurance industry altogether, and go to a single payor system. That would save us millions, and improve the health care for all of us. The countries with universal health care are far better than the US is in seeing that their people live longer, have lower infant mortality, etc. than we do. And they do it for less money than we spend on health care. Take care, Annette""I would suggest he see a pain management specialist who also has an addictions specialist in the group setting or that he can refer your husband to if he decides he actually has an addiction problem. Was he using his pain meds to get high or avoid emotions, or just to manage his physical pain? Is his current doctor a pain management specialist? Is he currently under treatment as an outpatient for addiction? I suspect that he may need to use a variety of pain management techniques to control his pain, not just meds. I would suggest he read the book, ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"" by Dr. Margaret A. Caudill, MD, PhD. I found it very useful and so have others. Take care, Annette""We all react differently to the same things. If my husband told me I was acting strangely or bizarrely I wouldn<APO>t get upset at all, to me those words just mean I am behaving differently than usual. I don<APO>t find them hurtful or insulting, I would just do like you did and ask him exactly what he means and to give me examples. That said, I know there have been times in my 20 year marriage when I just had a gut feeling, I would not have been able to give examples of behavior either. So I guess I can see both sides of this. I am more concerned that you have told him that YOU find these words hurtful, and he keeps using them. If he really understands that saying those words hurt you, he should stop saying them. I have behaved strangely due to meds, and when my husband gave me specific examples, I denied it entirely, told him HE was crazy. Then I wrecked my car, no meds at all for over 12 hours. So, I didn<APO>t blame it on the meds, but it did make me stop and think that maybe he was right. Later I spoke to my doctor and it turned out that one med I was taking had a very long half life, and built up in ones system over time. It could have affected me. I stopped taking it, and my husband said it was nice to have me back again. I found a different med that did not make me ""crazy"", but still worked. I suggest the two of you see a couples therapist together and learn how to communicate more effectively. Both of you need to be open-minded and really listen to what the other says. Take care, Annette""There are a variety of long acting opiates that you could take instead. I used a generic of MS Contin for about 10 years, then switched to methadone because it was cheaper. They both worked great and I have had no side effects like you mentioned. I would just explain to your doctor exactly what you said here, that the side effects are bothering you, and could you switch to something else without tapering off first. Usually when a patient switches to another opiate, the doctor uses an on-line tool to estimate your dose on the new med. I didn<APO>t have any withdrawal symptoms when I changed over, and I did it even slowed than my doctor suggested (she knew, of course, we had discussed it first). She had given me some latitude in dosing and timing during the changeover. I wanted to stay on as low a dose as possible. I used my usual breakthough meds as necessary. I don<APO>t think it really matters what kind of med one takes, there are no good studies that show any one opiate is more effective than another. Most doctors have certain ones that they use a lot and are used to working with. Be aware that they also all have pretty much the same side effect profile, so you may end up with similar side effects. Some are dose related and will not show up until a certain dose. Some go away with time. Some people just do better on different drugs. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Ditto what Dave said. I think a good therapist would be the best place to start. I don<APO>t have a problem with her gambling once a month as long as she can afford it. But, she might find some kind of volunteer work that is near where she lives. I have found that volunteer work lifts ones self-esteem, it gives one a sense of control over their life, and gives back to the community. There are all kinds of options available where she would not have to be any more active than when she goes gambling. You are a good daughter. Take care, Annette""I hope she at least gives therapy a try. There is a book I have used off and on for years called, ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"" by Dr. Margaret A. Caudill, MD, PhD. You might pick up a copy for her to read at home if she wants to. I was once as depressed as your mom, I used cognitive behavioral therapy to kick my depression. ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns, MD is an excellent book to read about this kind of treatment. It is used for lots of things now, not just depression and anxiety. Both of these books have assessment tools that you can pull out and copy to use to track your progress. I used volunteer work to get me out of the house and moving around more. I still do it. I volunteered at our public library, then as a nurse at a free clinic and now at our local animal shelter with dogs that are ready to be adopted. There are all kinds of opportunities out there. Take care, Annette""Best of luck to you both. Keep in touch. Take care, Annette""It isn<APO>t so much about how long a post is as it is about breaking it up into paragraphs and organizing it. It is very difficult visually for many of us to read a very long, rambling post that is not broken up into paragraphs. Just put your thoughts together in a cohesive package and type it out in paragraphs. You will get more responses that way. We are all just members here, so we try to help each other out that way. If I make my post easier to read for you, I hope you will respond and try and help me. Take care, Annette""I assume that if you have had a migraine for one year, you are under the care of a doctor. I think you should ask this doctor what kind of treatment he would suggest, or ask him for a referral to a neurologist who can recommend a treatment for you. I have also had migraines for many years, and I can tell you that there are a variety of different kinds of drugs giving by IV for migraines. I don<APO>t know what kind you are talking about, or if your physical issues would preclude you from having any of them. Discuss this with your doctor. Take care, Annette""I have had chronic pain for well over ten years now. I assume that the research people will find something to help me, I do not assume I will be like this for the rest of my life, I am only 58, that could be 30 years. I do not feel guilty, I resolved that by always doing the best I can, no one can expect more than that. I am a nurse now retired, and I have taken care of people with chronic illnesses far worse than mine, they raised kids that grew up into fine adults. You can<APO>t always fix your kids<APO> problems, they have to learn to do that themselves, or they will be failures as adults. If you gave your family the choice of living with you or without you, they would opt to keep you as long s possible. This is your depression speaking. My dad died of cancer when I was 18. I would have given anything to keep him with me longer. No matter what his limitations were. I don<APO>t remember the bad times, just the good ones. I know he had some rough times during the chemo and radiation, but those memories do not come to mind. I would suggest a therapist who uses cognitive behavioral therapy. I used this when I stopped working and it cured my depression and taught me how to handle my emotions to prevent further depression. This type of therapy has been shown to be as effective as antidepressants in the treatment of depression in double blind studies. It also works well when used in conjunction with antidepressants. I used ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns, MD. It is available in book stores or online in paperback form. After I moved and no longer had a therapist I used it on my own and found many helpful techniques. Another good book is ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"" by Dr. Margaret A. Caudill, MD, PhD. Both books have worksheets you can copy and use to track your progress. If you get your depression under proper control, your pain scores may go down, or you may find your pain levels easier to deal with. Please talk about this with your doctors. Take care, Annette""Why do you assume that the drug caused your leg pain? Maybe it was the infection for which you were taking the drug, or maybe it was just a coincidence??? What does your doctor suggest is the cause of your pain, and what has he suggested for treatment? I would hate to think you are not dealing with something that could be very serious because you believe it is a drug reaction. Have you had blood tests to show if you are low in Calcium or magnesium? A basic chem panel with show what your calcium level is. Take care, Annette""I am sorry to hear you have blood clots, I had one in my leg years ago after surgery, it was a hassle. I had to stay in the hospital an extra five days, and stay on coumadin for six months. I had to stop taking birth control pills also, not a big deal, I was taking them for perimenopausal symptoms, my tubes were already tied. I switched to plain progesterone pills, without estrogen. I am very glad to know you got into the doctor and were taken care of properly. Take care, Annette""Suboxone has not been around for as long as oxycodone, so I am not sure how anyone could say it was safer for long term use and be accurate. I don<APO>t think it would be accurate to say that everyone will have NO side effects with any drug for 20 years, but everyone is different. If you like and trust your family doctor, and you know your body better than anyone else, I think the two of you are the ones to decide how you are doing. I think the way to figure these things out for myself is I weigh the possible risks and benefits and go with the best tip of the scales. I feel that opiates as a rule are safe for long term use, while being monitored by your doctor. I do not believe that any one opiate is any better or any safer than another, I have not found any evidence based medical studies to show that to be true. Just remember that anyone can put anything on the internet, that does not make it accurate in general, or true for you. If you have a trusted family doctor that you have been going to for years, I would keep my faith there. It is fine to occasionally see a specialist to make certain that you are not missing anything, and to see if there is anything new out there. I do that about every ten years for pain management. Meanwhile, my pcp, an internist, manages my pain meds quite well. Take care, Annette""I have known five women personally who had knee replacement surgery, one had both knees done at the same time (and a hip done a year earlier), two had both knees done at different times, and one had only one knee done. All of them had it so they would be able to walk, not to cure pain. All of them continued to have pain after the surgery, just a different kind of pain. They have all continued to live with this in different ways. Some of them use medication, some opt not to unless they just can<APO>t stand it. Some of them continue to work, some do not. One died from an unrelated breast cancer, but the other four are happy to still be mobile, even if they are still in pain. Their doctors have given them various vague reasons, but none of them very satisfactory. Who wants to hear that they will always be in pain? I hope your husband finds some resolution to this problem. Take care, Annette""You can look at your prescription bottles to see if your meds are made by this company. Or just call your pharmacist and ask him. Like they say in the article, do NOT stop your meds without speaking to your doctor first. Take care, Annette""Having worked in an outpatient treatment facility for heroin addicts many years ago, and keeping up on current addiction statistics, I must disagree. Oxycontin is one of the most serious drugs of abuse currently. It is an opiate pain medicine as most of us know already. Many addicts like the high of opiates and also benzodiazepines, another CNS depressant. Not everyone is looking for a stimulant. Back in 1970 I was prescribed valium for sleep, it gave me the best high I have ever had for about 20-30 minutes before I went to sleep. After a couple of doses, I flushed them all. I could see myself addicted to those. Heroin addicts told me the same thing, the initial buzz they got after shooting up was worth the vomiting that came later, just before they nodded off. Most of them were chasing that initial feeling, not the sedation that came afterwards. Some opiate addicts are what we call dual diagnosis patients. They have some kind of mental/emotional illness that they do not get treatment for from doctors, instead they self medicate with opiates to kill the feelings that they are having. Many addicts who have had non-drug inspired auditory hallucinations in the past use opiates to get away from the voices. I think perhaps we don<APO>t usually shoot up pure opiates in the same way that addicts do. Even in the hospital, nurses are taught to give opiates slow IV push, allowing it to mix with the IV fluid and go in very slowly. Pain meds do produce euphoria, just not the way we use them. This is why addicts crush and snort or shoot Oxycontin IV, they get a better high that way, the drug enters their system very quickly. Most addicts in my experience, do not get high after the first few weeks of addiction, they are just trying NOT to go through withdrawal, they end up using just enough drugs to keep from getting sick. If what you say were true about opiates and addicts, the DEA would not be concerned about opiates being diverted to the streets, and the addicts seeking drugs would not be putting our doctors under so much pressure to get opiates. YOU might prefer stimulents and hallucinagenics, but that is not true of all serious drug addicts. Glad to see you posting, we always exchange a lot of good info and have good discussions when you do. Take care, Annette""Very well said. Take care, Annette""I saw this show also. It was about addiction, she should have another show about chronic pain. I felt she got some things plainly inaccurate. Someone on her show described her vicodin as 500 mg. we all know that is not correct. That is the amount of acetaminophen in the pill. Anyway, it is nice that you wrote your feelings down and sent them to her, I just changed the channel, lol. Take care, Annette""I agree, I have four siblings andmost of them have no idea what meds I take. They know I am disabled due to a chronic condition, but that is about it. Who wants to talk about that stuff anyway? Boring to me. Take care, Annette""I meant boring as a topic of conversation with real people face to face. I come here when I feel like it, and we all offer help to each other. On days/nights when I really don<APO>t want to talk about it, I don<APO>t. When I recognize people here who really don<APO>t want to put in the work to try and get better, I can opt to ignore their posts and move on. Even here I don<APO>t talk much about my own challenges unless it is to help someone else by sharing medication info or other treatments that really do help me. Only my spouse really knows my health stuff, you are absolutely correct in the comment you made about a hug from your spouse being the best thing ever. I don<APO>t do a good cry though, it always makes me feel worse, not better. Take care, Annette""Please, please talk to his doctor about this. It is far too vague a symptom of several very serious things to blow off as a possible side effect. Take care, Annette""1- Check your policy, they are all different in what they cover. If you can<APO>t figure it out, call the company that you bought the policy from and ask. 2- I use them on my legs and my fat hips. They work fine both places. I do not know exactly how deep they go in as far as effectiveness, you will have to try some and see. I figure if they work on my hips, they go in a fair distance. Ask your doctor for samples if he has any, they are very expensive. 3- I do not think they are available in generic yet, check with your pharmacist. 4- I love mine, have used them on and off for about a year or so. Take care, Annette""Yes, you would get in trouble. Your doctors could both discharge you from their care. You need to take your meds EXACTLY as they are written. You probably should not be getting two different RXs from different doctors and using them both at the same time. You should not lie (your word) to your doctors, if they cannot trust you to take your meds properly, they have every right to stop providing them to you. If you take 3 pills a day like you told him you would to compensate for taking extra, you will not go into withdrawals, although you may feel more pain. Better that, than feel both pain and withdrawal symptoms when you run out of meds. If a pain med is not working as written, you go back to the doctor while taking them as written, and tell him. He then has the option of adjusting the dose or adding a different med to it so it does work. You work TOGETHER to fix the problem, you do not adjust the dose or the timing yourself. Did your pain management doctor have you sign a contract saying what the rules were in his practice regarding patients using these kinds of drugs? You do not HAVE to buy pills on the black market, that is a choice you are free to make. You need to be absolutely honest with all your doctors all the time. If they can<APO>t trust you, they will drop you. Take care, Annette""Antidepressants affect the neurotransmitters that carry signals of both depression and pain to the brain. So they often work for chronic pain in addition to being good for depression. They were originally approved for depression, then the doctors who used them noticed their patients who also had chronic pain seemed to do much better wit their pain levels. Research was done, and now doctors use them for both kinds of problems. Pain is perceived and processed in the brain, so most of the meds used to treat it work at the central nervous system level. The antidepressant does not treat the damaged disc, it treats the back pain the person may have. Take care, Annette""Dave, I have known some doctors to tell patients to alternate heat and ice for pain relief. You are correct about the 20 minutes each. If I were the patient, and I wasn<APO>t sure, I would ask the doctor for clarification. Take care, Annette""As often as my doctor suggested. You aren<APO>t going to get medical advice from me, lol. I also used neck traction as ordered by my pcp and found it very helpful for neck pain. I do not know your medical history, I can<APO>t examine you, and I am not a doctor anyway. Take care, Annette""I posted elsewhere today about the difference between addiction and dependence. This person is taking low doses of methadone and I would like to know where you got your info that methadone is ""toxic"" and ""extremely addictive"", I would like to read it myself. I have read about the possible lengthening of the Q-T waves being caused by HIGH doses of methadone, but nothing at anything close to the dose this person is taking. I worked in a methadone clinic many years ago as an RN to treat heroin addicts, and we did not find toxicity as a side effect. We also did not find it difficult to taper people off of methadone as far as withdrawal symptoms went. Methadone is a naturally long acting synthetic opioid rather than a time release opioid like most of the others available now. The most recent article I have read puts addiction at about 5% or less of opioid users who use their meds as prescribed by their doctors. Charles has an article that quotes research more recent at about 1-2%. These are both very low rates of addiction. My husband has taken morphine, oxycodone, and methadone for cancer and chronic pain over the years. When his pain went away, he tapered off of these drugs easily and without withdrawal symptoms. He has no sign of addiction. Take care, Annette""If I were doing okay on the methadone and baclofen and had been on them for 8 months, I would not have a neurotransmitter placed in my back. I have not seen that many people say that the neurotransmitter worked long term, and that they did not have to take opiates any more. But that is just my opinion. You have to decide for yourself. As long as I am being monitored by my doctor to check on any effects of the drugs I take, I don<APO>t worry about them. I have been on long term opiates for nearly 10 years now, and I do use baclofen periodically. I used to use it daily, now only when needed. I changed my long term morphine to methadone last November to cut costs and am glad that I did. It works fine. I truly believe that surgically implanted devices are for when NO other treatment works. As long as meds work for me, I will stick with them. All surgery can have adverse effects, even minor surgery. Take care, Annette""HI, YOU HAVE LOTS OF GOOD INFORMATION. MAY I MAKE A SUGGESTION? SINCE YOU NEED TO WRITE IN CAPS DUE TO A VISION PROBLEM, COULD YOU BREAK IT DOWN INTO PARAGRAPHS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE REST OF US TO READ? I ALMOST GAVE UP AND WOULD HAVE MISSED GOOD ADVICE. THANKS. TAKE CARE, ANNETTE PS, YOU CAN ADJUST THE FONT SIZE ON THIS SITE TO MAKE IT EASIER TO READ.""Regarding mono, the military did blood tests on recruits some years back and found that 95% of them had already had Mono before they enlisted. Many of them did not even know they had had it as it is possible to have a mild case and never even realize it. I personally do not believe there is a connection between mono and fibro. There was a recent discussion on this topic on the FMS Board here at WebMD. My favorite site for information about FMS is http://www.myalgia.com , check it out if you like. Take care, Annette""Ditto what he said. The pill is designed to release its medication slowly over time. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t use cannabis for pain as I found it did not work for me. That said, I read in the newspaper within the last couple of days that the VA in some areas will not count urine with marijuana in it as dirty if the person is taking it for pain as instructed by their civilian doctor in a state where medical use is legal, and that it is up to the VA doctor if he wishes to prescribe opiates to those patients. Before it said that patients with marijuana showing in their urine would NOT be given RXs for opiates as a matter of policy. You might show your doctor<APO>s group an article like this and see if it sways them at all. However, VA doctors are not required to have DEA numbers to prescribe opiates, according to a VA doctor I know who has worked at the VA for many years and does not have one. You could search the DEA website and see if they have a rule like that. It might be true. There is some controversy about giving a patient opiates if he is also a cannabis user, but I don<APO>t know if it is valid or not. They may or may not mix well according to where you read about it. I don<APO>t know that actual evidence based, medical research has shown a ""wonderful synergy between opiates and cannabis"" or not. Research in the US regarding cannabis has not been allowed for many years in great quantity. What research are you talking about? Where was it done? Printing it out if it is valid research might also be useful to take to your doctor<APO>s group. I would opt to use one of the drugs for now, in accordance to your doctor<APO>s policy, and pursue changing the policy of this medical group. That is just my opinion, we all have one. Take care, Annette""I actually got to talk to Dr. Russo on the phone. I called his office and he answered the phone and spent 20-30 minutes discussing pot and migraines with me. He was very informative. Thanks for the link. Take care, Annette""The DEA is a federal agency so pot is illegal as far as they are concerned. That said when I asked a doctor or two or three in my home state (where pot is legal as far as local cops are concerned and they have a system whereby one can use it for medical purposes) about using pot for chronic pain, they all told me to use it ""in moderation"", and they were all prescribing me opiates at the same time. So I do think it is more of a safety issue than a legal one. Just my opinion. Take care, Annette""I would be interested in your sources though. I have spoken to Dr. Russo and he was very interesting, but what he mainly had to say was that the US needs to change the present system so that cannabinoids can be studied properly. According to him the present system makes it nearly impossible to do real testing. I don<APO>t know if you are aware that ""endogenous"" refers to something that is done by the body itself. So the ""endogenous opioid system"" is that system that the human body has within itself that produces things like endorphins. I am not sure what you meant under ""4."" It seemed like you were speaking about the endogenous opioid system then went on to talk about using cannabinoids and opioids together. It confused me out of the context of the entire article. Take care, Annette""A lot of pain management doctors do random urine screens and include marijuana in that screen. If you come up positive for pot, the doctors are within their rights to cut off your RX for opiates and even discharge you as a patient. If your pot does more for you than the opiates, do and you are willing to risk losing the opiates, go for it. I would keep enough opiates stashed to taper yourself off so you don<APO>t have to go through withdrawal. Take care, Annette""I really think that the prohibition against pot is silly. I don<APO>t think it is any worse than alcohol and it actually does have some medicinal value, unlike alcohol. I think the laws need to change in order for decent research to be done in the US. I suggested evidence based research to try and convince your doctors, but if you feel it is hopeless, that is up to you. As far as using pot so I could reduce the amount of opiates I use, I don<APO>t really see the point. Perhaps when I am taking so high a dose of opiates that doctors do not want to give it to me, it might help. I prefer to take the least amount of drugs I can, and adding one to decrease the dose of another wouldn<APO>t be as good for me as adding pot, and being able to eliminate opiates completely. I tried pot for pain many years ago, back before I was on a long acting opiate, and it did no good for my pain at all. Years before that, I spoke personally to a neurologist in Idaho who had written papers about pot and migraines, and he gave me some suggestions. I tried what he suggested too and it didn<APO>t help my migraines either. I guess everyone has to decide for themselves. Take care, Annette""I followed the link on this page to a lecture by Sandra Welch who participated in studies with Marinol (not marijuana) and opiates and she found this effect. However, she only used mice and rats in her studies, not people. I think it will be better once we have clinical trials with humans. Marinol is available now in the US and I am familiar with some folks who have used it for pain, with varying results. If your doctor wants to give it a try, he is free to do so. Take care, Annette""Yes, I think we each have our own list of things that would make this an easier place to navigate. WebMD keeps promising to fix things, and they do make small changes every now and again. Just not the changes that I find helpful. Maybe next time they will change things to make it easier for you or for me. Meanwhile, try and stick it out, there are some really good people here, that is the only reason I keep coming back. Take care, Annette""Thanks for the kind words, they are appreciated. I would like this place better with some changes too. Take care, Annette""Insurance companies are in it to make money, not to pay for procedures that they don<APO>t have to. They make money by denying claims like this. I am anti-insurance companies. I think we should get rid of them all and have a single payer system. But, that is just my opinion, lol. That said, is there medical evidence that these procedures actually work for your condition? Print it out, and follow the appeals process that your insurance company has. Include the printed info that shows they are the accepted treatment for what you have. They may not even tell you unless you ask, but most companies do have an appeals process. Take care, Annette""Hi, Charity I am familiar with the folks without health insurance problems here, I volunteered as a nurse at a free clinic for folks without insurance twice a week for nine years. It is terrible that people here cannot even get basic medical care. I don<APO>t think there is any way of saying we have the best health care int he world, if only insured people have access to it. When I first started volunteering, I would say about 50% of our clients had jobs that just did not offer benefits at all. Nine years later I would say that percentage had increased to about 85%. One client said her employer kept her working just below the hourly limit so she would not qualify for insurance, he would then hire other part time workers to make up the difference. She had not had insulin for her diabetes in one year because she had no doctor. She wasn<APO>t there as a patient she brought her son in. I know there is a time wait for some procedures and surgeries in Canada. Many people wait here too. I worked with nurses over the years that came down from Canada to work, and they all said they would go home if their health required it because they felt they were more likely to get decent care there that they could afford. I am on Medicare now, and I have no complaints at all yet. I have not required surgery, just ongoing medical care. I love to here about other systems and how folks like them. I think we can all learn from each other. Take care, Annette""I agree that costs need to be addressed. At this time, folks without insurance pay the highest price of all for doctors and hospitals. Insurance companies negotiate with them for good price deals because they bring a large volume of patients their way. Really poor people either don<APO>t go to the doctor until late in an illness when care is very expensive, or they don<APO>t go at all. Middle class folks who work but do not get insurance with their jobs pay out the nose for their care, they have no one to negotiate a good deal for them, and the hospitals jack the prices up to cover the lost profits. Not all doctors negotiate with poor people, many simply do not see them. I worked in the ER in Reno, NV for ten years, there was never a pediatrician in that town that would see kids without the parents having insurance or $$ up front to pay for their visits. It was a constant problem for followup for our patients. The rules were if they took call at the hospital ER they had to do one followup appt., and that is ALL they did, they told the patients<APO> aprents on the phone to bring $$ to cover that appt. or not come at all, and after that they told the patient to go to the ER or another doctor. When I moved to southern Oregon, there was a town on the coast just north of Calif. that had not a single doctor willing to take anyone with Medicaid, they had to drive to Calif. to the ER for care if they didn<APO>t have private insurance. I totally understand that doctors to must make a living. I just don<APO>t think that any of our $$ should go to an insurance company that really does not do anything for health care. They do not heal anyone. Take away the money that the insurance companies get and use that for health care. Swank, I think it is great that we disagree on some topics, and still like each other. I hope others who come and read here, will stop and think about what is going on in health care, and do whatever they believe is right. Take care, Annette""I also do not think that the new health care system will work over the long haul. I would have gone even farther and dissolved the insurance companies altogether, lol. Maybe we could have some combination of the systems they have in other countries, like France, Germany, Canada, England, Japan, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, etc. I think Germany has a combination of a public system for basic medical care, and you can buy private insurance if you choose to do so. There was a great documentary about health care on PBS not too long ago. I personally think we could spend less money on the military and other things, and more on our own health care. We are running two wars on credit right now. I would prefer my tax money to go for health care. Just my opinion. My dad died of cancer many years ago and we did not have medical insurance either. My mom paid off his medical bills after he died by paying each creditor $20 a month, as one was paid off, she took that $20 and split it up amongst the others. It took her years to pay off his bills, she was making minimum wage at first and supporting five kids. After he died and she did not have his income, she qualified for Medical for us kids. Nowadays, I don<APO>t know how she would do it as the costs are so high. I use all generic drugs now, and do not have diagnostic tests unless I truly need them, not just to see what is going on. My choice, I am very conservative with health care for myself. I currently have the basic Medicare, and so far so good for me. Many places already have no doctors who will accept medicaid patients, that is nothing new, that has been going on for at least ten-twenty years. My current PCP is in solo practice but shares office space and lab/xray with other practitioners, she said she will be okay. She is an internist and has a mix of patients on Medicare and with private insurance. She keeps her patients if they change to Medicare, but I don<APO>t think she accepts brand new patients who happen to be on Medicare. It is a very complicated situation, but I am so glad that we can discuss it here and still be respectful of each other. Take care, Annette""You and I can agree to disagree, lol. There are lots of countries other than England that have universal health care with a single payer system, we don<APO>t have to use their model. I saw a great documentary awhile back, it compared the many systems in Europe and Japan and Canada. It was very interesting. I don<APO>t know any English folks to get opinions from, but I have worked with lots of Canadian nurses over the years. They all love their system and go home to get medical care. They have the occasional complaint, but so do we all. We ration health care in the US now, only the insurance companies do it, if you are lucky enough to have health insurance. People without insurance just don<APO>t get care, isn<APO>t that rationing? I would rather pay higher taxes than pay the insurance companies who make profits off of people being sick. I know nurses in Canada who have had joint replacements done, and I have known people here on WebMD who say they wait six months to get an appt. with a specialist here in the US. I don<APO>t think President Obama<APO>s plan will help much, but we will have to see how that goes. I respect you very much as a person, so I don<APO>t think we have a problem disagreeing on occasion. Take care, Annette""You are headed to shear head your insurance company appeal!!!! I am not convinced that most of those injections are really beneficial, but that makes no difference at all. You have had them, and you know they work for you! Because I believe their refusal is based on cash flow, I would couch my response in those terms. Let them know how much it will cost them to okay the injections vs. how much it may cost them to treat you with whatever limited medications you can take. Document why you cannot take certain medicines, be sure and write down all side effects, etc. that made you and your doctor come to that conclusion. Have your doctor write whatever documentation is required of him also. I know you can do it. None of us know what the future holds, who knows, maybe a researcher will find the cure for our problems next year. I play this game one day at a time. Take care, Annette""Yikes!!! I just read what I wrote last time. I meant to say ""spear head"" not ""shear head"", although all those clipped heads might be amusing. My husband is bald, so I might not even notice, lol. Sorry about the typo. Take care, Annette""Fentanyl still causes nausea and vomiting in more than 10% of users, those side effects are listed in my drug handbooks. Opiates cause nausea by affecting the brain, not the stomach itself. Many people can take morphine by mouth, but vomit when it is given IV (also bypasses the stomach). Unfortunately, the only way to find out if you can tolerate a drug is to try it. We are all different. Take care, Annette""Some pain meds are available in rectal form. They can be absorbed through the mucous membrane of the large intestine. Hospice nurses know more about this. Take care, Annette""I have the same diagnoses that you do, plus migraines. I have always been able to find good doctors that DO help me, and like helping their patients. What exactly are you looking for? What are YOU willing to do to help yourself? Take care, Annette""Ditto what Swank said. I would not put it off, call right away. If the infection is back you need antibiotics, not Darvocet. Take care, Annette""If your doctor cannot find a reason for your cough, I would ask for a referral to an ENT (ears, nose, and throat doctor). Perhaps they could get to the bottom of this for you. I also had a cervical surgery, mine was about 1992. I had a variety of symptoms after surgery, mostly with swallowing. I found it was most obvious right away and then went away after a few years. If the cough just started several months ago, and your surgery was a year ago, I would not look there first. Keep in touch. Take care, Annette""Of course, there are other people out there like you who have loved ones and chronic pain. I, however, do not believe it is up to your wife whether or not you are on a long acting med. This should be up to you and your doctor. Is she against long acting opiates, or antiseizure meds, antidepressants? My husband is an angel from heaven as far as I am concerned, but my meds are up to me and my doctor. I tell my husband when I am starting a new med, or changing a dosage so that he can be aware of any ill effects that I may not notice. But, I certainly do not expect him to tell me what I can and cannot take. I respect his opinion, but do not ask for his permission. Has your doctor suggested anything that you have not tried out of respect for your wife? It sounds like it is neurological from what you have said, but you did not mention being on anything like neurontin, lyrica, or an antidepressant? These drugs, as you well know, are often part of the treatment for neurological pain. Has the doctor suggested you have anything like trigeminal neuralgia? Or inflammation/irritation of a different facial nerve? I have had great relief from pain and some other neuro symptoms with neurontin, it also helps prevent my migraines. It may or may not work for you, but there are many options. I am an RN, and frankly I would rather my pharmacist take care of my meds when he is not all drugged up OR writhing in pain. I think a long acting med that prevents some of this pain might be a better choice for you than chasing the pain with short acting meds. I would take your wife with you to the doctor to discuss meds if you want to, but the ultimate decision should be between you and your doctor. Please return, having a pharmacist around would be very good for this group. We might be able to help each other. Take care, Annette""I have heard nothing about them being discontinued. The best way to get off of them is to gradually decrease the dose and taper off. You will need to ask your doctor to set up a withdrawal schedule for you. It is possible to taper off with little or no withdrawal symptoms. Your doctor may also want to try a different med, one of the long acting ones. Take care, Annette""Have you seen a gastroenterologist? I believe I have heard that the colon can cause left sided, upper abdominal pain. Take care, Annette""I had hot flashes and sweats a few years back. I don<APO>t remember exactly how long they lasted, but it was no where near six years, closer to six months or a year. I also have FMS, and was going through menopause at the time. I did not use hormone replacement therapy, but a friend of mne did, just for 5-6 months to get past that. She would get up and change the sheets at night because they were so sweaty. Some meds can cause hot flashes/sweats also. So you might talk to your pharmacist and check that out. Discuss the Procaz with him also maybe, before you start taking it. Take care, Annette""Hi, I tried to look this up on Google, and found references to Prozac, also to Procaz on message boards in relation to thinning hair, anxiety, and ADHD. I found no drug company site that explained exactly what it was. Are you certain you have the spelling right? Do you perhaps know the generic name of it? What exactly are you taking it for? I assumed it was for the hot flashes, sweating. Take care, Annette""Prozac is one of the first SSRIs. It might be useful for you. I vote for trying the cheapest possible drugs first, so I go to older generic ones. I work up to the newer ones, and I avoid brand name drugs when possible. I hope it helps you. Take care, Annette""I understood him to mean he broke the bone on the side of the foot facing outwards (lateral side) and injured the ligament on the side of the foot facing inwards (medial side). I agree about seeing a doctor though. Check out the free or low cost clinics in your area. Try Googling for them. Take care, Annette""Go to the doctor!!! The fact that you have survived with this pain for ten years tells me it is probably not a tumor, or you would have died already. Any new or different head pain should always be checked out by a doctor, you are long over due. It may be something easy to treat, and you would have wasted all these years in pain. Take care, Annette""Are you okay? You sound a bit depressed? If you are considering hurting yourself, please call your doctor, 911, or a crisis line. I hope this is a temporary feeling. Take care, Annette""I use a pharmacy inside a grocery store. I put my meds directly into my purse, so I don<APO>t carry any kind of pharmacy bag to draw attention to myself. Then I do my grocery shopping. I don<APO>t think my pharmacy uses a white bag, but it sure has the pharmacy<APO>s name on it. I assume that someone could still stand around the pharmacy and stalk anyone who leaves with meds, no matter where they put them. I can only do so much, lol. Take care, Annette""Was this neurologist an associate of your doctor or was he the on-call guy for neurology at the ER? If he works with the group your doctor is affiliated with, you would contact the medical director of that group as well as the ER medical director. I would do all this in writing, not over the phone. It is not hard to find out the names of the medical directors, just call the medical groups or the ER and ask who it is. Make sure you spell his name correctly, and put the correct letters after his name. I think what the HIPAA rules say is that you are entitled to a copy of your medical records, and if you feel something is untrue or misleading, you can put your own note into the chart stating what you feel to be the facts. You may not remove other people<APO>s notes. If you decide to do this, I would keep copies of everything at home, and about a month or two later send for your records again, and make sure they are including your note as part of the record. I would also write a letter to the state medical licensing board in your state and tell them a brief version of your story. If your daughter was present for all of this, I would have her sign it too as a witness. If you call them they will tell you what the reporting process is in your state. After you write all these letters, put them away for a week, then go back and re-read them, and edit if necessary. Then send them if you wish. He sounds like a jerk, unfortunately, there may not be much you can do about that. I would concentrate on doing whatever you can to get and stay well. Take care, Annette""That is one of the problems with our system of medicine. Folks without cash can end up in the ER instead of their doctor<APO>s office. The ER should not be the only place a person can go for medical care if they don<APO>t have cash up front. It is in many of our communities. Swank is correct, the ER is only prepared to rule out emergency findings in most adults, then they pass you on to your pcp or a specialist, and ignore the money problems involved with that. If your cervical infection goes away and all your other symptoms also go away, then I would put the onus on the OB/GYN consult that you had on one visit to the ER. PID and cervical infections are their area of expertise and he/she should have figured that out on examination. If the GYN did not do a thorough exam, I would talk to them. However, with PID, the pain is usually so evident on the external exam, that the pelvic is done mainly to gather cultures and specimens and to verify the infections. If the cervical infection goes away, and you still have abdominal pain you are back to square one. I will keep my fingers crossed for you. Take care, Annette""I disagree with that. If a patient comes in and wants scans and other testing, like some do, and it doesn<APO>t show anything, someone has to pay for them. Not all illnesses even show up the first time someone comes to the doctor. Their symptoms may be a bit vague or not textbook, and it might take time until their illness is diagnosable. What if the doctor gives the patient a diagnosis, but the patient does not agree with it? Who pays then? Until we change our system entirely, or change it legally, I think we are stuck with it. Just my opinion. Take care, Annette""I would wait and make sure the physical problem has been fixed. Then you will know more and be able to write a better letter. Write it carefully, and put it in a drawer for a few days, then take it out and read it again, edit it if necessary. Then mail it to whoever is the person who can fix the problem. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""I really feel for you, pancreatitis is a horrible disease, very painful and difficult to treat. I would not worry about your name being flagged anywhere. Do as the good doctor suggests and find a GI doctor skilled in dealing with pancreatitis, and a good pain management doctor. Of course, if you are in pain, vomiting non-stop, and becoming dehydrated you need to go to an ER. However, if you get yourself in a good pain management program, you should be able to work out a program where as long as you aren<APO>t vomiting you can manage your pain at home. Anytime you do need to go to the ER, make sure your GI doc is on staff there and is willing to come in and see you. I would personally pick one ER to go to, just so all my records are there, and the ER staff can get to know me personally. I totally understand the reasons you went to different ERs during this episode, but your health needs might be better met by just one ER taking care of you. Not all doctors are on staff at multiple facilities, it would be great if you found one, but I would not use that as my basis for choosing him. My doctor is not on staff at the local hospital as she moved her office to a nearby town and is on staff at that hospital. She and I have a plan should I ever need to be in the ER or an inpatient at the hospital near me. They have hospitalists on staff there, and my doctor would discuss my case with them, and they would take care of me. Hospitalists are fairly new in our area, they are on duty for set shifts and take care of the inpatients, so one is always in the hospital. In my experience all hospitals are different, and if you have more than one available to you, it might be a good idea to figure it all out ahead of time when you are feeling well, so you have a game plan for when you are ill. Take care, Annette""I have also had some pain in my hips, thighs and lower legs that feels deep like the toothache you mentioned. I have used Lidoderm patches, I cut them up and place them right over the painful areas. I didn<APO>t ever think they would work, but another member of this community mentioned using them and that they worked for her. My doctor gave me some samples to try, and they worked most of the time. Other folks have said they did nothing for them. 50/50 is worth a try if your doctor will give you samples. The brand name are very expensive, hence the cutting up of the patches. I think there are generic ones available now, Lidopain is the name I think. Ask your pharmacist. My hot tub is also a life saver. Take care, Annette""Every one describes pain differently. What one person considers to be painful, I may not, I may only think it is an annoying sensation. I have RLS and the discomfort ranges from the kind of tickling that you describe to a deep tooth ache type pain. I get the sensations in any part of my body, at any time of the day or night. Take care, Annette""Unless you have really good insurance, ask for samples first to try them out. That way you know if they work before you buy a bunch of them. They are very expensive. I think they are also may be available in generic now, Lidopain Patches, check with your pharmacist first, and make sure they are exactly the same thing. Best of luck to your wife. Take care, Annette""Hi, Charity I am so sorry you are going through all this for such a long time. It is very frustrating to go to doctor after doctor looking for an answer. Keep your chin up, they will find an answer. I used to live in Reno, NV, and flew down to San Francisco to a big hospital for a medical consultation with a specialist once. It was a hassle but it did show that my home town doctor was on the right track. Please post back again some time. I hope you find answers soon. Take care, Annette""Me, too. I think anyone can buy the books, but you have to figure out how to read them correctly if you have never used them before. It is so nice to read your posts here, very interesting. Take care, Annette""Hi, Beth I was so glad to read that you got an appt. next week. I hope all works out well for you. Take care, Annette""Best of luck with the new med. I have not heard of anyone using it yet, so be careful as always. I forgot, did the long acting morphine not work for you when you tried it some years ago? I am very apprehensive about new drugs. I use old generics whenever possible. I only try the newer drugs after they have been out for at least five years and well used by other people, lol. I want to really know the side effects prior to actually trying them myself. Let us know how you do on it. Take care, Annette""Hi, Beth It is pretty normal to change a person to 50% of the equianalgesic dose of a new med, then titrate it up to the proper dose. That is the safe way to change over from one opioid med to another. I don<APO>t really understand why some people are so likely to have withdrawal symptoms during a med change and others are not. I switched from MS to Methadone last year, and insisted on starting the methadone at a very low dose. My own fears and old experience using methadone in an addiction setting on patients, my doctor was more than willing to start me at a higher dose. I had no withdrawal, just worse pain. As I titrated the methadone up, the pain was better relieved. Methadone is so long acting with such a long half life that one can miss a dose completely and only have increased pain, not withdrawal. I know this from personal and professional experience with patients. I am not familiar with Exalgo, I wonder why if the MSC worked for you in the past, and you have been off of it for awhile while using other meds, why you just didn<APO>t go back to it? It is an old, well tested med, it has been prescribed for a long while on lots of patients, it is fairly cheap since it is available in generic, why change to a very new med that has only just been approved? I won<APO>t be the guinea pig for new drugs, just a personal thing. I think as long as a doctor selects his patient correctly, and does his documentation carefully, the DEA will leave him alone and go after the bad doctors. I hope you are feeling better. Take care, Annette""Clonidine is an excellent drug for withdrawal from opiates. It has been used for years and I haven<APO>t read anything bad about it. Klonopin is a benzo however. Klonopin has a really long half life, it is 19-50 hours, so the drug can build up in your system if you take it daily, and you can end up kind of overdosed. I have really mixed feelings about benzos. I won<APO>t take them as I had a bad experience with klonopin. I was taking only one mg. per day, at night, and when I went off of it, I went through terrible withdrawals that had to be treated medically. For me, it is a bad drug, and I have seen others go through the same thing. I went to a pain management class for relicensing for nurses, pharmacists and doctors in 2009 and the instructor told us that recent medical studies that had not yet been published showed that it was a bad idea to prescribe opiates and benzos to the same patient, and she thought that in the near future it would become a major no/no. It would be a matter of one or the other, but not both in the same patient. She said the studies were showing too much of an interaction between the two types of drugs. Just be aware, let a family member know that you are changing meds, and to keep an eye on you for any bad symptoms. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Methadone is a synthetic drug. It was invented during WWII by the Germans when they could no longer access morphine. Everyone responds differently to meds of any kind. I would not exclude a drug without even trying it, if it might help me. I know that you are not suggesting that. Methadone causes no real ill effects in me. Granted, I take a relatively low dose, but take things one step at a time. All opiates do cause constipation, but mine is less now than when I was on something else long acting. Talk to your doctor and see what is available. Take care, Annette""It is always nice to have different opinions here. I think the other readers learn a lot from reading the different threads, even if they do not post. Sweating, like nausea is a possible side effect from methadone, and other opioids also. The thing is that no one knows who is going to have a side effect and who is not. I also use this drug, and have not found this to be as big a problem as you have. I sweat in hot weather, but really don<APO>t know if it is from the drug or not. I hate it too. I think the same thing happened when I first started on long acting morphine many years ago. Then I thought perhaps it could be from menopause. Whatever it was, it went away after awhile. There was a recent thread on sweating on the Fibromyalgia Support Board recently, including comments by the resident expert, Dr. Mark Pellegrino. You might consider reading there to see how you might handle this. I just filled my RX and checked on the pharmacy information sheet I got with it, and it was written there about sweating. I never read this sheet before, I doubt I would take any medicines at all if I had. They are pretty scary to read about. I prefer my nursing handbook as it gives the % of users that get specific side effects when the info is available. It is far less scary that way, lol. I would suggest that you discuss this with your doctor, and then decide if you want to try a different medicine. No one should be a shut in. Take care, Annette""I DO know what you mean. I went through the same sort of thing many years ago. Fortunately for me, it passed and I got back to ""normal"". Take care, Annette""I guess I don<APO>t understand, I got that you have discovered that pot works for you, and is legal for medical use where you live, and you want off of the morphine??? In my state one is allowed to ""grow their own"" if they have a marijuana card. To get one you have to have a doctor recommend pot for you for health reasons, and pay a yearly fee. I do not know what the rules are in your state. I do know that where I live almost all of the patients get their letters from one of 2-3 doctors, that is basically all they do. I asked my doctors years ago what they thought of pot as a pain killer, and they all said use anything in moderation. I did not ask any of them for a letter to get a card though. I don<APO>t think any of them would have given me one. Back to your problem...if you want off of the morphine, tell your doctor that you would like to try to taper off and see how you do. You are already in ""constant and terrible pain"", even though you are using the pot your friend gave you, so I am not sure that pot is really the answer for your pain issues. I don<APO>t really believe that if you are at the upper limit of the dose for morphine for your pain and it is not working, that the pot will adequately substitute for it. But, give it a try, even if you end up at a lower morphine dose and have fewer side effects, it might be a good trade off for you. Another option is to ask your doctor to prescribe you Marinol (synthetic THC) and see if those pills help you at all. This is a legal medication often used for nausea from chemo. I have read here that some patients take this for pain. My husband has tapered off of opiates several times in his life with cancer and a hip replacement (all legal meds) and as long as he did a proper taper he had no withdrawals at all. I used to work with opiate addicts and they described withdrawal after abrupt discontinuation of their drugs as a bad case of the flu that lasts for 4-5 days, followed by insomnia for a couple of weeks. I think you may need to worry more about increased pain than withdrawal. I don<APO>t know what your doctor<APO>s ethnic background has to do with this issue. If you feel he is not the doctor for you, check around and see if another doctor who thinks more like you is willing to take you on as a patient. Ask other folks who do get their pot legally under the NM system what doctors they use. You have some serious decisions to make. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""You need to discuss these things with your neurologist. Often times people have tests within normal limits, but they misunderstand the doctors when they say the tests are all negative. They think that means the doctors don<APO>t know what is wrong or think they are not sick at all. Often times doctors have a list of possible diagnoses that fit your symptoms, they then do tests to see what is going on. As they get results back, they cross things off of that list. Often times whatever is left on the is what they think you have. There may not be a specific test for the diagnosis they decide is the most likely to be correct. I am not familiar with the most recent tests for RSD, but I am sure that someone with RSD will answer, if not write again and put RSD in your heading to get their attention. The last time I read about RSD they said that the sooner one started treatment, the more positive the results were likely to be. This can be difficult to treat so I would be aggressive if I were you. Take care, Annette""I also have FMS, that is the main cause of the pain that I use the Lidoderm patches for. It sounds like you and I have similar burning pain on our legs, don<APO>t you just hate it? I tape the edges of the patches with paper medical tape when I wear them to bed. I can<APO>t sleep with socks on, I need to be able to wiggle my toes, lol. I have been taking vit. D for over six months, my vit D level was in the low normal range when my doctor checked it, she suggested taking 2,000 units of Vit D. I take it but it doesn<APO>t seem to make any difference with my pain levels, I figure it is probably good for me anyway. I am with you, just keep trying whatever, and hope something works. Take care, Annette""I bet your doctor discovered the bone spur on some kind of scan, maybe the MRI? Arthritis can also be diagnosed from an MRI. I don<APO>t understand what you mean by ""nothing was found"", I have never seen MRI reports that said nothing was found, they always come up with some possibilities. Often doctors say nothing was found when they mean nothing that can be fixed was found, or there is nothing to do surgery on. I would not bother with therapy if you have really done the program three times and got no results, speak up and tell him that, ask him what he is ordering that is different this time. Then you think about it and decide for yourself. I would personally see a neurologist about the numbness and pain you are currently having. Take care, Anentte""My MRI showed the arthritis and bone spurs in my cervical spine. I have read many times that the MRI results are rarely consistent with the complaint of pain by the patient. Folks with bad discs may have no pain at all, and folks with normal discs can have terrible pain. Not being able to sleep is the worst, isn<APO>t it? It makes it that much more difficult to cope with the pain day to day, at least it does for me. I have found that once my body adjusts to pain meds, my brain returns to normal and I am able to do all my usual activities. Make sure when you make an appt. for pain management that the doctor does long term oral meds as well as interventional medicine. If all they do is give injections and they don<APO>t work, you are stuck again. Take care, Annette""I tried the Lidoderm patches for pain after someone else who posted here said they worked well for her. I cut them up and put them wherever it hurts, mainly on my hips and legs. They really help me. Nothing takes away the pain completely, but they do reduce the level of pain for me. Take care, Annette""I would continue to work with your doctors, but decline surgery unless you know all the specifics about it. You might try working with a pain management doctor who handles oral medication as well as the injections and procedures, see how that works out. Take care, Annette""I would do proper research on this treatment prior to even thinking about having it. Try just using the Google search engine or the search engine that you prefer, that will give you a starting out place. Find out if it has had randomized, double blind studies done to prove its effectiveness, and read those if it has had them. What does your own doctor say? I don<APO>t have RSD, MS, or Parkinson<APO>s so I can<APO>t tell you much. Take care, Annette""I followed links on Google and found an article from Washington state worker<APO>s comp that explained what studies had been done, etc. I found that the Dynatron work<APO>s in a similar fashion as a TENS unit, and I found little real evidence based research that showed this device actually worked any better. The Washington article quoted a $4-5,00 price tag and said they are not available for rent. I don<APO>t understand why someone would not be able to rent a device for short term use to see how well it worked. The inventor of this device is a podiatrist, and he said on his website that other doctors could not replicate his outcomes, he also said he already had a new device in a prototype called the VECTTOR, not yet approved by the FDA. He was talking about treating kids with DMD although he also mentioned RSD. Take care, Annette""Don<APO>t take any more than the amount that it says to take on the bottle and at the frequencies it says. He should not take it for longer than three weeks without a doctor checking him out. His discharge paper from the ER should have the name of a doctor for followup, if it doesn<APO>t, call the ER and ask who he should see for followup. Read the whole discharge instruction sheet(s), it may provide more information than he recalls, most people are too traumatized to remember what they were told in the ER, and then they don<APO>t ever bother to read the discharge instructions. Take care, Annette""If you have been having negative tests for over a year, every single month, I would call the testing company and explain it to them, ask them what could cause false negatives. As far as convincing the doctor, offer to take the medicine in front of him and sit around and be tested the same day in the office. If the test still comes up negative, he will call the testing company and they will work it out. Most tests are supposed to be sensitive enough to screen for one pill taken up to 72 hours prior to giving the specimen. Take care, Annette""I would find a pain management doctor now that offers daily oral medications as well as interventions like epidurals. I would do this before you get back on pain pills on a daily basis. Just tell your present doctor if he can<APO>t help you, can he refer you to someone who can. Or ask around amongst family and friends, or check with your pcp. Take care, Annette""I would keep after it with your pcp. It does not sound like kidney stones to me. I have never heard of kidney stones causing pain at a particular time of day. Take care, Annette""I have FMS along with a couple of other chronic pain conditions. I personally would not consider a pump. I avoid surgery at all costs. All surgery has risks, any doctor who tells you differently is telling fibs. Do all your usual research prior to getting one, and make certain your surgeon has put in lots of them, and that the doctor who will be in charge of refilling it, also has lots of experience. Don<APO>t consider asking on line for other opinions as research. Find out through evidence based studies how effective they are, and what the adverse effects are. Best of luck, come back and tell us what you decide to do. Take care, Annette""CFIDS is Chronic Fatigue Immune Deficiency Syndrome. The Zen Brothers are monks of the Zen Buddhist faith, I know because I asked the same question recently. Take care, Annette""Thanks, Caprice. I didn<APO>t come on line yesterday and missed this question. Hugs, Annette""Two percocet a day once your body gets used to them, should not cause any mental confusion. Chronic untreated pain might. I would write down worksheets of exactly what you need to do for your dad<APO>s treatments, step by step. Check off each step as you go along. Have someone else double check the worksheets before you print them out to make sure they are correct. Have one sheet per treatment. Your dad is lucky to have you. Take care, Annette""Best of luck to you. Just keep trying different things until you find the drug combo that works for you to control your pain. I tried all the other meds available, and then found that opiods did help with my pain, along with other treatments, drug and non-drug. But I feel meds are a minor part of my overall treatment program for my fibro. A great book for dealing with chronic pain is ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"" by Dr. Margaret A. Caudill, MD, PhD. It even has worksheets you can pull out and copy to keep track of your progress while you figure things out for yourself. Have you visited the Fibromyalgia Support Board here at WebMD? There are alot of good folks there, and a lot of social posting, some actual medical info regarding FMS also. Dr. Pellegrino is the expert there, he is great and has Fibro himself. Take care, Annette""I have FMS, and DDD in my neck, and migraines. I manage my pain and sleep with oral meds, and cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. I adore my hot tub, it gets rid of all my pain, even if it is only for a little while. I exercise for an hour to an hour and a half a day, but I worked up to that VERY slowly, over 2-3 months. I started at about 15 minutes a day, and added about 5 minutes/day once a week. I do not expect to be pain free, rather I do expect to be able to manage my pain at levels I can cope with. I hope you continue to come here, and keep in touch. Take care, Annette""Thanks for the kind words. Hugs, Annette""I am looking forward to hearing from you again. There are lots of us. Take care, Annette""I would also write in your journal, the dose and time of all your medicines, and score your pain about an hour after you take the tramadol. Sometimes doctors look at function more than complaints of pain. Give your doctor examples of goals you have set for yourself and ask him how to achieve those goals. Take care, Annette""I have read that if you fill an empty soda bottle half full of water and freeze it, then you can use it on the floor to roll your foot on, back and forth, that it really helps. It gives you ice and massage all together, and is very cheap. Take care, Annette""I agree about the politicians, they are all in it for status or money, Republican or Democrat. We have far too many lobbyists bending their ears for the drug companies. That said, I do agree with trying things that have been approved by the FDA, I would not try unapproved things either, nor will I use drugs until they have been widely prescribed for at least five years, so I can see what kind of side effect profile they have. They started a fast track for FDA drug approval at the start of the AIDS crisis to get life saving drugs approved quickly for folks who were dying already. Unfortunately, I think this has been abused by the drug companies for getting other drugs approved, and the FDA lets them do it. I think the FDA is become controlled by the big drug companies, not independent like it used to be. There are naturopaths who are trained in alternative medicine, you are free to try one of those if you wish to, but make sure he is properly educated and licensed. MDs are not trained in alternative medicine, I wouldn<APO>t ask one of them for advice about something they are not trained for. My husband<APO>s doctor went to naturopathic medical school first, then went on and became an MD, he is licensed in both and is the best of both worlds. I have not actually had much trouble finding a doctor to manage my pain meds personally, so I can<APO>t really answer to that. They sure don<APO>t seem to be afraid of the DEA in the three states where I have lived. I still don<APO>t understand why it matters where your doctor came from? Did he get his medical education here or there? He is licensed here, so he had to pass extesive tests. Take care, Annette""Anyhow, once a drug is approved by the FDA for anything, doctors can use it off label for whatever they want to, and in whatever dose they decide is proper. Curious. Take care, Annette""I am also looking forward to the doctor<APO>s comments. I have read that hyperalgesia is rare. With this, I believe that the increased opiate dose actually causes increased pain, rather than relief. I have heard that by keeping careful documentation of the times and amounts of ones opiate doses, and the times of onset of pain, etc. one can determine if this is a problem. Tolerance to opiate meds does happen, and the body will need a higher dose to get the same effect, but that is different from hyperalgesia. Also the pain one has may actually increase causing a need for increased opiates, but this is due to the worsening of the illness causing the pain, rather than the opiates themselves. Take care, Annette""Thank you, this is good to know. Please, if you come across anything showing long term negative side effects from using opiates let us know. Take care, Annette""Thanks for posting this link. I went and read the article, very interesting. Take care, Annette""You need to go see your doctor. No one on line can tell you what is wrong, you need a physical exam and a medical history at least, maybe an xray or other diagnostic imaging. Take care, Annette""Any new or different pain should be evaluated by your doctor. RLS usually does not cause severe pain, but we all perceive pain differently. Take care, Annette""Please, do this with your doctor<APO>s supervision if you decide to do it at all. My husband was on methadone for chronic hip pain when he had his hip surgically replaced, and they still managed his post op pain just fine. He got off of the methadone with a taper supervised by his doctor a couple of months after the surgery, once the cause of the hip pain was gone. He just explained to his surgeon just what meds he was already on for chronic pain, so they gave him his usual pain meds plus a bit more just after the surgery while he was in the hospital. Talk to your surgeon and your anesthesiologist prior to the surgery. Take care, Annette""Very well said. I totally agree with this poster. Write her doctor a letter explaining your concerns, but you are not even in the same state as she is, so I am not sure what you can realistically do. Take care, Annette""Make an appt. and go see a doctor in the same practice as your surgeon face to face. Doctors are not allowed by federal law to prescribe opiate pain meds to a person they have never seen before, on call doctors get a lot of phone calls for opiate refills for various reasons, they are often hesitant to just give them out. When he or another doctor in the practice sees you in person, and has your chart in front of him he may be much more amenable. If he does not want to give you Lortabs, ask him what else to try instead. There may be other treatments that work as well. Speak to your own surgeon when he gets back. Tell the person making appts. that you are having a problem related to your surgery and need an appt. ASAP. Ask for the appt. if someone cancels theirs if you feel it will get you in faster. Take care, Annette""I agree with you Beth. We all respond differently to different meds. But, I have been here for a long time, lol. Folks often write the same kind of thing for many meds, whatever they had a bad experience with they feel should never be used by anyone again. Or if something worked well for them, they think everyone should take it. We are lucky there are so many different kinds of drugs these days, if something doesn<APO>t work or causes adverse effects we can try something else. I think discussing things with ones doctor is always the best, they know the patient better than we do, of course. It is so nice having you as a member of this group. Take care, Annette""I have a treatment plan with my pcp. So I know what to do when my pain gets bad without using the ER. I have found this very reassuring and it makes me feel more in control. Take care, Annette""My PCP manages my chronic pain, I don<APO>t have an official PM doc. I do have a pain med contract with my PCP, she is the only one who writes RXs of any kind for me. She gives me both long acting opiates, and short acting opiates for breakthrough pain. She gives me a few extra BT meds every month just in case I have a flare. I also have non-opiate meds at home for use in a flare. She and I have discussed how I should use them. Of course, I would also call and make an appt. to go and see her in person. I use non-drug techniques to control pain also, my hot tub, exercise, etc. I have not needed to use the ER in about 12 years. Last Dec. I saw an official PM doctor. My state medical licensing board would like everyone who takes opiates for non-malignant pain to get a second opinion from another doctor who agrees that opiate treatment is needed. I had not had one in about ten years, so my doc asked me to get one. She also said that perhaps he would know of some new treatment available that she and I did not know about. He didn<APO>t though. He did make the comment that I was the best managed chronic pain patient he had ever seen. I was already doing everything he could suggest. I think everyone should have a plan for what to do in case their pain flares, and the things necessary to control their pain at home. You cannot plan for every contingency, but most chronic things can be managed at home with a little planning ahead of time. Hospitals are not a fun place to be when you are already feeling miserable. Take care, Annette""I assume by RH you mean rheumatoid arthritis? RA is the abbreviation that is usually used in medical circles. RA has lots of treatment options, I would see a rheumatologist for a positive diagnosis, then find out what your best options are. Be sure and write down all your symptoms and when they started if you can. The doctor needs a complete medical history to figure things out. A rheumatologiat is also qualified to diagnose and treat Fibromyalgia if you have that. It is another chronic pain condition with widespread pain. It is certainly possible to have more than one diagnosis at a time. Once you are diagnosed properly, the rheumatologist may let your pcp handle your day to day care, that depends on the rheumatologist. Take care, Annette""I would not worry so much about addiction. Addiction is a very rare side effect of using opiates. My nursing journal quoted less than 5% of the people who use opiates under their doctor<APO>s supervision become addicted. Charles, who also posts here, found a more recent medical study that quoted less than 1-2% of people using opiates under their doctor<APO>s supervision became addicted. Be aware, but don<APO>t be afraid to use drugs that may help your day to day living. Percocet works better if you take it at the onset of pain rather than as the last resort. The worse the pain gets, the more percocet you will need to get the same amount of relief. A medical study I saw way back when I was in nursing school (1968-1970) showed that people who put off using their opiates until their pain was intolerable, used more opiates than the folks who used them as soon as the pain started. I don<APO>t think you are supposed to take Advil and Aleve on the same day, they are both NSAIDs and I think you are supposed to take one or the other. There are other types of RX meds that can be taken every day to control pain, discuss this with your doctor. Sit down with your medical doctor and work out a plan for dealing with your pain. I would never let a chiroprator touch my neck, I have DDD and have had one discectomy. My husband<APO>s chiro, an older man, told me to never let a chiroprator touch my neck there was too much going on in there to have an adjustment without doing more damage. A nurse friend of mine stroked out on the chiroprator<APO>s table during a cervical adjustment, she went to the hospital via ambulance from the office. She lost the use of the right side of her body, it took three years to regain it enough to go back to work. I have read that the cervical adjustments can tear a vertebral artery that can bleed up into the skull. If I were you I would see a neurologist and ask him all the questions you have. If he cannot do anything after seeing you in person, then he will at least tell you where you stand and where to go from here. Take care, Annette""I am also very lucky in my medical care, I have had wonderful doctors. I am so happy that things are working out for you. I hope the meds continue to work well. Take care, Annette PS, I hope you don<APO>t stop visiting here now that your problem is fixed, but that is selfish of me.""I always recommend seeing a neurologist, they are not surgeons and would be able to tell you what your non-surgical options are. You can do this in addition to seeing a neurosurgeon. A neurosurgeon is still a surgeon, so he would be fine to tell you what your surgical options are, but may not be able to tell you what non-surgical options are available. I personally would not let a chiroprator adjust any part of my spine unless an MD saw me first and recommended it. Even then I would not let them do adjustments on any part of my cervical spine, upper or lower. Take care, Annette""Hi, Beth I am an old RN, not working due to disability, but still licensed though. I have worked in many different areas of nursing, including ICU, CCU, and the ER. I am also a chronic pain patient who reads a lot. Take care, Annette""Up here in Oregon you have to keep working to keep your license. I went to the trouble/cost of taking classes and licensing in Calif. again, because there you can re-license by continuing education hours. That was where I was originally licensed. I just keep hoping someday they will find a treatment that will allow me to work again as a nurse, I agree, hope reigns eternal. Is your PM doctor increasing your pain meds, or just treating your withdrawal symptoms? I don<APO>t really understand his reasoning, unless he just wants to decrease your tolerance level? Take care, Annette""I am not the doctor, but from a patient point of view, I would go fromt he least invasive to the more invasive. So, I would start with something like neurontin, work up through the different medicines, including opiates. If nothing else works at all, I might consider the SCS, but my understanding of the SCS is that the more spinal surgery you have already had and the more scar tissue, the less well the SCS is likely to work. Take care, Annette""I have found that there are generally two kinds of pain management clinic. One does a lot of injections, epidurals, and other procedures. The other does all that and also does PT, OT, biofeedback, massage, acupuncture, and daily oral medicines of various types including opiates. If all you want are interventions, see the first kind, but if you want to try oral meds go to the second kind. ASK before you set up your first appointment what kinds of treatments they offer. You want to be on the same page as your doctor from day one if possible. Take care, Annette""Class 1 narcotics are those that have no medical use and are all illegal, things like heroin. Class 2 are things like morphine, oxycodone, methadone, etc. Not all kinds of pain respond to narcotics. I also have FMS, and the antidepressants did me no good either. I found neurontin, zolpidem, and opiates do work for me, although they do not get rid of my pain, they do make it bearable. I suggest if you haven<APO>t already, that you find one doctor to manage your FMS issues. I see my pcp, an internist. Some folks use rheumatologists, neurologists, pain management docs, etc. Stick with one doctor that you feel good with. Read and learn to manage your pain with things other than meds. I use my hot tub, exercise, etc. in addition to my meds. No one thing works, it is a combination of techniques. My favorite website is at http://www.myalgia.com . Take care, Annette""It would seem to me that you should get to the bottom of having abnormal blood tests prior to getting pregnant again. My lab manual says that 30,000 and above are normal values for platelets in adults. I am not sure what the problem was, some values change during pregnancy, but discuss this all with your current doctor and make sure everything is okay now. he is the best person to guide you. You should also be seen by an OB-GYN prior to becoming pregnant, he may also know what would be best for you as far as meds, and could do any necessary testing before you get pregnant. Take care, Annette""Different labs do their counts differently, so their normal ranges may be different. I would discuss this with your new OB-GYN before you get pregnant. It is always a good idea to have a pre-pregnancy appt. where you get checked out to make sure your body is prepared to carry a baby full term. You can get all your questions answered then. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""What did you take the augmentin for? Where was your infection? An elevated ESR does not necessarily mean you had an infection, it would be high even for an inflammation. You need to see your doctor, so he can evaluate what is going on and perhaps do some tests. No one knows at this point why you are having mild fever and pain, it could be due to something else entirely. I am a believer in the very conservative use of antibiotics, I would not take them unless I knew exactly what kind of infection I had. Take care, Annette""I agree with Geraldine. Joint stiffness, nodules or pain of the joints, etc. should be evaluated by an MD. I saw a rheumatologist recently for nodules on my fingers. I have also not heard of this being related to back surgery. Take care, Annette""I am so sorry for your loss. Once you get the autopsy results you might know more. It is very hard for anyone to guess from what info we get on line. Ask her doctor to sit down with you and discuss the autopsy findings. Take care, Annette""Considering your symptoms it sounds like your doctor is doing the right tests. Vicodin does not come in 1000 mg. doses. It is a combination drug with hydrocodone and acetaminophen in it, I suspect you are counting the mg. of acetaminophen. I would ask him for a referral to a specialist if your insurance requires one. Anyhow discuss with him what kind of specialist he suggests at this point. It kind of depends on what his physical exam shows. A GYN, a neurologist or a rheumatologist would all be possibilities. Take care, Annette""I do understand how it is supposed to be at hospitals, but it does not always turn out that way. Some of the very small rural hospitals where I have worked in the past did not have extensive pharmacies, one had a drug pantry, and a pharmacist on duty in the day time only. At night a nurse had the keys to the drug closet. I have known people who went into withdrawals the day after their surgery due to a lack of communication between doctors. As I said, it IS their job to take care of this, but I would rest better knowing I had my medicine accessible if necessary. With my husband<APO>s surgery, I had his meds in my purse, and he didn<APO>t need them, because the hospital did their job. Big city hospital, lol. That way, he rested comfortably, and so did I. Take care, Annette""Of course you need to talk to your own doctors about this. That said, my husband was on long-acting and short-acting pain meds for a couple of years prior to his ortho surgery, and he stayed on them. The surgeon continued them while he was in the hospital, and gave him additional short acting meds for post op pain. When he was discharged from the hospital, the nurse gave us a RX for more short acting meds, but we gave it back to her, as his pcp managed his pain meds before surgery, and said he would continue to do so after the surgery. He did as he said he would. I have never heard of requiring someone to taper off their pain meds prior to surgery, but I can only speak for my own experience. You are right, you need to call your surgeon, you have plenty of time to clear this all up before you get there. I would also have a friend or family member bring your regular meds to the hospital when you have your surgery, just in case they don<APO>t have them or some crazy thing happens. Don<APO>t bring them yourself, put someone else in charge of them that you trust. DO NOT take them without discussing it with your doctor and nurse. Take care, Annette""I totally agree that you should not have to bring your own meds with you, it is their job to manage your pain. I just don<APO>t entirely trust them to do it, lol. Too many scary stories that I have heard from other people. When my husband was in the hospital, they continued his methadone as he was on it at home. But I still took it with me that first day, just in case.Thankfully, he didn<APO>t need it. A new person here just got a RX for Exalgo, a new form of long acting dilaudid. She said the pharmacy had to order it and it would be in on Monday. I would not want that to happen after I had surgery with the hospital pharmacy. Luckily, most opiate pain meds are old and common so hospitals will have them on hand. I am happy to hear the knee replacement surgery is behind you. Take care, Annette""I am on Facebook, but it is also private. I only joined so my daughter-in-law and some close family friends and I could exchange photos and news. I appreciate your invitation but let<APO>s wait awhile and see how it is as we get to know each other. I have only exchanged emails once before with someone I met online here, and it turned out really badly. So, I generally just stay in touch on this board. Take care, Annette""Ouch!!! A broken pelvis hurts!!! But, it is only 7 weeks out, things will get better for you. Surgeons are not very good at managing pain beyond the post operative period, so be glad he is sending you to a PM doctor. No reason to assume you will be in pain forever at this point. I<APO>ve had chronic pain for well over ten years now, it is managable. I live a happy life. It does take some getting used to though. Keep in touch, let us know what the PM doctor suggests. Just remember that you do not have to do anything he says, you can think about it, and do your research, and then decide. Don<APO>t let anyone push you around. Take care, Annette""Keep up the research, but make sure they are solid medical sites. I know it can be very frustrating, but you will do fine. Let me know what is going on for you. Take care, Annette""Discuss this with your neurologist. My husband had a neuro-radiologist examine his MRIs after he had a subdural hematoma, so that is an option. But, I would think a regular neurologist could look at your films and examine you and give you the answers you are looking for. Take care, Annette""I would discuss this with the anesthesiologist who will be putting you out for the surgery. He is the one who is responsible for your well being during the surgery. I am sure he can explain all this to you. Take care, Annette""I agree with Swank on this one. I have been happily married for over 20 years now. Before and after chronic pain for me, and for my husband. I don<APO>t complain, and just get on with living life. I am lucky because my husband had some serious health problems in the past, and he is very understanding. Not every spouse is able to cope with these things. I don<APO>t believe in dwelling on bad stuff, it only makes it worse. There is no magic answer for this one. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t understand why all the choices on the poll are negative? I don<APO>t feel any of those things. I have a great doctor and the medical community here has been fine so far, and it has been about 12 years now. I live in Oregon, now, I didn<APO>t have any trouble in Nevada either. I think if the horrible choices you have were going to happen they would have already. Take care, Annette""I happen to agree with Swank. No one can make me feel anything, I choose what I feel. I know my own self worth, and no doctor or pharmacist can make me feel less of myself. Things may have happened to us that are beyond our control, but how we choose to respond to those things are well within our control. I haven<APO>t been around ""druggies and drug seeking addicts"" since I became ill with chronic pain. It is fairly well known that sicker people are more likely to respond to polls like this on the internet, folks who are doing well in their life are often too busy to hang around a message board, so polls are often skewed towards the more negative. I have never hung my head in shame while trying to get treatment for my pain, why should I? I don<APO>t run through a gauntlet every month, I see my doc every other month, fill my RXs once a month at a store chain pharmacy who treat me with respect. I have no family rejection or loneliness. I think some good therapy might help a lot of people learn to cope better. I also think a lot of people would have had family problems regardless of their health status. It isn<APO>t luck and it isn<APO>t necessarily easy, it is a choice. Take care, Annette""There is a difference between actual laws and rules that a particular medical practice may have for their group. Many medical practices have very strict rules about opiates far more strict than the federal or state laws. The doctors often say ""that is the law"" rather than explain who actually made the rules and why. My doctor left her group practice and opened a solo practice, the rules about opiates in the group practice was one of her problems. They were very strict and made no exceptions. I have read somewhere that the DEA rules can be interpreted in more than one way about how often a schedule II narcotic may be prescribed. Some doctors interpret it to be every 30 days, some every 90 days. Everywhere I have lived it has been every 30 days. Take care, Annette""I would check with the Texas State Medical Licensing Board and find out just what the law says and what you should do. Does this law have to do with how the state handles W/C cases, or the prescribing of opiates? When I moved to Oregon I called and asked the medical board and found out just what was true and what was not. They were very helpful and directed me appropriately. Take care, Annette""Ask your pharmacist or your doctor why the state is no longer covering it? I suspect that Swank is correct, there are lots of cheaper oral meds that should work as well for most people. If your doctor feels this is very important for you, perhaps there is an appeals process in your state so this drug would be covered. Ask your Medi-Cal worker if there is an appeals process for this. Take care, Annette""There is nothing over the counter with the strength or Lortab. She needs to follow up with the doctor who did her surgery or her urologist. Especially since she is diabetic. Take care, Annette""It is not withdrawal, you haven<APO>t been on it long enough to taken enough to have withdrawal if you stop. I think the symptoms you are having are unrelated to the percocet. You need to discuss this with your doctor. I do not understand how you are using your meds either, if one tablet didn<APO>t give you enough relief, you were to try taking two at a time every four hours. Why didn<APO>t you try what they told you to do? Percocet CAN be broken in half, it is the long acting type of oxycodone that should not be broken or crushed, it is called Oxycontin, it is different than percocet, which contains the same pain killer, oxycodone, which also has Tylenol in it. If you are continuing to have pain that requires treatment, then call your doctor make an appt., and discuss all this face to face. If you no longer need the pain medicine anyway, then call the doctor and tell his nurse your symptoms and ask if you need to be seen. If you have a fever, redness, swelling, or any drainage from the incision, you need to be checked for infection immediately. Take care, Annette""CTBeth is correct. Speak to the prescribing doctor and explain just how you feel. You may need to taper of more slowly, or there may be other non-opiate meds the doctor can give you to help you get through this experience. Take care, Annette""If the naproxen is helping your pain and the morphine is not, perhaps you need to forget about the opiate family of drugs and work on the NSAIDs or something else to manage the inflammation since that is what naproxen does, and that improves your pain levels. The VA doc should be able to help you work that out. Thank you for your military service. Take care, Annette""My suggestion is to find one doctor that you feel comfortable working with for your pcp and stick with him/her. Ditto with specialists. You seem to have been examined by everyone, eight that I could count. As far as I could tell only one doctor saw you more than one time. Often examinations like prostate exams are very subjective, and the difference between one exam and the next might be more important than one would think, so it is best done by the same person. Prostatitis can also be very difficult to get rid of completely. It is possible that you have that AND something else.... I have no idea what is wrong with you, but I would want one captain of the ship, so to speak, to decide what is going on and to keep order among the specialists. My internist is my pcp, and I don<APO>t take any RXs from any other doctors. They send their reports to her, then she and I sit down and decide what to do next. She writes all my RXs. Next time, hopefully there won<APO>t be one, I would suggest you not take any antibiotics without a culture being done FIRST, to determine just what you are treating. Once you have taken antibiotics it is a lot more difficult to decide what is going on with lab tests. Take care, Annette""In my area, near Portland, OR, the dental school (the only one in the state) does not have a cheap clinic for indigents, and when I volunteered at a free medical clinic we had no where to send poor people who needed a tooth fixed, only pulled. The county clinic here doesn<APO>t have a dental clinic, only medical. A couple of times a year they would have a big dental clinic for poor folks put on by Kaiser and local dentists. I totally agree that it is cheaper in the long run, just not always possible if money is a concern. A blood infection would be taken care of in the ER where they have to treat you regardless of financial issues. I hate to see anyone end up in the ER with sepsis due to a dental thing that could be taken care of easily at the start. Take care, Annette""This is one of my husband<APO>s old stand-bys for when he can<APO>t get in to see the dentist. The dental kit comes with small cotton pledgettes and tweezers, and tiny bottle of clove oil. He would just follow the instructions. He says it kills the pain temporarily until the dentist is available. It is not a substitution for dental care. Take care, Annette""Talk to your dentist of family doctor. NSAIDs like ibuprofen often work better for dental pain than opioids because they also decrease the inflammation present. A pharmacist may also be able to help you. Take care, Annette""That is easier said than done if you don<APO>t have dental insurance or lots of money. In many areas the choice is either no dental care at all, or the option of pulling the tooth but not fixing it if you are poor. But, I agree, fixing the tooth is the best option. Take care, Annette""I would be glad to learn there was nothing structurally wrong with my spine. The MRI news is good news. You have whiplash with muscle spasms and tension headaches, that IS your diagnosis. I don<APO>t have any answers for you as far as what meds you need or don<APO>t need. Treatment decisions are up to you and your doctor. It seems like it is time to stick with your pcp for this problem. You went to the specialists, they did advanced testing, and found no structural defects. You have seen your doctor, a neurologist and a pain management doctor. As I recall the PM doc didn<APO>t use oral meds for pain management, only injections. The only specialist I can think of that would be any use at all is a pain management doctor who also uses oral meds to control pain. Most people on this board won<APO>t settle for anything less than an MRI for any kind of back pain. I think they are overpriced and often unnecessary. You finally had one, and it didn<APO>t show anything. That does not mean you don<APO>t have pain. Whiplash can cause severe pain. Take care, Annette""I would get a second opinion from a neurosurgeon in a different practice. If they disagree, see a third one. Most insurance companies will pay for a second opinion for an elective surgery. Take care, Annette""If this was a one time event, I would not be as concerned as I would be if this were a common occurrence. We are all human and mistakes can be made even when we try to be perfect. I am all for you taking your notes with you to the appt. you have next week, I would take all your notes from different appts. not just the one in question. This will show him that you do take notes all the time, and are not just saying you do. Show him where you wrote down the new instructions she gave you. Please try not to be angry or tearful, just state the facts like you would for a blood pressure medicine or some other miscommunication. Best of luck to you, I am sure it will all work out. Take care, Annette""I would follow through with your appt. with the doctor and take the notes you keep of your appts. If she is made aware that you keep notes and stand up for yourself, perhaps she will be extra careful. Perhaps in the future, you should have the doctor/asst. initial your notes before you leave, that way you all know exactly what you are to do. I had one rheumatologist who wrote out instructions for all his patients at the end of every appt. The computer printed out two copies, one for the patient and one for the chart. Perhaps this took a bit longer for each appt. but I bet it saved time in the long run as people would not have to call and ask questions because they forgot or got confused about a med dose or schedule. It was also absolutely clear what the plan was so there would not be problems like you are having. Best of luck to you, I bet it will all work out and the two of you will get along fine in the future. Take care, Annette""There are egos out there, for sure. You also have to remember that a doctor could have several hundred patients at any one time. Their days get interrupted with phone calls all the time, I doubt half of them even remember exactly who they are talking too. Protect yourself, no one else will. Maybe if you are seeing several doctors, keeping a notebook of your appts. would be useful to you. You could date and time the appts. and put the name of the doctor you saw on the first line, along with his specialty. Take care, Annette""I am so glad this worked out well for you. I am off to go see my doc now. Take care, Annette""If the pill looks different to you, I would take it back to the pharmacy and ask the pharmacist to look at them. Get the answer straight from his mouth. There are lots of different generics these days for so many drugs, I couldn<APO>t identify it for you. Oxycodone is the generic name of the only drug in Oxycontin, it is simply the long acting formula. You are not taking the sheet, you are taking the pill, so if there is any question in your mind that it is the correct one, take it to the pharmacist and find out for certain. I always look at the pills when I pick them up at the pharmacy, so if there is any question I don<APO>t have to make another trip. Take care, Annette""I would share the results of using Aleve with your MD. Anti-inflammatories often take about three weeks to get maximum anti-inflammatory results. I took ibuprofen for several years for a neck prpblem with DDD and stenosis, it worked fine for that length of time as far as relieving pain. I finally had surgery for functional deficits and stopped taking the ibuprofen. I was under the care of a doctor the entire time. That doesn<APO>t mean it would be the right thing for you.There are other types of anti-inflammatory meds that you might try that are RX only. There are also non-drug treatments. I would not see a chiropractor for neck problems, adjustments to the neck, when you know you have some disease there already could be dangerous. Talk to your MD first. You may need to use a variety of treatments, as this will probably be a life long challenge. Take care, Annette Take care, Annette""Discuss this with your doctor, you may be doing permanent damage to your legs by masking the pain instead of resting and letting it heal. You are concerned about your health down the road regarding taking too much ibuprofen, I would be just as concerned with your health down the road with you playing on an injury. Do not substitute a trainer<APO>s opinion for medical care. I would not see the team doctor either, there seems to be a conflict of interest there. Would he give you the best advice for you, or the best advice to keep the team playing and winning? I would find a sport<APO>s medicine doctor or orthopedic surgeon of your very own. Take care, Annette""You need to discuss this with your doctor who prescribes your patches. There is no way for us to know if your base line problem is worse, or if it is all due to reducing your meds. It may be that 75 mcg/hr is the least amount of medicine that will control your pain. Perhaps changing meds for awhile will help also, but again, this is a discussion to have with your doctor. Take care, Annette""You might go over to the FMS Message Board here and read what Dr. Mark Pellegrino had to say about brain changes with FMS. He was asked recently if FMS would lead to senility or Alzheimer<APO>s because of decreases in brain matter. He said no, that the latest research did not show that. The conversations were not about IBS, just FMS. I read the article that you referenced and it did not discuss fibro fog at all. I feel that about 85% of ""fibro fog"" in me was due to the meds I took for FMS at the time. Once I quit taking all those pills, the fog cleared. I continue to take some medications, I don<APO>t know how much of the fog is due to them, and how much is due to being distracted because I am in pain most of the time. Many other illnesses have their own varieties of ""fog"" from what I have read, so I don<APO>t believe it is really ""fibro fog"". My mom was totally healthy and raising five kids, and I remember her being totally forgetful in her 40-50s. I suspect she was just a very busy woman. The whole fog issue is very interesting. I read one study many years ago that had women with FMS read and listen to lecture material, then take a test on the contents. They took slightly longer to complete the test than the healthy controls, but their test scores were the same. The test subjects all thought they did much worse than they actually did, when they filled out the questionaires at the end of the study. I found it very reassuring. I stopped worrying about it at that point. Thanks for the link, it was an interesting article. Take care, Annette""Hi, Bren It is a great site, I have been there before also. Please, always share any info you find with the rest of us. It is great to learn new stuff, and to have discussions about it. Take care, Annette""Hi, Caprice I have often found that after I write a post, that WebMD will reply that they are not available right now, and try again later. This is written at the bottom where it usually says your post has been received and will appear at the end of the thread, or something to that effect. I have found that when I ignore this and just go on, when I come back my post WAS received and has been put at the end of the thread as usual. Very bizarre, but if I stopped and kept ""trying again"", I would go crazy. I really don<APO>t know if they always get posted eventually as I don<APO>t always check, but I think they do. I use Firefox and I am logged in when this happens. Any word on when the mail digests will be back? Hugs, Annette""Thanks, Caprice. Hugs, Annette""Hi, Gail It is so good to hear from you. How are things going? I saw my doc today, and all in all, things are going well. I have been belly dancing to the DVDs & TV for four months now and I am up to 1-1 1/2 hours a day. Still not letting anyone watch, lol. I have to say the stretching in the warm up section is great, it really helps my aches and pains. That lasts about 10 minutes, then it is hard work. I find I am more active, but of course, that brings more pain. That was one of the things I wanted to discuss with my doctor, my breakthrough meds were just not working at all anymore. She changed them to something else, so we will see. I will get the RX filled tomorrow. Please let me know how you are doing since your surgery. I hope the recovery part is past and you are feeling better. Hugs, Annette""If having the surgery got rid of the worst pain, there is no reason to regret it at all. You would always have wondered if you had done it what would have happened. If selling your big house and moving into an apt. or condo would be better for you, then go for it. Houston is a beautiful city, I passed through there on the way to Mardi Gras many years ago, everyone was so friendly and nice. We downsized about 15 years ago after my son moved out. We sold the big house outside Reno and moved to Oregon, we have lived in one-two bedroom places since. We have been in our duplex now for about 12 years, and we love it. It has a little yard, room for my hot tub and our two little dogs to play. Going from a owner to a renter again was strange, but it has worked out fine. I won<APO>t even let my husband watch my dancing, I am sure not going to put it on the internet, lol. I am no where near good enough. Are you posting your paintings anywhere I can go see them? When I saw my doctor I told her I was doing so much more, but that it caused more pain, and I really didn<APO>t want to decrease my activity. She said, ""you shouldn<APO>t have to"" and changed my meds after we talked about what we had tried and how it had worked. She just changed my BT meds, we will see how they work. I am sure it will be fine. The SCS is something to try when oral meds have failed. As long as you have not had back surgery, I think they are worth trying. Get a couple of opinions from doctors who use them all the time, to make sure you are a good candidate, and the surgeon putting it in is the best. Houston should have lots of good choices. I totally understand the negativity sneaking into your life again and hiding from us until it passed. None of us like to share depression, but please know that I am willing to listen anytime, to anything. Hugs, Annette""Hi. Nice to ""meet"" you. I started bellydancing to a TV show called ""Shimmy"" on the Fitness Channel. I would record it on my DVR then do it whenever I felt like it during the day. I started at about 10-15 minutes a day and very slowly worked my way up to an hour or an hour and a half daily. I have added DVDs from several different teachers that I ordered on line. I do the warmup from one and the exercises from another, depending on what I feel like that day. I have my own layer of fat, but have been losing about 2-3 pounds a month for a long time now, a total of 39 pounds. I don<APO>t do it to lose weight or tone up specific areas of my body, I do it because I enjoy it. I always wanted to try it, and now I have. I am 59, so it is good to do new things. I don<APO>t throw medicines away or not fill RXs. My doctor and I talk about things and then we decide together what to try. I give all meds a good chance to work and for the side effects to go away. Most of the side effects will go away with time. When I saw my doctor I told her about the new exercise I was getting from bellydancing and that of course it increased my pain. I said either we could adjust my meds because the BT meds didn<APO>t work anymore, or I could be less active. She said ""no one should have to be less active to control pain"", and we changed my BT meds. I would rather hurt a bit more and be more active, than just lay around. I am on methadone for my long acting pain med, and I didn<APO>t want to increase it at this point in time, she agreed. I really appreciate the kind thoughts behind your post to me. It is so nice of you. Take care, Annette""Hi, Gail I am sorry you aren<APO>t feeling well. The changes in barometric pressure from the storms you are having can make any kind of chronic pain worse. When I lived in Reno and had migraines I went through a similar thing. I have never actually been in a tornado, but have gotten up the next day and driven to work and seen the destruction in the orchards. One house we lived in out in the country, I got up and the neighbor<APO>s pole barn was in my back pasture. Scary. I am loving the belly dancing, it does get rid of some of my pain through distraction. I really have to concentrate, my body isn<APO>t meant to move that way, lol. My husband and I built a small deck and a tool shed last weekend. I didn<APO>t think the two of us could do it, but we did. It was my 60th birthday, so it was cool that I got to do something new. I kind of had to force myself to belly dance that day because I hurt so much, but I still did it. I always enjoy it once I get started. My husband is still not watching, lol.He is good about it, he knows if the spare room door is closed that I am practicing. You take care of yourself. Maybe your new doctor can get your meds adjusted or suggest some other treatment that will help. Don<APO>t worry about me, write when you feel like it. Hugs, Annette""I have always said that first you try the non-invasive stuff like meds, then move up to invasive things. It may well be time for you to try the SCS. I know you have tried all kinds of meds already. Read up on it, do your homework. Read up on the doctors too, choose the best one for you. As far as the wheelchair goes, I would discuss this with a PT that you really like. A wheelchair is like having surgery to me, it is a last resort, but when/if you need one, it is a very freeing thing. It allows you to get out and about. The more you stay indoors, and secluded, the worse things get emotionally. If you KNOW that a wheelchair is the best option for you and use it correctly, go for it. I have known people with MS, who got to the point of opting for a wheelchair, and they did quite well once they got past that intitial hesitance. I totally trust you to make up your own mind about these things. You have been in this game a long time, and have learned as you went along, same as most of us. Just use your head to get all the information you need. Hugs, Annette""As I remember the article was about patients with IBS, as you quoted. Because many people with FMS have IBS does not necessarily mean that decreased gray matter in patients with IBS will transfer to patients with FMS. They would need to do the studies on folks with just FMS to show that. Dr. Pellegrino, over on the FMS Board (he is the FMS expert there), just answered a discussion and stated that there was no decrease in gray matter in folks with FMS. He said that this was based on recent studies. I don<APO>t recall if he stated exactly which ones they were. I agree that many people have ""fog"", I just think that many different causes are involved. ""Fog"" is mentioned by many people with many chronic illnesses, each claim it is their own fog. Good to hear from you. Take care, Annette""Yes, it is time to go see a doctor about this. Perhaps start with the one who is ordering the PT. Take care, Annette""Check with the lab that does the tests and ask them what would cause a false negative. Ask them how to handle this problem. Take care, Annette""This is something you would have to discuss with your doctor. We can<APO>t make a diagnosis or anything like that. The doctor would need to examine you and hear your history. Take care, Annette""Shingles can be a very painful thing and lead to long term pain after the blisters heal. Have you tried antidepressants? They have been of some use in treatment of post-Herpetic pain. Take care, Annette""My husband had AVN of the femoral head in one hip. A hip replacement was the answer for him, but he is much older than you are. His new hip will probably last as long as he does. You are young enough to have to face the possibility of having your hip prosthesis replaced at some point. AVN of a hip that you are walking on is INCREDIBLY painful. It is like walking on a broken hip. My husband walked on his for a couple of years, working as a big truck mechanic. He had another medical issue that had to be cleared up before he could have the surgery. The thing is the replacement is really the only other treatment option. Since you feel the pain management clinic you go to is a good one, how about asking for the doctor to get another opinion from one of his associates? Or get another opinion from another PM doctor in another practice? Methadone in high doses can have the effect of blocking the usefulness of other opiates, but only you know if that was the case for you. Did the morphine you used for breakthrough pain help you? You are on a high dose of opiates when you add it all up, only you and your doctor can decide if it is worthwhile or not. When are you planning to have the joints replaced? Take care, Annette""As long as you are being followed by your family doctor and he is checking you regularly, I would do whatever he suggests. I took 8oo mg. of ibuprofen three times a day for several years for neck problems without any difficulty, but we are all different. My doctor did a blood chemistry panel and a CBC 2-3 times per year. Take care, Annette""Did her doctor suggest she use the foam collar/neck brace? If not, I would discuss this with him. My doctors felt that wearing the foam collars reduce the muscle tone and end up making the neck muscles even weaker. Perhaps her doctor could get her to try physical therapy to strengthen her neck muscles? If her family doc can<APO>t help her, ask for a referral to a specialist. Take care, Annette""Do you have side effects from the pain killers that you do not like? If they help, why not take them more often and feel better? Take care, Annette""You are the only one to decide when is the right time to take your Endocet. I tend to think that you are more likely to make mistakes due to the pain than due to the meds, just my thought. It sounds like you are using them sensibly. Addiction only happens in 1-5% of the people who use opiates for pain, so it is a very low percentage. Having people in your family with addiction/abuse problems, it is wise to be a bit more careful, as you are doing. You are also correct that DDD is usually permanent. However, after a couple of years, the disc that is bothering you may stop bothering you. Unfortunately, another may start, lol. Take care, Annette""Hi, Bren Ouch!!! I would let your doctor know about this and let him take a look. I don<APO>t think it has anything to do with the injection through your buttock. Humira can reduce your resistance to infections, can<APO>t it? Did the pudendal block work? You are braver than I, I would not be the ""first"" for any doctor to do anything invasive to. No one should help anything drain, not a good idea. Although it is one we have all had at some point in our life. Take care, Annette""I am 99% sure it wasn<APO>t a product of the injection the doctor gave you, I would never say 100%, lol. A pain doc knows nothing about lady<APO>s genital areas. It could be a Bartholin gland infection or a simple abscess, please see your GP and have her take a look for you if there is anything there still bothering you. It would never be a waste of time to check out a possible infection for someone on Humira. If it is no longer bothering you and seems like just a scar there, have the GP check it out the next time you are in to see her for something else. Just to be sure. Remember the only bad question is the one you don<APO>t ask, you will not be wasting her time. Take care, Annette""If it only happens when you smoke, quit smoking and see if it still happens. Talk to your doctor about the whole thing. He may have some help for you to quit smoking if that is what you decide to do. I would not use any other nicotene products, like patches, etc., before seeing your doctor about this. Take care, Annette""I think you have already found the answer, just make appts. with him and avoid seeing her when possible. Ignore ""looks"" and just pretend everything is normal and you are asking for blood pressure meds. I have found that this encourages the doctor to act normal also. Take care, Annette""I hope you have a good day soon. My husband and I built a small deck and put up a tool shed last weekend on my 60th birthday!!! He is 66, a retired truck mechanic, and has a total hip replacement on one side. I have FMS, and hurt all over now, but it was way worth it. He can move his tools and tool box/work bench from storage to our own shed now. We both work through our pain and then plan on having recovery days to feel better. We never stop entirely, because then we will both seize up so to speak. It is great that you are still working, we are both at home now. I just couldn<APO>t do it anymore and went on SSDI. He is old enough to retire on SS. I can<APO>t take antidepressants, they don<APO>t help and actually made me feel worse. My husband took them as part of his pain management program and tapered off recently. We love our hot tub, it is just big enough for the two of us if we sit cozy. Stay positive if you can, I know it is hard, but it really is the best thing for you and your pain levels. Take care, Annette""Unless the doctor prescribed the foam neck collar/brace, she should talk to him before using it. My doctors both told me not to use one, because the muscles in the neck will lose tone and become weak within days. I really hate that the drug stores can sell them without a RX. I would ask for physical therapy, they can take a look and teach her some exercises to try. Seeing a neurologist might be useful if her family doc cannot seem to manage this. Take care, Annette""I have DDD in my neck with herniated and bulging discs. I am pretty sure that disc problems do not cause swelling in the elbow and lower arm. Ask one of your doctors for pain medicine of some kind while they are figuring this out. There is no reason for you to be in pain meanwhile. Take care, Annette""I would couch my request in the form of asking for better function, rather than less pain. Tell the doc what you would like to be able to do if your pain was under better control. It might be meds, it might be something else. Be willing to try whatever he suggests. Take care, Annette""I think this is a good idea too. Surgeons are not trained to manage pain after the initial post op period. Keeping your foot elevated HIGHER THAN YOUR HEART will also help. If you don<APO>t do that, no amount of pain medicine will help you. Most young people cheat on that one, either they put their foot up on the coffee table, or on a pillow while they sit up. It must be higher than your heart. The higher the better. This helps decrease the swelling and the pain. Take care, Annette""Thanks, Trent. What a nice thing to say. It is amazing how elevation to the proper level works, isn<APO>t it? Take care, Annette""There was a study many years ago that seemed to indicate that using dextromethorphan would decrease the amount of opiates one should have to use for chronic pain. I do not think subsequent studies showed the same thing. I would suggest you do a search and see if you can find multiple studies that show it affects how much opiates are needed. It is currently used mainly as a cough suppressant. Take care, Annette""Back when I had a lot of migraines, I found that good sex would relieve the headache. It was harder to get going due to the pain, but worth it in the long run. All you can do is have good communication with your partner, use the times and positions that work for you. Have lots of good touching and cuddling even if it does not lead to intercourse. Take care, Annette""I haven<APO>t seen demerol used for chronic pain for over 10 years. It is metabolized into very toxic substances. It can cause seizures and other symptoms of toxicity when used more than once in awhile. It wasn<APO>t even used much in the ER back when I was working, 10-12 years ago. There are a variety of long acting pain meds. Methadone and levorphanol are the cheapest. You don<APO>t really need to worry about addiction, it is very rare in pain patients, about 1-5% depending on what study you read. I am aware of it, but I don<APO>t worry about it. As long as you only take your meds for real physical pain and not to get high or to alter your mental status you should be fine. Take care, Annette""I should get commissions for that book, I loved it, and tell everyone to at least give it a read and see if any of it hits home. The author is Dr. Margaret A. Caudill, MD, PhD. The actual title of the book I am talking about is ""Managing Pain Before It Manages you"". We are probably talking about the same book. Take care, Annette""I think you just need to follow through and see this specialist along with your MRI and Xrays. Will your PCP give you some kind of pain reliever until you get a real diagnosis from the specialist? An antidepressant may also help, both with your depression and with the pain perception. Take care, Annette""Please let me know how this appt. goes. I hope all goes well. Take care, Annette""I am so glad to hear you have a plan of action, that is half the battle. It is great that your family doc will take over your pain management until the surgery is completed, one less thing for you to worry about. It sounds complicated, but the surgeon probably does it all the time. Be very careful to make certain that EVERYONE who comes in your hospital room or touches you in the office washes up before they lay their hands on you. You want to see them do that!!! I believe in soap and water when it is available. I am an old nurse, and I know we are all supposed to wash between patients but I also know it does not always happen. In this day and age of MRSA and other serious infections, no one should complain, and if they do, too bad, it is your health not theirs, lol. Infections seem to be the number 1 complication after surgery, so be careful about this if nothing else. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""I am glad to have been any help at all. I am so happy to hear that you came right out and told your surgeon how you felt about the excellent care you got from him and his staff. I am a letter writer, myself. I put all those good things in writing and mail it off to doctors and hospitals both. I name names when possible. That way when it becomes evaluation time, the folks who took such good care of you should hear about it. As a retired nurse, it always made me feel good to know that I impacted a patient<APO>s life in a positive manner. Some hospitals I worked at saved letters in your personnel file, others put them on a special bulletin board in the nurses<APO> lounge for all the nurses to see, it cheered up everyone. I hope you also have a nice Easter. Take care, Annette""Neurontin isn<APO>t new anymore. I have been on it for about ten years now. Have you tried Lyrica? It is similar to neurontin, newer and a bit different. Lidoderm patches may also help you. You can cut them up and apply them over the painful areas. Talk to your pain management doctor if you have one, if you don<APO>t, find one that uses many different modalities, not just injections and procedures. Take care, Annette""Best of luck to you. I know how hard it is to find a med combo that works for you. I went through it with migraines, years ago, and again with FMS. I have found it is best for me to stay away from all antidepressants as they only make me worse. Neurontin works well for me, but not for you. We all respond differently to all meds. I have also found if I take ambien/zolpidem so I sleep better at night, that I cope with chronic pain better in the day time. Take care, Annette""TDXSP08 is correct. Many meds are available in sublingual (under the tongue) formula and many other meds are given that way by some doctors. Absorption through the mucous membranes of the mouth and along the gums and cheek gets some meds into the patient as fast as IV meds without the needle stick. I do not believe that using meds this way would cause someone to ""lose track of a couple of days"". The drugs do come on fast, but they don<APO>t last long, so she would have to keep repeating the dose every four hours or so. It seems that she would stop using it, if she were having memory problems with it. But, I don<APO>t know her, or her situation. No one should be driving their car while using any opiates until one knows how they will respond to the meds, some folks may never be safe to drive on opiates. Everyone responds to meds differently. Take care, Annette""I am not aware that chewing these particular pills and letting the absorb through the mucous membranes of the mouth would make any difference in how they worked. I am also not aware of how they would be involved in a ""hyper-absorption"" situation if swallowed properly. I have never heard of this. Take care, Annette""I am really anti-injection for chronic pain. The complications of the injections over time makes them really iffy. The absorption rate varies as the muscle is used over and over again. You develop lumps and scar tissue, sometimes abscesses. If you are really concerned with the quickness of absorption, I would ask your doctor if he will let you try the fentanyl lollypops, or fentanyl lozenges that you put in your cheek next to your gums. They are absorbed quickly, probably more quickly than the injections are. Personally, I would rather stick to oral pills for pain, but that is my personal preferance. What else do you do for pain control besides medicines? Take care, Annette""No one can diagnose you on line, not even a real doctor. Please go see a real doctor in person. He will need to examine you and perhaps get some blood work to come to a real diagnosis. If money is a problem, look for a free/low cost clinic in your area. Take care, Annette""Talk to the prescribing doctor or your pcp. Either one should be able to help you titrate the pain meds so that your pain is minimized and you do not have withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms in this kind of situation would be unlikely, your symptoms could also be caused by something else, all the more reason to discuss this with your doctor. Take care, Annette""The doctor just changed him from Percocet 10 mg. (oxycodone with acetaminophen) to plain oxycodone at a higher dosage. I am glad to hear it is working better. I agree with Swank, as long as the meds are helping with his pain, I wouldn<APO>t worry about his liver if he already has liver cancer. Leave that up to the doctor. The tylenol hurts the liver more than the oxycodone anyway, so the doctor was looking out for him by changing it. Take care, Annette""I am so sorry to hear about your mom<APO>s diagnosis. I lost both my parents to lung cancer. If it has already spread to so many bones, she has had it for quite awhile. The problem with lung cancer is that it often goes undiagnosed for so long, it doesn<APO>t usually cause symptoms until it is advanced. The fact that your mom asks to be turned frequently might indicate that she really is in pain, if you hurt all the time, you cannot get comfortable and frequently change position. When cancer goes to the bones, it is very painful. Because of her short life expectancy, you don<APO>t have to really be concerned with her becoming tolerant to her meds, they can increase her dosage as needed. The patch may be fentanyl, a long acting opiate delivered through the patch and the patch is changed every 2-3 days on a set schedule. The morphine drops are fast acting and help her with extra pain that the patches do not cover, like pain from turning over. It is unusual for fentanyl patches to be given to someone who has not already been on daily opiates. There is now a very low dose available. Also older patients often will put up with pain and assume it is part of aging, but when the cancer diagnosis is given they often feel it is then okay to use opiates. Many people of that generation would avoid opiates if they were not terminal. You didn<APO>t say how she feels about the opiates she is taking now? Does she feel she needs them? When my mom was diagnosed with lung cancer, she was 69, her first question to her cancer doctor was to ask if she would medicate her pain, even if it would cause her to die earlier due to respiratory failure. Her doctor said yes, she would if that was what mom wanted. Mom, like most people, was terrified of being in pain, but understood she was dying anyway. Mom needed that reassurance that her pain would be taken care of. She could deal with dying, but not with horrible pain. She needs to be turned at least every two hours to prevent bedsores and other immobility problems. As long as you feel good about the nursing care she has gotten for the last 7 years, why don<APO>t you voice your concerns to the nursing staff and see what they say. I do believe in dropping in at unexpected hours to visit all people who live in nursing homes. The patient care is always better for patients who have frequent visitors. The squeaky wheel gets the oil. I do not know how the nursing staff does that kind of work, it is very hard, and they are overworked and underpaid. Good nursing staff in long term care facilities are angels sent from heaven. I would ask the oncologist if he feels your mom is overmedicated. You might also ask if there is hospice nursing available. Hospice nurses are used to dealing with pain near time of death and how best to manage it. Take care, Annette""By prescribing the oxycodone 15 mg. tablets, the doctor is able to remove the tylenol from the picture. Percocet contains oxycodone (the opiate pain med) and acetaminophen (generic for Tylenol). It has been shown that too much tylenol can harm the liver, so those of us who take these kinds of meds usually opt for the lowest dose of tylenol available or none at all. By using the 15 mg. oxycodone tablets the doctor does not have to have your dad take a bunch of tylenol along with the pain med that is helping him. Take care, Annette""Like Swank said, the Tylenol/acetaminophen is supposed to make the oxycodone work better. Tylenol/acetaminophen does not cause a problem with everyone<APO>s liver, it is one of those side effects that happens sometimes in some people. You would have to ask the doctor why he decided to change it at this point, there are lots of valid reasons to do so. The damage caused by liver cancer is different than the damage caused by Tylenol/acetaminophen. I assume the doctor does chem panels on your dad<APO>s blood regularly, perhaps they have reached a point where it matters that he is taking Tylenol/acetaminophen. Perhaps, his pain has reached the point where the extra 5 mg. of oxycodone is more important than adding a small amount of Tylenol/acetaminophen to the mix. Tolerance is different in everyone. It is very difficult to tell the difference between tolerance requiring a higher opiate dose and the worsening of the basic disease process causing more pain. ALL opiates can cause tolerance, but it usually does not happen all that quickly. I have gone years between dose changes for my opiates for my chronic pain. Other people increase their doses more frequently. I don<APO>t believe it matters anyway. Increasing pain for whatever reason is just an indication to evaluate the dose of all the pain meds, and adjust things accordingly. The main side effect of all opiates (and many other meds) is constipation. This is the one side effect that does not go away with time. Ask the doctor or his nurse for a bowel care program to prevent this from happening if it hasn<APO>t already. It is far easier to prevent constipation, than it is to ease it once it starts. I know this may be an embarrassing topic to bring up, but we have heard it all before, so no worries. I am happy to try and explain things in general as best as I can, but your dad<APO>s doctor is the best person to explain these things, since he knows your dad and his medical history far better than I do. He is the one making the suggestions about the meds, so he is the one who can best explain those suggestions accurately. I would suggest you sit down with your dad a few days prior to his medical appts. and prepare a list of questions that you both want to take with you. You may have valid questions that he did not think of, and vice versa. When my mom had cancer, I went to all her doctor appts. with her, and this was our approach. I was the note taker, and made sure we got answers to all the questions, and I wrote them down in the office as we went along. Later, she and I discussed them. If we came up with more questions we wrote them down for the next appt. Of course, anything really important would merit a phone call right away, but I feel face to face meetings are better. Take good care of yourself too, or you won<APO>t be of any use to your dad. Hugs, Annette""You didn<APO>t mention how well the morphine is working? I have only changed my meds twice in the last year, both times because I asked to change. Once was because I changed insurance to Medicare, and wanted a cheaper long acting med, and the other time because my BT meds stopped working. Before that I probably went 10 months on the same meds. Sometimes I have gone years without changing my meds, so my doctor appts. are very brief at times. If your brother<APO>s pain is not well controlled (not eliminated, just controlled) with the meds he is on, then he needs to tell the doctor what is going on, if the doctor doesn<APO>t listen, then I believe it may be time to get a new doctor. But, if the meds are working, then don<APO>t worry about it. Take care, Annette""Oxymorphone is not a combination of oxycodone and morphine. It is a different drug in the opiate family. I am glad you are getting relief from it. Take care, Annette""I used a generic of MS Contin for over ten years and had great relief from it. I only changed to get cheaper meds. Everyone is different, and responds differently to meds. All meds are not the same in dosage either so I am not sure that one should compare 30 mg. of one opiate to 30 mg. of another opiate. Let your doctor know about the problems you are having so he can adjust things for you. Take care, Annette""Doses for dilaudid would vary from person to person, especially since you are on fentanyl patches already.You would need to discuss this with your doctor, and you might have to try them, and then titrate them according to your pain levels. How is the prolotherapy going? Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know offhand what dose of dilaudid would be appropriate for you. I am afraid that by the time you figure out the right dose, your therapy will be over with. How many treatments are usually required? How far apart are they done? One problem with prolotherapy that I have read about is the serious pain caused by the treatments themselves. I hope you feel better soon. Take care, Annette""My main comment is to correct what I suspect was more of a typo than anything else. ""hepatic impairment"" is decreased liver function, not kidney function. Decreased kidney function might be referred to as renal impairment. The dosing difference from one opiate to the next really is not an important issue,as long as the doctor works with the patient and addresses the patient<APO>s need for pain relief. I don<APO>t believe there are any good medical studies that show any one opioid works better than another or has fewer side effects when used for chronic pain. What works for one person may not work as well for another. I think one should be open to trying them all and see how it goes. Work with your doctor. Take care, Annette""I hope your husband notified his doctor that he was having these symptoms. The doctor can adjust his medication according to his symptoms and he should be fine if it is the new oxycontin that is bothering his. It is good to call Purdue, but also follow up with your regular doctor. I doubt these new pills will go away, so I think it is best to figure out how to work with them. Perhaps Purdue will work on making them feel the same to patients as the old pills. Did Purdue give you links to any double blind studies with the old Oxycontin and the new Oxycontin, comparing the two? Take care, Annette""Since it sounds like the new pills offer less active ingredients than the old pills from people<APO>s accounts of possible withdrawal symptoms and the return of their pain, I doubt that anyone would die of that??? An overdose might cause death, but not an underdose? I have not read anything about the pills being coated in plastic. I read that the drug company added something to the pills to cause them to gel up if someone tried to dissolve them to inject them IV. Take care, Annette""Beth, et al, I am a bit cynical. The makers of Oxycontin have been discussing this for many years. Other drugs are and have been available in tamper proof forms, or with additives to prevent abuse. At least one that I am aware of was available prior to Oxycontin ever being made. I cynically suspect that the makers of Oxycontin waited carefully until their patents on Oxycontin were just about up or just elapsed and then offered this new formulation so they could apply for a new patent and get many more years of exclusive rights. Just my opinion, lol. I do agree though, that regardless of motivation, a tamper proof formula is a good and safe way to manufacture drugs of abuse. BrenBren, I don<APO>t know that it will make any difference in its ability to control pain, that is not the point, the point is to prevent abuse. One of course, hopes it works at the same level at least. Swank, The good doctors do know their patients well enough to prescribe what they need. However, many doctors get their drug info on new drugs from sales reps because they don<APO>t have time to do all the research they should, these doctors often prescribe based on what the sales reps say, either due to laziness or naivete. This is why we all have to do our own research on drugs, especially new ones. Take care everyone, Annette""I<APO>m sorry, we can adjust our medications to work for us, or change to another med for our pain. Addicts don<APO>t need yet another drug to abuse. I would hope that all the makers of long acting opiates would make their drugs tamper-proof also. There is just too much medication per pill to be safe to inject all at once. Addicts are not functioning with a clear and able mind. I feel sorrier for addicts than I do for chronic pain patients. We have lots of choices for pain treatment that work for many of us. There are few treatments for addiction that work at all, let alone for many. I suspect many more people die of addiction related causes than complications from chronic pain. I wish there were treatment facilities available for all addicts who wished to get clean, and for all chronic pain patients too. Why does it have to be for one or the other? Take care, Annette""I think that Purdue has just stopped making the old Oxycontin and are making a new tamper resistant version of the same drug. The old Oxycontin will not be available once the drug already being sold by retail pharmacies is gone, if I understand things correctly. Sometimes I am confused by all that is said here, I would ask your pharmacist this same question, he is probably more up to date on this that we are. They are doing it because in many parts of the US people who have addiction problems are abusing the old Oxycontin by dissolving and injecting the tablets, or chewing the tablets up to get all the drug into the body quickly. Oxycontin is not even prescribed in some parts of the country due to this according to people that have posted here who ran into that problem. Again discuss this with your pharmacist. I think they have the most up to date info and certainly hear about complaints from their customers quickly, even the ones who do not call the drug companies. Take care, Annette""Whenever you change from one long acting opiate drug to another, you should expect to have to adjust the dosage afterwards. It is not necessarily a straight forward mg. for mg. changeover. Let your doctor know how you are doing so he can do this for you. That is what he is there for. Take care, Annette""How long have you been on the Opana? Just curious, as the side effects do usually pass. Take care, Annette""I would consider adjusting the dose of the Opana myself. I also would not wait three weeks if they didn<APO>t work, I would not wait more than a couple of days, then ask the doctor to adjust it again if necessary. It is very common to change the dose of a new opiate when switching from one to another, often several times. I would adjust them until you are getting the same general, overall pain relief that you were getting before. Unless the Opana dose is very high, I wouldn<APO>t go for the BT meds first. Just my opinion, discuss it with your doctor. Take care, Annette""I am confused, after ""2.45"" what? Take care, Annette""Anyone can file a complaint with the FDA or with the drug company itself, you don<APO>t have to be a doctor. I am not sure what you mean when you say the drug company has them all paid off. The drug company was very resistant to even changing the drug years ago when states complained about Oxycontin being abused, I suspect they put it off until their patent was about to expire anyway. This way they get to start their patent time over again. It is easy enough and far cheaper to simply use a different opiate. I have never even used Oxycontin, I prefer cheaper, generic drugs. I have always used a generic, it has been over 15 years for me. Take care, Annette Take care, Annette""He is not doomed to a life of pain. He can talk to his doctor and adjust the dose or change meds if he wants to. Don<APO>t give up, just move on. Take care, Annette""There are other cheaper long acting opioids available. Generic MS Contin, methadone, etc. Take care, Annette""I would discuss this with your doctor just as you did here. Let him know how things are going. It may be the meds or it may be that your pain is just worse and coincidentally happened at the same time you changed meds. Who knows, the important thing is that you need better pain control. You were lucky that you were pain free for awhile, most of us never reach that state once we develop chronic pain. Take care, Annette""I<APO>ve never been addicted to drugs. No family members are addicts that I know of, though some are alcoholics. I believe it is pretty much the same thing. I worked in a heroin addiction treatment center many years ago. I have seen patients and friends go down the path of substance abuse. I don<APO>t believe that comparing my pain to yours or anyone elses is a useful occupation. Many people that I was involved with professionally who were addicts were self-medicating emotional problems, we called them ""Dual Diagnoses"". I think we can just agree to disagree. I have known many heroin addicts, and they are not getting high after the first couple of months, they are usually just using enough of their drug of choice to avoid withdrawal. It is a terrible life, no one would choose it any more than anyone would choose to have chronic pain. I believe it will be shown in the future that substance abuse is a genetic flaw. They have already shown alcoholism has a genetic side. I would personally still rather have chronic pain. I still believe we have many more treatment options that work to make us comfortable than substance abusers have. Just my opinion, we all have one. Take care, Annette""So change to a different long acting pain med. I use methadone because it is very cheap and keeps me out of the donut hole in my Medicare Part D insurance. I use generic oxycodone IR for breakthrough pain, it is okay, but not the holy grail. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t have an answer for you. 60 mg. three times a day is a large dose. I bet there is a larger story to the doctors DEA problems, but it really doesn<APO>t matter. A doctor can prescribe anything or not. Have you tried levorphanol? Take care, Annette""Well said. Addiction is just another medical problem and it can affect anyone. Take care, Annette""Call a suicide hotline for help with this, or speak to your pcp and get a referral to a therapist. This is not the place. No one on line can really help you with suicidal thoughts or feelings. Take care, Annette""Grapefruit is know to interfere with many medications. If I were a grapefruit afficionado and were taking a variety of medications, this would worry me. I don<APO>t eat or drink it that often though, so I don<APO>t worry about it. I have been aware of that for some years though. I am 60 years old and have only taken two of the drugs in that list, so though I feel it is good to be aware of these things, I won<APO>t worry about them. If one has AIDS or high blood pressure for instance, and is on a number of those drugs, AND one sees an effect with how their oxycodone works, one should be far more concerned. I think this is an article to file away for future reference for those of us who use opiates regularly. Thank you for bringing it to us. Take care, Annette""Not all neurologists are migraine specialists. It sounds like he has done all he knows how to do. I would go see a headache specialist. Narcotics like vicodin are bad choices for headaches, unless you only get one once in awhile. Taking them daily can cause rebound headaches, or chronic daily headaches. You say they aren<APO>t working anymore anyway. I started having migraines at about 35 years of age, but some people start getting them as children. Once you have taken all the different kinds of preventatives, then you start over taking them two at a time, and do all the combinations. I had to have prednisone once to break the migraine cycle, it worked. I still had migraines, but not daily ones. Take care, Annette""Your doctor should tell you all you feel you need to know about this procedure. It is far better you get your info from him than on line. He may even have patients who have had this done, who can give you their perspective. Take care, Annette""They want you to use a long acting opiate instead of short acting ones 24/7. This is supported by all the latest medical research. You have a fairly long list of options. I would give them a try. The dose of various meds is different depending on how strong it is, so if you take hydrocodone you take 20 mg. at a time, a different drug will be a different dosage. It may be stronger mg. for mg. but you will be taking less of it. No one is forcing you to do anything. You always have a choice. If you don<APO>t like this doctor<APO>s way of doing things, change doctors. But, I think he is doing things correctly according to medical standards. No one likes change, calm down and think it all through. Take care, Annette""Addiction IS a medical problem, so I guess we just disagree. Take care, Annette""I went to my doctor last year when I went on Medicare and asked for methadone as it is by far the cheapest of all the long acting opioids. She didn<APO>t mind putting me on it, I started very low and increased very little. Many years ago, in the 1970s, I was a nurse in a heroin treatment facility where we used methadone in treating addicts. To me, Suboxone is pretty much the same thing. It is a substitution therapy and probably works for some patients. I would just go to your doctor and tell him you can no longer afford the $400 a month and need to switch to something cheaper like methadone or levorphanol. That is another old, cheap drug. Ditto what you said about the drug companies, lol. Take care, Annette""Everyone who ends up addicted to heroin has their own story, they are not all bad people. Working in the addiction treatment facility was my first job out of nursing school. I helped start the place, and met lots of interesting people. You misunderstood the clean urine, w/d symptoms thing. They want to see you are clean via the urine test, and having withdrawal symptoms that can be documented by someone looking at you. So, it is get clean, stay clean, get in the program. But, if you are clean as far as heroin goes, and already have been in therapy long enough to know why you were using, and you are correct about using for untreated pain, I don<APO>t see the point of more addiction treatment. One should never date their therapist, it usually ends up badly for everyone. Her mistake, she should have known better. You should be able to get worker<APO>s comp for the injury to your back when the ladder slipped? Your boss will hate it, but oh well...You should be able to, it might get your foot in the door for some kind of treatment. I volunteered at a free clinic and we had the forms available there so work injuries could be documented. Nice talking to you. Take care, Annette""What kind of crazy rule is it that someone who has an allergic reaction to one drug cannot go back to their old drug? That makes no sense at all. I must have misunderstood you, or you misunderstood the doctor. I totally understand that they want their chronic pain patients on a long acting drug, I happen to agree with them on that one. I disagree that the people who scam doctors for opiates are perfectly fine. They have a terrible medical problem called addiction. It can stem from many different kinds of causes. I would far rather have chronic pain than addiction. Addiction is very difficult to treat, and is rarely cured. Take care, Annette""If your doctor really told you to drink alcohol or smoke pot to control your pain, you need to change doctors. I do have a hard time believing that though. Pot is legal here for medical reasons, some doctors have told me when I asked if it would work to ""try it and see, but all things in moderation"". I did not find that it was helpful for pain. Take care, Annette""I would discuss this with his current doctor who prescribes his medicines. I have not heard of this warning either. There are various warnings with acute head injuries that may not be appropriate with old injuries. Another thought is to ask his neurologist for a list of any meds that he should ""never"" take as opposed to drugs that he should use with caution and monitoring by his doctor. Many people use brain injuries and head injuries interchangably, so don<APO>t get hung up on the words. Talk it over with his doctor who knows his medical history and specifically what kind of brain injury he suffered. Take care, Annette""Head injuries like trauma in an accident of some kind often causes brain swelling which can cause similar brain damage as the tissue is deprived of circulation and oxygenation, like a brain injury from a cardiac arrest. When the brain swells from any injury there is no place for it to go, because the skull encases it, so it swells and squeezes in on itself, cutting off the circulation if it gets too tight. Closed head trauma can come from many causes. My son has a traumatic brain injury from the concussive situations he was in during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. You wouldn<APO>t know it to talk to him, his injury causes problems with smelling and taste and gives him the occasional headache. It all depends on what part of the brain was injured. All that said, I don<APO>t know why a doctor would say not to use hydrocodone in your cousin<APO>s husband<APO>s case. If it is an old injury, and the doctor is monitoring the patient carefully, I don<APO>t see the problem. I would go ahead and ask the doctor or nurse who said this, or ask his prescribing doctor. I am sure it will work out and they will find the right medicine for him. Take care, Annette""I assumed he meant the gentleman passed out and was revived with CPR or ACLS by the medics. I hope everyone knows that it would be highly unlikely that anyone would be clinically dead, without a heartbeat, for several hours. I assumed he had his heart stop at some point during that time. Brain damage is common after CPR type rescues. You are right, even in cold temperature cases, survival is highly unlikely after that long. Although the doctors in the ERs where I worked always said ""They aren<APO>t dead until they are warm and dead."" I lived where is was cold in the winters. Take care, Annette""I live in Oregon now, we never had summer this year, maybe 2-3 days of hot weather. I like this myself, but my husband hated this and is still complaining. He is a desert rat, was happiest when we lived in the high desert outside of Reno, NV. I mostly learned first hand about cold there, but it was no where near as cold as what you are talking about. We have been here for ten-twelve years now, I told him we could move back to the high desert somewhere, but he doesn<APO>t like moving like I do. So, here we are. My brother got as far as Santa Fe, NM, his son is in Colorado. I have visited Colorado, I think it is nice there. I would never live near the Great Lakes though, too cold for me. I really do best physically in a moderate climate, not too hot or too cold. Oregon is actually pretty good for me. Take care of yourself. Annette""I would just tell him what happened and how you are feeling. I would let him decide what to suggest and then talk about it with him. All meds work differently for different people. Take care, Annette""Hi, Beth I am so glad to hear that you found a combo that seems to be working for you. Great news!!! I also adore my doctor. Take care, Annette""Hey, Beth Have you gotten your meds in order? Any kind of med change can cause all kinds of depression and emotional stuff in most people. Get up out of that bed!!!! You know that is not the answer, give yourself a couple of hours to feel lousy, then get up and get moving. Don<APO>t clean unless you want to, but get your body up and going. Do one little chore while you are up, lol. My husband retired this year, and we are still butting heads about whose way is the best way of doing things at home. Of course, I know my way works, it has for years, lol. Fortunately, he loves me, and I love him. He has no problem with me not doing housework until I feel like it. You take good care of yourself. Hugs, Annette""I am so glad to hear you are up again, even though it hurts a lot. There are far too many possible complications from immobility. You know them all I am certain. If you can<APO>t walk, get up in a chair at least. Do whatever you can. Your pain sounds far out of control, is your doctor adjusting your treatments, meds? Hugs, Annette""Have your doctor take a look, then get a exercise plan from him. Maybe 15 minutes is too much to start out, we can<APO>t tell you, a doctor has to be able to look at your foot/ankle. Take care, Annette""My favorite FMS site is at http://www.myalgia.com , lots of good medical info to read and you can print it out and take it to your doctor and ask him if perhaps this is what you have. I have FMS, and I really do not believe that there is any special diet that makes it better. I would make sure you take in enough calcium and magnesium, and B vitamins. Most ""one a day"" type vitamins or prenatal vitamins have most of what you need. You might ask your doctor to check your vit. D and vit. B12 levels to make sure they are okay. Too little of either one may make pain worse. Most people come out okay though, as long as they get a half hour or so of sunshine every day to keep their body making enough vit. D. A good history and physical exam should lead the doctor to the correct diagnosis. Lab tests to rule out other illnesses with similar symptoms are usually done. But, there is no lab test for FMS specifically. Take care, Annette""I frankly have not had procedures done for pain, so although my answer would be no, some people might assume I had procedures that did not work. Take care, Annette""Just my perspective, but I would opt to increase or change my oral meds rather than have a pain med pump installed in my body with all the risks of a surgical procedure. Take care, Annette""I do not know what kinds of drugs you have already been on, and of course, the first person you should rely on for medical advice is your doctor. That said, I would try different kinds and amounts of oral meds before I would ever allow a pump to be installed in my body. I don<APO>t feel like the surgical options available for chronic pain, the drug pumps and SCS devices have good enough outcomes to balance the possible adverse effects according to the studies I have read, mostly ones that Charles has provided here. I can<APO>t see myself ever having one of those things done to me. One person posted her who lost her insurance and could no longer afford to have her pump refilled. She went on oral meds instead, even though she liked how the pump was working for her at the time. Most people still have to take oral pain meds from what I have heard. I guess if you were on really high opiate doses and still not getting any relief it might seem worthwhile. It does not seem like you are on high enough doses at this time to justify that to me. I am not sure why you don<APO>t want to try Oxycontin, I think that all the opiates are pretty much the same, different doses of course, but similar adverse effects and pain relief. Methadone and one or two others work slightly differently, but not that much differently to not take them at all. The Opana ER formulas go up to 40 mg. tablets according to my drug book, so I can<APO>t really believe that the two 20 mg. tablets you take per day, is the highest dose available. Even taking one 40 mg. tablet twice a day is twice as much as you are currently taking. Your doctor may have a good reason for not wanting you to go any higher, or his practice group may have set certain doses as the highest they will go. You will have to talk to your doctor and pharmacist to see what the deal is with you and Opana. I understand the feelings you sometimes have about just wanting to die, I had those feelings many years ago. I hope that if they continue you see a therapist, as I did. They can help you get past those feelings. I think most of us with chronic pain get those feelings at some point in time, the trick is to get past them and move on. There are two books that really have helped me over the years. ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"" by Dr. Margaret A. Caudill, MD, PhD, and ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns, MD. Both use many techniques from cognitive behavioural therapy. I find these very helpful. Both books have forms at the back that you can copy and use to track your progress. I think that is essential. Sometimes our progress seems so slow that we want to give up. But if you track it carefully, you will look back and see that you ARE making progress. Congrats on the new grand-baby to be. I have 4 year old and 16 year old grandsons, they are great. I didn<APO>t meet the 16 year old until he was 12, but I got in on the baby stuff with the little one. I just wish I lived closer so I could see them more often. Take care, Annette""The ""Patch"" has fentanyl in it (not morphine), and is only for folks who have already developed a tolerance for opiates, from what you say about your meds, you aren<APO>t on opiates yet, just muscle relaxants. There are also other kinds of meds and treatments to try in addition to opiates and muscle relaxants. It would make more sense when you decide you need opiates to start out on oral opiates and see how you do, then advance to the fentanyl patches as needed, than to start out on fentanyl patches. You could overdose and die just starting out on the patches without having a tolerance already to opiates. Take care, Annette""I have never had these kinds of procedures done. I also have FMS and DDD in my neck, although I do believe that spinal issues can trigger the FMS and that the FMS can make the pain from other sources even worse, I do not believe that FMS is a trash diagnosis, and that these kinds of procedures can cure it. I do believe in a pcp or other prescribing doc getting occasional consults from pain management doctors if they are prescribing opiates. My pcp continues to prescribe my meds, but the consult is in my record. It keeps everyone safer. I had a consult with a PM doc when I first moved to Oregon and again last year after 10-12 years here. Both times the doctors were very thorough, and then advised that I could continue on the opiates my PCP was giving me. They were wonderful doctors. Neither of them suggested any kind of injections or procedures be done. When I first moved to Oregon and discovered they had state guidelines for prescribing opiates for non-malignant pain, I wondered how well it would work. I have found it works very well. I would ask the PM doctor for articles of studies that show this to be an effective and safe treatment for FMS, I would also ask him for his complication rate, infections, etc. How many has he done already for your type of pain, what his success rate is, and what he considers success? Is that the same way you define success? Take care, Annette""I had a substitute pharmacist insist that my doctor had to write her DEA # on the RX. The pharmacy had it on record and I had been filling RX there for nearly ten years without that written on each RX. If it is the law, then it is the law, so I asked her nicely if she could refill it this one time and in the future, I reminded my doc to write it in. I noticed that the new batch of RX pads she got had it printed on them, so I doubt this pharmacist was the only one that insisted it be done correctly. If this was a substitute, you may never see her again, so I wouldn<APO>t worry about it. If you have an ongoing problem with the patches coming off, you will have to deal with that. I don<APO>t use patches for a number of reasons so I don<APO>t know first hand what to do about that. That said, I would probably not have left my RX with them without figuring it out for certain. My usual pharmacy was shorthanded last week over the holiday weekend, only one pharmacist on duty, no techs. I went in on Sat. and he told me he was three days behind filling RXs and didn<APO>t know when it would be ready. I told him the following day would be fine, or even Monday. He said he could not guarantee it, so I took my RX and went next door and filled it there. I called my doctor<APO>s office and told them I would be changing pharmacies. Just do what you think is right for you. I don<APO>t like being hung up and not knowing. I like things settled. Take care, Annette""Some doctors prescribe it that way if the patient does not get adequate pain control waiting the whole 72 hours. You just go by what your doctor and you have decided is right for you. Take care, Annette""There is a big difference between ""addicted to"" and ""dependent upon"". When one is addicted, they are seeking out the drug to get high rather than for pain. If your B/F has real pain, and that is what he is treating, and he is not taking more than prescribed, and it works, then I doubt there is a real problem. If it no longer works, then he needs to talk to the doctor about that. He must be seeing the doctor occasionally to get the RXs for the pain meds. It is a shame that he cannot get it fixed. I use my hot tub and stretching exercises for pain, in addition to my meds. He might try ice also, whatever the doctor suggests. Take care, Annette""If you are seeing a competent doctor I would stick with him and let him know what your feelings are. Not all of us live on pain pills, but many of us do. They certainly make my life better. Diabetics, and folks with hypertension (high blood pressure) often must take pills for the rest of their lives. I do what I can, and take my meds. I find exercise and my hot tub are the best things I can do for myself. Take care, Annette""I would see a neurologist myself. Not a surgeon, because I would not do surgery unless there were no other choice. I had pain where you are talking about and it was coming from my cervical spine. That does not mean his is coming from there though. He needs to see a doctor and maybe stick with just one. Take care, Annette""I would get a second opinion from another neurologist who is not in the same group as your present neurologist. See what he thinks about the RSD diagnosis. An injection can hit the sciatic nerve and that usually heals up fairly quickly, it is just one of those rare side effects of IM injections. However, an inflammed sciatic nerve can also trigger RSD. I would also be looking for skin changes and color changes, without them, I would also question the diagnosis. A second opinion at this point, new eyes to look at all the scans, etc, and examine you might help. Take care, Annette""You should never take advil and naproxen on the same day, they are both NSAIDs and can cause stomach bleeding. I would call him BEFORE taking any extra pain pills, not after. You toughed it out before you got the pills, tough it out again until you speak to him. I would make an appt. to see him rather than playing the phone game. It is unlikely that you will be pain free even with plenty of pain pills. Folks with chronic pain try to find a balance of pain and pain control so that they can function day to day. If you chase being pain free, you will end up on lots of meds and still not ever attain that goal. Take care, Annette""I disagree about the NSAIDs for chronic pain. I used them for DDD in my cervical spine for two years, and they worked pretty well for me. I was able to put off having any kind of surgery for pain. I ended up having surgery for loss of function, but not for pain. Inflammation can cause pain, and not be doing anything useful once you get to the chronic state of an illness. Take care, Annette""I would have asked him to start tapering me immediately rather than have to do it more quickly. 200 mg. of methadone daily is an unusually high dose for pain management. Because of how methadone works I suspect that what you go through when you realize you have forgotten your dose IS anxiety related, or related to increased pain perhaps, but not withdrawal symptoms. However, stopping methadone at 200 mg. per day will cause withdrawal symptoms, just not that quickly. There is a reason why they suggest tapering the dose slowly down. Orthopedists are surgeons, not pain management doctors, I am a bit confused over why an orthopedic group would be taking over a pain management clinic? I would start looking for a new pain management doc right away, do not wait until this guy tells you for certain that he is leaving. You said you are going to a hospital pain clinic, and that this doctor is leaving due to a disagreement with the hospital, is he the only PM doctor at the clinic there? Something sounds fishy. Take care, Annette""I would not want to taper off as a first choice, but if your doctor is leaving and you may have a hard time finding a replacement doctor in your area, better to start the taper now than just all of a sudden be without your medicine. Usually, a doctor is expected to give his patients 30 days notice if he is leaving the practice. It sounds like your doctor has done that. Some states require that a doctor give his patients a referral to a new doctor or a list of several other doctors in the community that are accepting new patients, but he cannot guarantee that they will continue the same treatment as you are getting now. other states leave it up to the individual patients to find their own doctors. Good luck with this change in your life. I hope it goes smoothly. Take care, Annette""The problem with high doses of methadone is that apparently they can cause a dose related problem with the cardiac rhythm. I do not know if this is why people on methadone have a harder time getting the higher doses or not. You would have to have that discussion with your doctor. Clearly, he wants to get away from managing chronic pain with daily opioid medication. So, he will begin doing procedures instead. Is he doing this because the insurance companies pay better for procedures and injections? Or is he doing it because he is tired of dealing with the drug abusers that try and get meds? Only he knows this. Maybe he just needs a change. Take care, Annette""I would have him evaluated by a pain management specialist if he hasn<APO>t seen one already. A gerontologist might also be helpful, they specialize in the elderly, and are more familiar with their reactions to medications, etc. Take care, Annette""You have to be very careful with opioids in the elderly especially if he is on some other medications. Opioids increase the risk of falling, and he is already at high risk for that due to his other health issues. I am not saying he shouldn<APO>t have them, just that he needs to be carefully monitored and supervised with any dose or medication change. Take care, Annette""When I first started taking vicodin I noticed that it gave me a burst of energy, I felt a bit wired. But, that feeling went away after a few months on a daily dose. Check with your state to find out the legalities of driving while taking pain meds, it is different in different states. I would question the safety of driving while ""really sleepy"". It may be safer to drive another time. Take care, Annette""The ER only does the emergency stuff, then you follow up with your doctor like they told you to. Losing bladder control is not normal, tell your doctor in Portland and decide together what to do. Take care, Annette""I am sure Dr. Maine will chime in when he sees this. I take methadone for chronic pain also. I believe the risks are dose related. I do know that with a higher dose comes the risk of cardiac rhythm problems, but if you are on a reasonable dose, I wouldn<APO>t worry about that. I had a basline EKG done some time ago, so I don<APO>t need to get that done. I have avoided increasing my dose so far. Why does your doctor want you off of it? Does he give you a clear reason? Take care, Annette""Hi, Jackie Methadone mixed with any alcohol at all is bad for your liver, I know that, but I don<APO>t know anything else about it hurting your liver. It sounds like you have a complicated health history, I would trust your doctor, or get a second opinion and see what you get. If I had any heart rhythm problems I would probably stay away from methadone. Just my opinion. There are lots of other pain meds, I personally believe that relief is pretty much the same from all of them once the correct dose is found. 40 mg. of methadone twice a day is a significant dose, you would need a lot of any other med to equal that. Please continue to post. Take care, Annette""Thanks for the information, Dr. Maine. Take care, Annette""Discuss it with your current pcp first. If he can<APO>t take care of it with you, ask to see a neurologist and a pain management specialist. Take care, Annette""First, I would see an allergist to make sure you are having an allergic reaction, rather than side effects. If they are just side effects, there may be medications you can take along with them to stop the side effects until they go away. Most side effects like itching and nausea go away after a few weeks of use. There are other opioid meds without codeine, hydrocodone and oxycodone in them. Levorphanol, methadone, fentanyl, and oxymorphone come right to mind. There may be others also. I would stick with the dilaudid as long as it works, but maybe try it in a long acting form. I think there is one available now, Exalgo? Take care, Annette""One reason doctors do not prescribe opiates for frequent migraines is that the opiates themselves will often cause rebound headaches or daily migraines which are much more difficult to treat than regular old migraines. Opiate side effects like sedation are also often counter productive to living an active functional life. They also have other issues like diversion and abuse that many of the other migraine meds do not have. I have had migraines for about 25 years, and there are many cheap, generic drugs that will often work. I use reglan 10 mg. with aspirin 675 mg. at the onset of a migraine and get complete relief about 85% of the time. I add compazine 10 mg. about an hour later if it does not work. I have not had to go to the ER for a migraine for over ten years now. Neurontin is a drug that I started to take for FMS pain and it also seems to have had the effect of decreasing the frequency and severity of my migraines. I take it daily. I have used a variety of different prevention meds over the years, it is sad but it does take trying different things to find what work for you. To save money, you can go to free or low cost clinics for your care. You can also use old generic drugs, and buy just a few at a time to see if they work. Many are covered on WalMart<APO>s $4 a month plan. Opiates are not covered on this plan for the most part, at least not where I live. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know the answer to your question. However, I saw a neurologist years ago for migraines, and he told me if one preventive medicine worked well for me for quite awhile, and then stopped working to go off of it for at least six weeks then go back on it again. He said in his practice this usually worked, he was right in my case too, the old meds did work again for me. I figured out a plan to alternate different meds. I don<APO>t know if this would work for you too, but it is a thought. A woman I knew once used Lidoderm patches for TN, she would cut them up and stick them on. Looked funny, but she said it helped. Take care, Annette""My husband had one leg shorter than the other until he had a hip replacement and they adjusted the prosthetic for that. He just put heel pads in his shoes, one on top of the other to even out the difference. He never asked a doctor about it, he just did it. It worked for him. The surgeon who fixed his hip noticed and told him whatever worked was fine with him and he would try and fix that too. Most people are not quite symmetrical so I don<APO>t know how much of a difference the shape of your spine makes day to day. FMS makes any pain feel worse so I think it does contribute to this problem. Finding the right doctor, one who is willing to listen to you is so important. Take care, Annette""Find a doctor who treats a lot of FMS patients and work with one doctor. I don<APO>t know what a ""normal"" life is anymore, but you can have a happy, and productive life with FMS. I do. I strongly recommend http://www.myalgia.com for good FMS information. Just read the articles, you can print them out if you wish. Take them to your doctor if you feel he would be receptive. They are from serious medical professionals, not crazy people who claim to have a cure. There is no cure for FMS, nothing will fix everything 100%. You just do the best you can. My hot tub and exercise are both excellent aids for me. Along with medicines of various kinds. We are all different, so we have to just try different meds until we find the right combo for each of us. Take care, Annette""I also eliminated caffeine from my diet a few years back. I did it to decrease irritable bladder symptoms, and it worked well for that. It didn<APO>t reallyhelp my other FMS symptoms, but it was worth it to be able to go to the movies and sit through an entire movie without getting up to go to the bathroom. Keep looking for a regular doctor, I adore mine. Take care, Annette""You can do a lot of screening over the phone with the office staff. I call the office and ask for the nurse or medical asst. that is in charge. Then I tell her a bit about me, what my diagnoses are, and what kind of doctor I prefer. I ask her which of the doctors in the group might be the best fit for me. If she says they would all be wonderful, I thank her and hang up and move on.When I find one who seems to really think about it and who recommends one or two out of the group, I make an appt. So far, I have been able to find a doctor over the phone this way in two new towns where I have lived. I never had to go to more than one doctor. I live on the West Coast, so I can<APO>t help you with a doctor in KS, sorry. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t happen to have this condition, but there are folks here who do, so they will respond soon. I have read that nerve blocks are often done, have you had any of those? Take care, Annette""Hi, Gail I am sorry you are feeling so bad. I believe the psych exam is only to see if you understand why you are having the SCS put in and that your expectations of relief are reasonable. Being depressed would not disqualify you, at least I don<APO>t think it would. Only you can decide where you would want to move, but I would think moving where you might get the most help if you needed it in the fairly near future would be best. it sounds like you have some nice choices anyhow. Don<APO>t feel like a failure because you are considering the SCS, it is there for folks who have not had success with the lesser options, you have certainly tried them all at this point. It seems like a reasonable decision now. The belly dancing is going great, lol. I found a place on line where I could order appropriate clothing for cheap, and new instructional DVDs, I have found several teachers that I like. I am still only doing it alone, but I did tell my son about it, he is an adult and lives far away. He thought it was great and had a good laugh with me too. I am up to an hour and a half to two hours every day. The extra activity is great, even if it does hurt more, the hot tub awaits, lol. My doctor loves that I am doing it too. Keep up the painting. Like the dancing, it does not matter how good we are according to everyone else, it is what it does for us that counts. So good to hear from you. Hugs, Annette""I am so sorry. I would try to work your way out of the depression so that you would be a candidate for the SCS if that is the way you want to go. The two books that you mentioned will probably help. A third one I would suggest is ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns, MD. My old therapist gave me that one when I moved away. I wish she had suggested it sooner, lol. I used it on my own, and worked through my depression, I was suicidal at the time. I have never been depressed since. I just picked out the techniques that I thought would help me. It is probably better to use his whole program, but you know me, I always think I know best. It is all about cognitive behavioural therapy. I am a real believer in CBT. Medical studies have since shown it to be as effective as some antidepressants. You can use it with a therapist or on your own, with meds or without. I think it would be as useful for the panic attacks as for depression, but ask your doctor. Discuss this ALL with your doctor. Tomorrow will be a new day. I don<APO>t pray because I think God takes care of everyone, not just those who pray or have folks pray for them. But I will think happy thoughts for you, light a candle, etc. Hugs, Annette""Canna butter is a type of butter with marijuana in it. You can use it to make a drink, or add it to foods to get the effects of marijuana without smoking it. The pills with THC in them are called Marinol. It is legal in all states, you just get your doctor to write a RX for it and try it out. They don<APO>t get you high, just give you the medicine. Some folks do not believe that THC is the only part of marijuana that helps folks in pain. Thus canna butters or smoking pot. I tried both smoking and eating pot many years ago for pain and it did not work for me. Hugs, Annette""I am so happy for you. I hope the SCS trial works out well for you. Any time they cut the skin, it IS surgery, so do take it seriously. I am glad the doctor is, and is requiring all the appropriate pre-op workup labs. If he has done hundreds of them and has a good infection rate, I would go ahead with him too. Infections seem to be the number one complication of most surgeries. Do not take that lightly, infections can be serious and even deadly. It is always a surgical risk, but less of a risk in the hands of a good surgeon, in a good hospital. I got a call from my brother a day or two ago, and although he had one binge recently, it was shorter than they had been and he got right back to work on staying sober. He found an intensive out patient program in the evenings, as he must find work to support himself in the daytime. He was accepted in, and seems to be doing well. He has been in that program for a few weeks now. I am very proud of him. Thank you for mentioning him in your post. He needs all the positive thoughts/prayers he can get. I do not think that medical marijuana is effective enough to risk if you have an addiction problem or alcoholism. Mainly because I think it is not appropriately supervised by doctors as far as the amount one uses, etc. It is for the most part self regulated. My doctors just told me ""moderation in all things"" would be best. No advice as far as dosing or anything else, far different than any RX drugs they might prescribe. Please let me know how things go as you move on this path. It is hard, but I think you will do fine. Hugs, Annette""Hi, Gail I am so sorry to hear that your RSD has spread to your other foot. I will think good thoughts for you, let me know how you are doing when you feel up to it. Hugs, Annette""You need to see your doctor and have some basic blood work done. That will be a start in him being able to make a diagnosis as to what is happening with your toe. We can<APO>t begin to guess what is happening. Take care, Annette""Did the medical asst. give you any reason at all? Did she call you on the phone? Tell you in person? Other than trying to make an appt. to see the doctor face to face and ask him what the issues are, I don<APO>t know what to say. I don<APO>t believe in dealing with any pain issues on the phone, I always make an appt. and see my doc face to face. I don<APO>t think you will go through serious withdrawals if you are only taking 15 mg. of oxycodone daily. Opiate withdrawals are managable and only last a week or so. Your usual pain will probably come back and may seem even worse. You might make an appt. with your pcp and see if he/she is aware of what is going on, and is willing to take care of your pain issues. The PM doc may have sent your pcp a letter informing them of your release. In most states a doctor has to give a patient 30 days notice and RXs for 30 days if he dismisses the patient. However, if you broke any rules of the practice, he can let you go without any notice or RXs. Take care, Annette""This thread is about 9 months old, you will get more responses if you post this as a new post. That said, I assume you are taking Oxycontin, (because of the dose and schedule you mentioned), the long acting form of oxycodone, is that true? Let the new doctor know what you have been taking and if he won<APO>t prescribe drugs on the first visit, ask him what you should do to mitigate withdrawal symptoms. Who has been prescribing this med for you? Are you on any break through meds? Discuss with this doctor the possibility that he could write you for enough meds to last until your new PM doctor will prescribe them for you if necessary. Your post is confusing because we can<APO>t tell who is prescribing the current meds, is it the ""regular doctor""? Waiting until you are completely out (tomorrow) before dealing with this makes it more difficult for you. Take care, Annette""If you signed an agreement that you would not get any pain meds from any other doctor, that is probably why you were dismissed. You will have to make an appt. and go see the doctor if he will see you. Try and discuss it with him, be prepared to show him your pills and how the count works out correctly. Otherwise, see your pcp and ask for a referral to another PM doc if he won<APO>t take care of this for you. Take care, Annette""If she got pain pills from another doctor after signing an agreement with her PM doc that she would not do that, that IS cause to terminate her treatment. At least it is with my doctor and the other doctors around here. It says that clearly in the agreement I signed. Take care, Annette""I would go see your doctor first. Explain to him what is going on, write it all down ahead of time so you don<APO>t forget anything. After he listens to you and examines you, he may need further testing. At the end he may be able to make a real diagnosis. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know why I didn<APO>t suggest it before, but when you see your doctor ask for an occupational therapist consultation. They are great at configuring your work station for best results. Sitting at a computer for hours a day, can cause all kinds of pain if it isn<APO>t set up right. I used to have my monitor far too high up. My OT suggested that it be 20 degrees lower than eye level when sitting in my chair. This puts my neck with DDD in the correct position. I didn<APO>t use a computer much at work, just at home. It has made all the difference for me. I worked in a home health program as a nurse, and the PT and OT women that I worked with were wonderful. They really helped my patients in practical ways. Take care, Annette""I would get a second opinion from another neurologist. What does his surgeon say? Has he seen a urologist? A pain management specialist? Take care, Annette""I have had no side effects from the methadone I take for FMS pain, if anything I am much more active now than I was before I started taking it. I find it a very useful medication. I switched from another opiate to methadone almost a year ago to save money. I requested the change and my doctor went along with it. My husband also took it for about a year or so without any problems. Then he had his hip fixed and tapered off of it in a month or two without any withdrawal effects at all. I think in your poll you should include a place for ""no problems"", all you include are negative comments. Take care, Annette""I would imagine you would still be in some pain. I had a cervical discectomy without a fusion, my doctor gave me vicodin for about six weeks, then cut it off. Surgeons are not trained to manage chronic pain at all. I had to ask mine to send me to PT. I had pain in the same area you did. PT did great stuff for me, cured the pain entirely. They used electrical stimulation on the tight muscles in my shoulders/neck for about three weeks. I did not have my surgery for pain as my surgeon told me there was only about a 50% chance that the surgery would help with pain. I had mine because my hands were losing function. Take care, Annette""Hi, Bren. Always good to see you. My two favorite books are ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns, MD, and ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"" by Dr. Margaret A. Caudill, MD, PhD. Both include cognitive behavioural therapy techniques. I find these to have turned my life around. I know I didn<APO>t pay any more than $30 apiece for these books. You can order them from a big book store chain, if they don<APO>t have them in stock. I saw a therapist for awhile, and when I moved away she turned me onto the first book. I read it on my own and started using the techniques that seemed to fit me. I think it is probably better to do the whole program in order, but I didn<APO>t do that. I have given copies of this book to friends and family and every one got something from it. The second book I got on my own, it was in a nursing book club offering. But, others have gotten copies of it too, it is not just available to nurses. It is a great book. Take care, Annette""Relaxation and meditation both help pain that is ""real"". There are lots of different techniques to use to decrease the levels of pain you get. A huge percentage of the pain you ""feel"" is the emotional response that you have to the pain impulses. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""I would go see your orthopedic doctor. Because this is a recent change he may want to do some imaging tests to help figure things out. If he has no answers the next thing would be to see a pain management doctor.There are lots of options for pain management. Take care, Annette""I am so glad that you saw your doctor. I hope the PT works for you. I have had sciatica a couple of times over the years, my doc treated it with a short course of oral steroids, and it went away both times. The last time was over 12 years ago. Take care, Annette""Check the lot numbers of your patches, they should be on the label. If you have more than one lot number, try a different lot number next time you change the patch, and see if you get the same thing. If you find you only get these symptoms with one particular lot number, call the manufacturer and ask for their adverse effects department. Tell them what you have said here, and tell them the lot number of the patches that you have a problem with. They can trace them back and check to see if they are faulty. They will also tell you what to do with the rest of those patches from that lot. If you get the same symptoms no matter what lot you use, it is probably not the patches. Discuss this whole thing with your doctor and your pharmacist regardless. That should be your first step. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t think any opioid is more dangerous than another. Many people use the fentanyl patch and get good results from it, some get lousy side effects. Some people get few to no side effects other than constipation, which happens with all opioids. I have personally never used the patches, I like my hot tub too much to be willing to give it up. I use oral meds instead. The good thing for all of us is that there are lots of alternatives in pain management. Take care, Annette""I have never heard of side effects like that from any opiate, but if you have not taken any oxycodone for two months, I don<APO>t think it was causing the problem. I suspect your primary is right and your mental health doctor is incorrect or that the symptoms are not due to any meds at all. What psych meds are you on? Take care, Annette""Any meds can cause side effects, even if their doses were not changed at that time. They may build up in your system and get to a level where they bother you, or something else may change in your system that allows those kinds of side effects to pop up. Klonopin has a very long half life and can build up in your system over time, I know that from personal experience. It is not a good drug for me for sure. I have not taken the others, but many of the older antidepressants and antipsychotics could cause problems over time. TDXSP08 says the same thing about the Seroquel. It may also be the combination of certain drugs causing certain effects. I might discuss this all with your pharmacist also. Often none of the various doctors want to deal with side effects so all of them will blame the meds of some other doctor, childish. This is one reason I prefer to have one doctor presribe ALL my meds. When you see the neurologist, ask him about any medicine issues with all your meds, including interactions, and long term use. Take care, Annette""You need to see your doctor and get a workup and a diagnosis. Then we can help you with our experiences with that kind of illness. I personally think it is best to find one doctor that you feel good with, then stick with him/her. Take care, Annette""I assume you are not in the US, as methadone RXs cannot be faxed here. I would make an appt. with your doctor and talk to him face to face. Take in your last RX bottle and the records from your pharmacy if you can get them. We can here. Let him know that you have had problems with this person in his office in the past. He may not even be aware of that, many people are too afraid to rock the boat, so they don<APO>t tell their doctors if the office staff is rude to them. I hope you get this all worked out. Take care, Annette""I would let the doctor know just what happened, and ask him how to prevent it in the future. By trying to be part of the solution, he will be more likely to think positively about you. He probably did not even know there was a problem. Like you I follow all the rules to a Tee, never cause any problems. I<APO>ve never had any either though. That is the last thing I need. Take care, Annette""It is illegal to get percocets refilled by phone, you have to get the paper RX from the doctor. If you work out somethign with the doctor, he can give you vicodin, that can be refilled by phone. He may just feel he needs to assess you before giving you more meds. Are you taking anything else for pain? There are other meds appropriate for RA, sometimes if you only ask for opiates it looks more like you are drug seeking than in pain. You didn<APO>t mention how long you have been seeing this doctor, does he know you well? If not, once he gets to know you and trust you, he may be loser with the meds. Did he instruct you to take that much advil at one time, every four hours? Probably not, it is dangerous for your stomach at that dose and every four hours, it is only supposed to be taken every 8 hours at the higher doses. He may feel if you can<APO>t control yourself and follow instructions with advil, he doesn<APO>t want to give you narcotics. I would suggest you stick to the instructions with the advil and tell him that it isn<APO>t allowing you enough pin relief to do your activities of daily living, or whatever your goal is. It takes about three weeks of constant scheduled dosing to get the best anti-inflammatory response according to my doctor. We have a right to pain management, we do not have a right to narcotics specifically. They are good drugs in certain settings, and often in combination with other drugs. But, they are also highly abused, so we have to have a trusting relationship with our doctors. Take care, Annette""I certainly did not judge you, nor did I say you were a drug seeker. You asked how else to handle things and I made a few suggestions based on what little information you provided. There is nothing in either vicodin or percocet that will reduce swelling and inflammation, so if the swelling/redness/heat goes down promptly when you take a pain pill and elevate/ice your leg, it is the elevation/ice that is doing the job not the pain pill. Those two types of medicine only reduce pain not swelling and inflammation. That is enough of a reason to take pain meds of course. In your original post you said that 40 pills lasted you from early Jan. until recently, a bit less than 2 months. This time you said they last three months. I don<APO>t understand why you are having a hard time getting meds from your doctor since you have had a long, trusting relationship with him. I guess my question would be, ""Why do YOU think he wouldn<APO>t call in more vicodin for you when you called him and told him how much pain you were in?"" I hope you feel better soon. Take care, Annette""Some primary care docs are comfortable with pin management, and some are not. I am glad the orthopedic doctor feels okay about giving you the vicodin. I hope the injection helps too. Keep on elevating and icing your knee in addition to the vicodin (as long as that is what the doc told you to do). That will control the swelling and make it easier for the vicodin to do its job. Take care, Annette""I would not rely on a chiropractor to diagnose a problem. That is what MDs and DOs, are for. Also just because you have a negative MRI does not mean you can<APO>t have pain. There does not seem to be a correlation between MRI results and pain. I would not worry so much about more tests as I would want a good clinical doctor who can take a history and do a good medical examination and decide what to do next. See what the PM doctor says, we can<APO>t guess what he will suggest next. If in doubt, get a second opinion. Take care, Annette""Just because you see a doctor, does not mean you must take any medications. The doctor may have other types of treatment that will help you. Swank is right, you need to see a doctor just to initiate a W/C claim. It may go nowhere as most people recover from a back injury without any problems, but it will also protect you to some extent if you have future problems. You need to establish a paper trail. Did you file an injury report at the time at work? Take care, Annette""Are there other things you can adjust besides your BT meds? Things like heat/ice, stretching, etc.? I would try those things first, then discuss it with your doctor, and tell him what you have already tried. Then I adjust other meds first if possible, then the opiates last, if necessary. Everyone has to decide how much pain they are willing to tolerate before changing their meds. It is an individual thing. Take care, Annette""Hi Bren, and everyone else too. I went to the FDA website and looked up the requirements for generic drugs. I found nothing about the 80% rule or ""Class AB"" drugs requiring less than the stated dose on the label. What is did find was that ALL generics must have exactly the same dose of the same drug as the brand name drugs, and that they must act in the same amount of time as the original drug. Generic drug companies must show studies that prove that in order to get their generic drug approved. My DIL has worked in drug company labs and in their adverse reaction dept. for her entire working life, and she also says this is bogus. She currently works for a big company that mostly handles generic drugs, they keep some pills back from every lot number, so if they have any complaints, they can go back and test the pill from that lot and see if there was any difference. She has also commented that no generic drugs that change anything that can be validated with lab work, tests, etc. are ever complained about. The main complaints are about pain meds, and other meds that affect how one feels. From personal experience, I have used many, many different generics and a few brand name drugs (when the generics were not available) over the years, including Malinkrodt, and have never noticed any difference at all. I personally feel that pain is such a variable experience that it would be really hard to tell if it was the pill, or just a difference in your pain levels for that day. The placebo effect also works into this whole thing, if you believe something will work better, it will, at least for awhile. I think a randomized, double blinded study would be the only way to go, and these support the use of generics so far. Anyone who has a double blind study that shows that generic drugs work less well than brand name drugs should post the link to the study, I would love to read it. The thing with tylenol and percocet is that the total daily tylenol dose must be controlled. If the doctor ordered a dose of percocet and a dose of tylenol and still stayed within the appropriate limit of daily tylenol use, that would be fine. I don<APO>t see a problem with that. As long as the doctor monitors the patient, it should be okay. As always discus this with your doctor and with your pharmacist. With some of the newer formulas of oxycodone/acetaminophen having lower acetaminophen (tylenol) doses, it should be possible to do this and stay within the recommended daily doses. Older studies did show that tylenol and oxycodone used together do potentiate their pain controlling ability. I don<APO>t think this should be done without a doctor<APO>s supervision on ones own though. Just my opinion, lol. Always discuss these things with your doctor before changing anything based on what you read on line at any site. Take care, Annette""I am sure the doctor will reply soon. Meanwhile, I would suggest you go to the doctor and get an examination. There are a variety of things that can cause pain in the testicles.None can be diagnosed on line though. Take care, Annette""All you can do is see your doctor. If he cannot tell you why this is still causing you pain, ask for a referral to an orthopedic surgeon and see what he says. I would be wary of taking more than the written instructions say without seeing the doctor or talking to HIM (not someone else) on the phone. Take care, Annette""There are EMERGENCIES regarding sudden, severe testicular pain. Testicular torsion, where the testicle twists, can cause infertility and permanent damage. I hope by this time either the pain is gone, or he has relented and seen a doctor. Nothing you can do without his cooperation, but hopefully, threatening him with permanent damage to his testicles might help. Take care, Annette""I agree, the pain in TT is usually severe enough to get the guy to the doctor pretty quickly, but some guys are really reluctant to see a doctor about their genitals. If you put off seeing the doctor for too long, you can lose a testicle from torsion. Waiting for a urologist appt. could be too long. I feel the ER is the right place to check this out. It isn<APO>t my place to make a diagnosis, just to give people the info they need to make a decision. Take care, Annette""A fasciotomy is usually an emergency procedure done to save the limb. I would think nerve damage would be an unexpected but possible side effect of this kind of surgery. You may not have even noticed it at first due to the other things that were going on in the hospital. Pain is a common thing under those circumstances, so it would seem right to me that you would only figure it out later on. I would let the doctor know what you are feeling and adjust your meds accordingly. Often chronic pain means pain of some degree forever, it is a matter of learning to control that pain the best we can so the patient/us can still live a happy, productive life. I am an older nurse (now retired due to a chronic pain condition), and an aortic aneurysm used to mean death most of the time, if not all the time. I recall a patient of mine dying from that back in the 70s, right in front of me, there was not a thing we could do for him. I am so glad for all the developments in medicine that have allowed us to save patients that would have died in the ""old days"". We just have to realize that now we are responsible for treating the side effects of the treatments that we now use. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know what your situation was back then, just that it is usually an emergency procedure that is used to save the limb. Maybe he led you to believe that you would walk again, because he thought you would? I don<APO>t think chronic pain or nerve damage is always expected with a fasciotomy or if they would know which patients might end up with it and which patients won<APO>t. Nerves are not always big enough to just see and avoid, many nerves are very tiny but still important. I know after I had emergency abdominal surgery half my belly was numb for years, but the feeling eventually came back after 10-12 years. It is really hard to accept changes that result in chronic pain, we always think they should be able to fix it, but the reality is they cannot always do that, or at least not yet. I hope that in the future they will have a better treatment for all kinds of chronic pain, maybe they will. Take care, Annette""Hi, Bren There are risks to all surgeries, this is one of them. Chronic pain or numbness due to severed nerves is pretty common. Some of them eventually go away, like mine did, some do not and you have permanent damage. It is not always a liability issue if we have an adverse outcome to a surgical procedure. Sometimes it is no one<APO>s fault if the outcome is not what we hoped for, it just happens. When we give consent for an operation we need to read the form and discuss the risks/benefits with the surgeon prior to the operation. If that isn<APO>t possible, we just trust the doctor to do his best, or refuse the surgery and deal with that. I have had patients who did just that. Take care, Annette""You need to see your doctor and be examined. There is a simple maneuver that the doctor can do to check for a clot in your calf. An ultrasound test can also show most of the venous system and check for clots. As I am sure you know, a long plane trip can cause blood clots in the legs, it is advisable to get up and walk around periodically or do leg exercises in your seat to prevent clots. However, running a 100 mile race could complicate making a diagnosis. Congrats on that though, it is a great accomplishment. Take care, Annette""Go back to your doctor and tell him how you have been doing. Headaches are difficult to work out, it often takes months to get a handle on them. You need to work with your doctor, if he feels unable to help you, ask for a referral to a specialist. I used to have horrible migraines up to 15 days a month, now I only get them occasionally. It takes the right combination of meds to control them. Take care, Annette""""Age-appropriate"" just means that the changes are what one would expect for someone of your age. Everyone has some changes in their spine as we age because we walk upright. Discs dry out a bit, and flatten some due to age and gravity, etc. Talk to your doctor, you should be asking HIM what he meant, we can only guess. Meanwhile be glad that you have a normal, healthy spine. That does not mean you don<APO>t have pain, but it does mean they don<APO>t have anything to operate on. That is a good thing, lol. Take care, Annette""Go see a doctor and get a proper medical examination. Wish we could help you make your own diagnosis, but that would likely not be accurate anyway. Take care, Annette""RA can affect many of the internal organs. I would trust the rheumy if he says it has affected your lungs, especially if you never smoked. An inhaler will often stop a cough as well as wheezing, use it as directed, but keep track of what symptoms it seems to affect and any side effects you get from it, so you can tell your rheumy next time you see him. All the DMARDs are tough drugs, and have some side effects. But, for many people they work well. I don<APO>t know enough about them to know the answer to your question, I would call your pharmacist and ask him.""Best of luck to you. Please keep in touch. Take care, Annette""Sounds like she knows what she is doing. DMARDs are serious drugs, anything that does all that they do needs to be handled with the greatest of care. When will she have the results of all the tests and films? Take care, Annette""Life is good. I just turned sixty, my meds are working today so my pain levels are okay. It is too bad it is taking until Dec. 2nd, but as long as you are doing well now, that is what matters at this point. Take care, Annette""The problem is the way it is set up now, you have to click and click to find the post, then click and click to get back to where you were. I don<APO>t always bother because it just takes too long. I wish WebMD would just take down posts that are extremely long and off the original topic, etc. I doubt that many posts that are six months to a year old are no longer addressing the original topic. Take care, Annette""Then don<APO>t take off the old posts, just post new posts under new discussions instead of under the old posts. WebMD made a decision to cut off posts of a certain age when they changed the format, nobody complained, so I just made that suggestion. If anyone has a problem with it, don<APO>t do it. I am just getting to the point where I don<APO>t even go back to read new posts if the original has 5 pages of posts already and is six months to a year old. If newcomers want lots of responses, it might be better to post a new discussion, that was my original suggestion. Take care, Annette""I suggest that rather than adding a new post to one that is several pages long, and is not even about the original topic that may be as much as a year old, we just start new discussions???? It is not hard to do, and it is much easier to read and respond to. If anyone has a problem starting new discussions due to a computer problem, that is different, and I understand. Take care, Annette""How long ago was your arrest for drug possession? What kind of drugs? Drug possession charges are NOT one little mistake, I do not know many people who only possessed drugs one time in their life, and happened to get arrested that one time. This is one of those things that can stick with you for many years. No doctor has ever checked my arrest record or asked me if I had been arrested before, so I am not sure how getting your records sealed would help??? I would suggest ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"", a great book by Dr. Margaret A. Caudill, MD, PhD. It has a lot of good suggestions on how to cope with chronic pain. Take care, Annette""There is a small percentage of people who may develop addiction (not just physical dependence) even if they use the opiates according to directions from a doctor. Thank goodness this is a small percentage and a low risk factor. I still watch my pills like a hawk and am very careful how I use them. Addiction is difficult to treat successfully. I am not sure where you got the number ""11"" as the number of years one may have cravings after cleaning up, but suffice it to say that one may have cravings for many years after abusing opiates. ""DTs"" are different from opiate withdrawals, DT stands for delerium tremens, a withdrawal effect from alcohol, not opiates from what I recall reading. I have also read and in my professional experience as a nurse that withdrawal from opiates alone is usually safe for an adult in generally good health. It would not cause major damage or death to detox from opiates. From what I have read, if someone had a heart condition or some other complicating factor withdrawal might be dangerous. If you have links to info regarding this, please post them, I would love to read them and discuss it. Some addicts are very skillful at hiding their addiction, they get RXs from multiple sources, and even good doctors can be fooled. The current laws protect the patients<APO> privacy, and in some states (like mine) there is no central agency keeping track of who got RXs for opiates when. Take care, Annette""Hi, Starlene27 It is always nice to have a new person with new experiences here. I value your opinions, just because you are new, does not make them less valid. It sounds like you have a variety of things in your background that would give you a different take on things than some folks here have. I happen to agree with your comments on this post. Hope you get your MRI of the pelvis soon, and find the treatment that works for you without taking you back to that dark place again. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t think doctors would get anywhere by asking for arrest/conviction records, as the folks with records would probably just say no. It is too expensive to run backgound checks on everyone, and what would the point be anyway? I don<APO>t think it is any of their business myself. Our health history and medical records are appropriate for them to ask for. I worked in a treatment center years ago for heroin addicts, and trust me there is no ""look"" for opiate addicts. I have known doctors and nurses who were addicts, middle class teenagers, etc. Take care, Annette""I didn<APO>t really understand this comment either. I guess I would have just sent them back unopened if I knew I wasn<APO>t supposed to get them in the first place. It is an odd error for a pharmacy to make. Take care, Annette""What has the doctor suggested for you for treatment of your AVN? Usually joint replacements are don if it is in the hips. What caused the AVN? Only you can decide if you need the opiates or not. If you do, you do. Take care, Annette""Men can have FMS, but you need to have chronic pain above and below the waist and on both sides of your body to be considered for that diagnosis. Discuss this with your doctor and see what he thinks. My favorite site for FMS is http://www.myalgia.com. Lots of good info there. Take care, Annette""Clearly, one must work as long as one can. I believe that the help of an occupational therapist is vital, these folk are trained to evaluate and help adjust work and home situations to decrease pain and increase function. Like Caprice said, adjusting your work station and work habits may help alot. I personally believe that it is worth the money to get a one time evaluation from an occupational therapist. You may also be eligible to get help in this area from your state department of disability and vocational rehabilitation for free. They want to keep people working. Take care, Annette""Methadone is very cheap, it is a long acting opioid. I think levorphanol is also pretty cheap, check with your pharmacist. Take care, Annette""You should always see a doctor for any new or different pain, even headaches. Your parents are right, it is probably nothing serious, but perhaps you could learn to control the headaches by not doing what you know will cause them. I would go see my family doctor and get checked out to be sure. Take care, Annette""Methadone and levorphanol are the cheapest long acting pain meds around here. I don<APO>t know where you are or what is available there, or at what prices. You might talk to your pharmacist. Take care, Annette""Morphine is available in immediate release form without any additives. Fentanyl is available in lollypop and lozenge form that you put between your cheek and gums. I understand that it is very expensive though. Take care, Annette""My husband had a hip replaced for AVN in his right hip due to traumatic injury that occurred when he fell and landed on his hip on a concrete surface from a large semi-truck. The orthopedist told him there was no reason to believe it would occur in his left hip also and that the films and his history indicated that his natural left hip should last him forever. If the AVN were due to systemic changes due to long term steroid use or alcoholism I can see where other joints may also be affected, but not with trauma if the trauma only injured the one joint. I totally agree with you that the treatments short of a joint replacement do not seem to have much of a success rate. My husband has had great releif from his pain since he had the THR and can walk without a cane or any assistance. He could barely walk prior to his surgery, with a lot of pain (in spite of good drugs) and a cane. This is a serious problem with few treatment options. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""AVN sucks, I don<APO>t know how else to put it. The treatments available other than joint replacement often do not work. My husband fell on his hip and damaged the neck of the femur between the head and the shaft. That caused a lack of blood flow to the head of the femur and it just died and collapsed in on itself. The xray was just a mess, his doctor did not know how he was walking, much less working. Thank God for joint replacement surgeries, if he had lived a generation ago, he would have been unable to walk and in terrible pain for the rest of his life. I have been a nurse for 40 years, so much has happened in that time that are just medical miracles to me, I can<APO>t even count them. My nephew was born with orthopedic problems that would have meant he would never have walked at all just a couple of decades ago. He is just fine, thanks to a great orthopedic surgeon. As a nurse there are a few chronic pain conditions that I would not wish on anyone, AVN, RSD, and trigeminal neuralgia are the three that most scare me. I am so glad to have what I do and not have any of these. My heart goes out to all of you with these conditions. Take care, Annette""Many people complain about how difficult it is to get off of Paxil, due to withdrawal symptoms from that drug. I have not personally had any difficulty getting off of drugs as long a I tapered them slowly. I used tramadol for many years as a breakthrough med, it seemed to work, and when it no longer did, I just stopped using it. I was not taking more than 100 mg. per day at that time. I did not bother tapering at that dose, and had no withdrawal symptoms. Many pain meds cause changes in the libido for the worse. It is just a bad side effect of pain meds. Take care, Annette""I would suggest that you try working with your insurance company through whatever appeals process they have. Often I have been able to get RX drugs covered this way. When changing from one opiate to another, it is common to have to adjust the dosage a few times to find the right dose of the new drug. You wife should just work with her doctor, perhaps having more frequent appts., until she has good relief from her new med. Changing opiates is not a mg. for mg. changeover process, everyone responds to different opiates in different ways. Take care, Annette""I would call back the original doctor<APO>s office and ask them for another referral, tell them that the psychiatrist they sent you to does not do pain management. Otherwise, get on the phone and keep looking. We are not allowed to post doctors<APO> names and numbers here but if you post an email address, someone may be able to help you by emailing the information. I would get a throw away address different than your personal email address, so you can toss it if you start getting spam. Hotmail, Yahoo, etc. all offer free email accounts. I keep one on Yahoo just for online use. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t really have an answer for why opiates do not work on all pain. I know from my experience that they do not work for everyone for all kinds of pain. I know part of it can be genetic. This is a very complicated genetic thing that I do not know enough about to explain clearly. I do know that anti-inflammatories decrease inflammation, which can decrease swelling, and that decreases pain. If you are not addressing the inflammation, and the swelling it causes, it will take much longer for the pain to go away, and it might stay indefinitely. Swelling can cause pain no matter what opiates you take. Even something as simple as elevating the injured arm or leg can help the body decrease swelling and inflammation and that helps the pain go down. We didn<APO>t always have anti-inflammatory drugs. I have found that opiates can help decrease most kinds of pain for me, whether or not it is neuropathic pain or not. Take care, Annette""Opiates are not the first choice in headache control. They work mainly by putting the person to sleep for awhile, and they wake up without the headache. I know when I get migraines, my opiates do not help at all, I take reglan and aspirin or reglan and ibuprofen, or plain compazine. Take care, Annette""You might try taking the Oxycontin at different times during the day and see if that helps with the insomnia. I had this side effect with a different pain pill once and it wore off after awhile, so that may happen for you too. However, I do agree with Beth. She gave you accurate information about the fentanyl path, and also about finding a different pain management doctor. I would ask before you even bother to make an appt. if they only do interventional medicine, if so, I would move on and find a different doctor. You need one who will continue your old treatment, since it worked for you. I also believe that you are more likely to find up to date treatment near a large medical center that trains new doctors. They seem to stay more up to date on newer treatments. Take care, Annette""If you have a RX already, why are you having a hard time getting it filled? My pharmacy will order drugs for me if they don<APO>t have it in stock. Take care, Annette""I doubt the new meds have cancer causing ingredients in them, I would discuss that with your pharmacist to make sure you are getting accurate information. I think to get RX filled legally in Canada, you have to see a Canadian doctor who is willing to write your RXs, but I have no personal experience so I only know what I have heard. Take care, Annette""I would let your doctor know, perhaps this is a transient side effect and will go away. But, he should at least help you out with the headaches. Take care, Annette""If she is already on pain meds from a pain management doctor or her family doctor, and has signed an agreement not to get pain meds from any other doctors, her usual prescribing doctor should still be able to manage her pain, even if she has extra pain from the procedure. Most doctors who have you sign such a document discuss it with you and tell you just how to handle this kind of situation. My husband had a family doctor, an internist, who managed his chronic pain, he had two surgeries during the time he was on these medicines. At discharge from the hospital, we simply refused the RXs for pain meds, and did not even take them home. His own doctor adjusted his meds as necessary to cover any extra pain he had. Although we live in the same state as both his doctors, we do live close to the state line, so I am sure this comes up for other folks around here. As far as I know they all handle it according to how their own doctors see fit. I don<APO>t think there is only one way that is allowed, ask your wife<APO>s doctor. Some states do have data bases where they keep track of all the RXs for controlled substances that people get, and doctors and the DEA can cross check to see if people are getting them from multiple sources. I have lived in two states where it was a felony for a person to fill RXs from more than one doctor unless they all (the doctors) knew about each other and the RXs. The patient was committing the crime and could be charged. The doctors would have to answer to their own licensing authority. I would just tell her pain doctor what she needs based on the first procedure, and see what he says. Take care, Annette""I wish you the best, and hope you can attain that goal. I hate not working, but have found volunteer work that is very satisfying, and more adjustable to my needs. Take care, Annette""There could be lots of reasons, including that it is within the normal range. The only way for you to find out, is to see a doctor. He will do a history and probably a physical, and discuss the options with you. I remember having terrible pain with my periods when I was young, no one should have to go through that. There are treatments available. I went on birth control pills to regulate my hormones, and that did it for me. No more pain!!! I was not sexually active yet, so I didn<APO>t need them for birth control. That is not the only reason for taking them. Take care, Annette""If by FMF you mean Familial Mediterranean Fever, then I would suggest genetic counseling and a second opinion. I believe this is an autosomal genetic condition where both parents must carry the recessive gene in order for the child to get the actual illness. Thus, neither parent has necessarily been sick, they just happen to marry and the two of them have the opportunity to pass the gene on to their kids. The two of you need to be tested to learn about your own genetics, and what to expect if you decide to have more kids. A genetic counselor could explain this to you far better than I. I would ALWAYS get a second opinion when it comes to my child having a chronic illness. See a specialist recommended by your family doctor and find out what your various treatment options are. There is almost always more than one option for treatment. Then you and his dad can sit down and decide what to do next. It does not sound like there is an emergency situation going on, but your doctor is the one to tell you that. If there is, then I would start treatment with the colchicine and watch carefully for side effects while you do more research. Just because a drug CAN cause side effects, does not mean that it will. I have taken many drugs over the years and had no side effects at all, others I do. You never know until you try them. High fevers can have their own effect a child<APO>s growth and development. Make another appt. with the specialist and write down your questions so you can get specific answers. Write them down too. It is easy to get nervous and not remember the answers after you get home. Do some more research while ou are waiting to see the specialist so you can ask better questions. I bet you and your boy will be fine. Take care, Annette""I feel you should always see the doctor in person for any new or different pain. Take care, Annette""I have not heard of any problems with Adderall and opioids. Other folks with FMS use both. Perhaps you are one of those folks for whom opioids do not work well, or maybe they just don<APO>t work for the type of pain you are presently having, maybe it is just oxymorphone and not other opioids. I would work with your doctor and discuss this with him and with your pharmacist and see what else they can try. Take care, Annette""I know you are feeling bad right now. I responded to your previous post about pregnancy and pain meds. All drugs have maximum dosages so the analogy to BP meds is not accurate. When you get to the top dose, they try you on something else or add another BP drug to the first one. I have a friend on several (3 at last count) BP meds and her BP is still not in normal limits. Every illness has pros and cons. Take care, Annette""Thank you for your military service! I know the sacrifice that it involves because my son was an active duty Marinefor eight years. Why aren<APO>t you getting VA care for your injury, it sounds like it was related to the time you were injured during your service. My son is 90% disabled due to many different things, and he gets fairly decent medical care through the VA. Take care, Annette""If your original pain is gone or under control some other way, and this is what you want to do, just tell your doctor. He will know the best way for you to taper down since he knows your dose and history already. If you have not found a cure for your original pain, then ask your doctor if you can try lowering your opioid dose and see what happens and if he will readjust it if needed later in this process. Ask for other treatment options for any pain you continue to have. Take care, Annette""I would just be glad that you tolerate pain well. Pain is a personal, physical and emotional experience, different for everyone. Any pain that is relieved by a massage is probably musculoskeletal and a good excuse to have that boyfriend of yours rub your back! Kidney pain, like from an infection does not go away with massage. If you ever get that, go to the doctor and be evaluated, same if this pain gets worse. Small kids react differently to pain, it is just the way we are all built. I am a retired RN, I used to work in the ER and took care of all manner of children, all different in how they reacted to pain. My son had stitches in his chin twice as a kid, and didn<APO>t cry either time. Women commonly take ibuprofen or even a vicodin occasionally for mentrual pain, but discuss this with your own doctor. Ask your doctor next time you get some vicodin any questions you have about pain. If you are taking someone else<APO>s vicodin or taking old RXs for pain other than it was prescribed for, ask your doctor first. Those practices are not good ones. Take care, Annette""I agree with Beth, go to the doctor and explain your pain, your medical history, and ask for a test for kidney/bladder infection. Then you know one way or the other, and don<APO>t have to worry. Take care, Annette""I disagree. Tolerance may happen sooner or later, but I would far prefer later. The longer I can go on the same dose of opiates the better for my body and the happier my doctor will be. All of my doctors over the ten or fifteen years I have been on daily opiates have told me that long acting opiates cause tolerance to develop more slowly than the immediate release opiates do. I have read the same in a number of research articles. (All doctors I have known are aware of tolerance developing with opiates.) If they were incorrect, I would like to know where to find that info. Take care, Annette""Vicoprofen contains hydrocodone and ibuprofen rather than the acetaminophen that hydrocodone is also commonly mixed with. The opiate is the same. I suspect that any increased relief you felt was due to the anti-inflammatory effect of the ibuprofen, or just a better analgesic effect for your body from the ibuprofen. It is great that it was helpful for you. I am a believer in rotating opiates to take advantage of the partial cross tolerance between opiates. Anything that decreases the amount of tolerance we develop is a good thing. Take care, Annette""I have never had a pain med take away all the pain I felt. I am aware of my pain and how the different things I might do can increase it considerably. I have had motorcycles off and on for 40 years (off now). I would never, ever ride a motorcycle while on pain meds, let alone dump it, get someone else to lift it off of me, and get back on it and ride away. Warm, beautiful days always make me want to ride motorcycles and/or horses, but I know that with my present medical conditions that would be just dumb. I know THAT whether I am on or off of pain meds. I am glad you survived your adventure. Take care, Annette""I would just tell him they are no longer working for you. He may increase the dose or frequency, or order something different. I think you should always tell a doctor why you want to change a med, how can he do right by you if you with hold information that would be helpful to him? Take care, Annette""The research I have read always said that people using the long acting drugs were less liable to develop tolerance than those using fast acting drugs. I am curious, do you recall where you got the info that says fast acting drugs cause less chance of tolerance/addiction? Take care, Annette""You might discuss with your doctor neurontin and Lidoderm patches. Both are helpful for the pain of Shingles and post herpetic neuralgia. Lidoderm patches can only be used on intact skin I think, but check with your pharmacist. It usually passes but it might take a couple of months. Take care, Annette""It may take awhile to get the optimum level of neurontin in your system, but doctors usually give one opiates to manage the pain at the beginning of the illness. Symptoms can last a very long time, so I feel it would be best to get started right away. That is what I would choose to do. Neurontin is one of the drugs that was specifically tested on Shingles and found to work. Many doctors I know start it at the beginning of the outbreak, and discontinue it when it is no longer needed. It is not difficult to taper off of. Lidoderm patches have also been tested for Shingles in double blind studies and found to be useful, but should be used on intact skin. I have used them successfully for other types of pain. I have not heard that Lidoderm could ""aggrevate the symptoms associated subdermally with Shingles"". Where can I read about that? Take care, Annette""I am SO glad you are on the upswing. I really believe that taking an antiviral early on is a good thing. Be sure and call your doctor right away if you have any further outbreaks so you can start on it again immediately. I have heard from folks with this illness that one can feel the tingling even before the skin breaks out and itches or hurts. I am so happy for you! Take care, Annette""Keep mind that the addiction rate is very low, less than 1% according to medical research. This is something to be aware of but not scared of. Take care, Annette""I hope you have stopped wrestling, at least for now. Go to your family doctor and ask for a referral to a pain management specialist. There are lots of things to try short of opiates for muscle spasms. I have terrible DDD in my neck, I am so glad the rest of my spine is okay. If at some point you and the doctor decide opiates are the way to go, you will already have tried the other stuff. If any doctor suggests injections or other procedures ask him for evidence based proof that they work, study it and then decide. Nothing must be done in a hurry, so don<APO>t let anyone pressure you. I would see a PM specialist that manages oral meds, oversees PT, OT, cognitive therapy, etc. in addition to doing injections and procedures. I would personally avoid PM specialists who only do injections and procedures, they are usually called interventionalists. I believe that a little bit of relief from each of several types of treatment can add up to a significant amount of relief. The ER is a bad place to go for treatment, your own doctor is much better. He will get to know you, can look at your films of your spine and examine you. Then it is hit or miss, you just keep trying different things until you find the one that works for you. It may not work forever, if it stops working, you just go back to the doctor and start again. This is usually a chronic condition, so plan on dealing with it long term. That way if it goes away, you can be happy, but if it comes back it won<APO>t seem like the end of the world. It isn<APO>t. Take care, Annette""I totally agree regarding chiroprators for the neck part of the spine. My husband<APO>s chiropractor told me to never let a chiropractor near my neck after taking a look at my spinal MRI. A nurse friend of mine had a stroke while having an adjustment and left the chiro<APO>s office in an ambulance going to the hospital. It took her three years to recover the use of the affected side of her body. I have since read medical journal articles that say the vertebral arteries can be torn during an adjustment and bleed up into the head. Take care, Annette""Chiropractors, neuro or otherwise, do not write any prescriptions for medications at all that I am aware of. They aren<APO>t being difficult, it is illegal. Take care, Annette""I would not make generalizations about older doctors just because you had a bad experience with one. I think that just means maybe avoid that one doctor in the future. I think there are pros and cons to seeing younger doctors, and older doctors. I personally would evaluate each doctor based on what I am looking for. You might love a doctor I would hate, and vice versa. I did a real search for a good orthopedic surgeon for my nephew and later for my hubby. The surgeon my nephew went to died before my husband had his surgery to replace his hip. He was really old, but also really good at his craft. He was not burned out and his patients did not frequently get infections. My husband liked him fine and was sad when he died, his next in command at the clinic ended up doing my husbands THR. He was in his late 50s or 60s. He did fine. It was at a teaching hospital, I was not impressed with the young resident working with him. He will probably end up a fine young doctor, but he still had a lot to learn. We all have our own preferences. Take care, Annette""Telling your employer that you will kill yourself and your widowed husband will sue them is only likely to convince the employer that you are not capable to doing your job. It really does not matter who if anyone was at fault, you are what you are at this point in time. I don<APO>t know if your physical condition means you cannot work or not. I do recognize in you the way I felt when I stopped working about 12 years ago. That passes, you do find other reasons to carry on. How about grandkids someday, or just to spare your spouse the agony of watching you die and dealing with all of that? I found volunteer work to be very useful, for me and for the folks I was helping. Call your doctor and show him this post when you go in to see him. Let him know just how you feel so he can help you find help. Take care, Annette""I disagree about discussing your health issues with your boss or employer. The federal law says we do not have to discuss any medical issues with them. Looking back, I would not. Take care, Annette""I grew up in Calif. which has some of the best employee laws anywhere, but once I moved away, I discovered how little the other states seem to care about employees. Everywhere I have lived since had the same kind of laws you mentioned in SC and NC. They call them ""right to work"" laws, I always called them ""right to fire you"" laws. Any little reason is enough to let you go, or NO reason at all. My husband had a history of lymphoma in remission for five years, and he told his boss in Nevada that he had had chest pains and his doctor said he needed to go in for an MRI of his chest, just to be certain it wasn<APO>t back again. He was fired the next day, they didn<APO>t even wait for the results to come back. (They were negative by the way, it has been gone over 20 years now.) The company was self insured and they just did not want to risk having an employee with a lot of medical bills. I would not recommend sharing anymore than is required by law with anyone related to work anymore. Just me. Take care, Annette""He is fine, he just went and got another job. He hasn<APO>t had to deal with the cancer for over 20 years now. He recently retired after working for a company for about ten years. Thanks for the ""God Bless"". Take care, Annette""I totally agree with you Swank. I don<APO>t think people should be kept in a job that they can<APO>t physically do. However, if you can do the job, just do it, and don<APO>t share so much private info. A boss will try and guess what you might be able to do and may fire you, thinking the illness will win out, and then he might turn out to be wrong. It goes both ways. Take care, Annette""Not all places have short term disability, but I agree that might be the answer in this case. They had short term disability in Calif., but not in Nevada or Oregon. Those are the only places where I have lived. In Calif, if you had surgery or just were sick (you paid into it while you worked) you received disability insurance payments while you weren<APO>t working, and did not have to worry about the $$ while you were recovering. I think you could also use it if you had a baby. I think it maxed out at 2-3 months. I remember we had to get authorization from our doctor. Take care, Annette""So the problem is really the other secretary at work, and the interpersonal stuff that goes on all the time? As long as you do a great job and are there to do your job, your boss will get it. When you are gone enough that it really puts your co-workers on the spot and they complain to the boss, you better look out. The ADA only supports disabled people who complete the essential parts of their job. If you are not there, you can<APO>t do them. I have been through some of the job craziness you are talking about, it is a drag, but it is part of many jobs. You may not say anything at work, but you have said plenty here. Alluding to committing ""suicide"" and your widower suing the company, and talking about ""A bottle of pain pills will help about now."" just makes you sound crazy to me. We all deal with chronic pain here, and some of work and some of us no longer work because we can<APO>t. I hope things work out for you. I would suggest you see a therapist to help you get through some of this stuff successfully. Take care, Annette""To all women out there, Please read the above two posts and be aware. YOU are responsible to make sure your SS taxes are paid out of your check every time you get one. If you are self employed, be sure you figure out how it works and takes care of that first. Consider what you might do if you became disabled, working outside the home is a choice, but if you choose to stay home with your kids and do not work, you will not pay into SSDI/SSI, make sure your husband gets you a long term disability policy that will work for your financial needs if one is available, make sure he keeps up the payments. If not, work enough to satisfy the requirements of the SSA. The same goes for retirement, if you are not married long enough, you may not qualify for retirement based on your husband<APO>s income. Take care, Annette""I am a bit confused, do you have cancer or do you have scar tissue in your bowel? if the gastro doc can<APO>t tell, then you need to see someone else for a second opinion. I don<APO>t think endoscopies cannot see the interior of the small bowel, I believe they use them to look in the stomach and the large bowel/colon. What else did they suggest you do for your symptoms? Take care, Annette""It is pretty common to have a car accident and not feel anything painful until the following day. You get a pretty powerful jolt of adrenaline when you have an accident, and that can mask some symptoms. Muscle aches and spasms can also not start until a day or so after the accident. It is wise to go get checked out by your doctor. I hope you feel better soon. Take care, Annette""My old rheumatologist suggested that taking a drug holiday for about 5 days would work for tolerance. He also suggested that we could just increase my dose of meds. Take care, Annette""I understood what you meant. My rheumy also said a drug holiday was one way to handle things, he also said we could just increase my dose. I agree, I think everyone should discuss with their own doctor how to deal with these things. It is fine to gather information here, but you<APO>d have to be nuts to just change your RX med dose or schedule based on what you read online. Take care, Annette""I believe they meant the gun called a 45, as in shooting oneself looked good. Take care, Annette""My rheumy many years ago told me I could do the drug holiday or he could increase my meds. He was good about giving me info then letting me decide what to do. I always opted to increase my meds. I also deal with my doctor directly, I would not consider changing my meds based on what I read on line. Take care, Annette""Hi, Charles Always good to see you. I was just telling everyone what my rheumatologist told me. I opted to not take the drug holiday and he was more than willing to just increase my current meds. Having worked in heroin addiction treatment many years ago, it did not take more than five days clean for those folks to overdose if they took the amount of heroin they had last used. There are far too many variables to make any opinion based on that, but it is something to think about. That was just my experience with them, not with legal drugs and pain management. I would love to read any medical studies on that whole topic if you have any links handy. I have also read in peer reviewed journals that tolerance is a poorly defined and studied phenomenon, and the author of that article felt that usually increased pain was due to changes in the disease process rather than tolerance to the opioids taken for pain. Tolerance varies so much from person to person, I am not sure exactly what it is, or if it actually exists. I know what people say it is, I do read. I am just not sure what I really believe. Take care, Annette""Yep, that is Charles. He is a great guy, and has given us all a lot of info over the years. I hope he will be back more often now. Hugs, Annette""This was suspected in early testing, but I don<APO>t think it played out that way after the testing was complete. I have not read that it was very dangerous, just that it didn<APO>t work. Take care, Annette""I agree, I think it is far better to stick to one drug than add a second one as long as your doctor is willing to increase the dose. Discuss this with your doctor, including all your concerns. I am not convinced that an increase in pain meds like morphine is bad for your body, compared to adding a second drug. Take care, Annette""Yes, it is covered by Medicare on my part D plan. You would have to check with your plan to see if it is covered. Each plan has their own formulary of drugs that are covered. Take care, Annette""Marinol is not illegal in the US. It is a RX drug that contains THC taken in pill form, approved by the FDA for nausea from chemo. But it is also used off label for pain, some people use it successfully, others do not. Medical marijuana is not legal in all states, is that what you were thinking of? Take care, Annette""As far as I know anyone with an MD or a DO can prescribe it, even an RN who has prescribing privileges. You don<APO>t need to see a Pain Management doc. Good luck. Take care, Annette""There is a difference between Marinol and legal or illegal marijuana. Marinol is a pill made by a pharmaceutical company, it is legal with a RX in all states. I have never used Marinol myself. I tried marijuana (inhaled and ingested) years ago, and it did not work for me for pain. I can<APO>t speak for everyone else. I live in a state that has medical marijuana laws. Take care, Annette""Yes, you should go to the doctor. Anything that makes it that hard to swallow, could be serious. Check out the free or low cost clinics in your area. See my post above to the person with pain in his gluteal muscle who could not afford to see a doctor about how to find one. Take care, Annette""I would visit the migraine community here at WebMD. The folks there may have many comments. Were you taking the fentanyl for headaches or for something else? I use neurontin for FMS pain, but found my migraines decreased in severity and frequency after starting it. I use Reglan 10 mg. along with aspirin 675 mg. or ibuprofen 800 mg when I do get a headache. I alternate that with compazine 10 mg. so that I don<APO>t use anything too frequently. I do not want to end up with rebound headaches. All people with migraines have to just keep trying different things until they find the combination of meds that works for them. Discuss these things with your doctor, if he can<APO>t help you, ask him to refer you to someone who can. Take care, Annette""Imitrex and the other ""triptan"" type drugs are very useful. I have found that no med works 100% of the time, Imitrex worked about 75% of the time for me, so it was always good to have other rescue meds available and on hand, just in case. I found the reglan/aspirin combo to actually work more often for me than the Imitrex did, and it is dirt cheap. By keeping all three on hand, I have always been able to get rid of a headache. It is okay with my doctor for me to take all three on the same day if need be. No interactions. I do remember when Imitrex first came out, it was really a wonder drug. I didn<APO>t have to miss work as it did not make me sleepy like the opiates did that they usually gave before that. Take care, Annette""You do need to go see a doctor for an evaluation. Check out the free/low cost clinics in your area. They are available in many cities, I used to volunteer in one. Check out Google or any good search engine. Type ""free or low cost clinic in (the name of your town)"" and see what comes up. You can also call Goodwill, Salvation Army, or Catholic Charities. If the pain went away in a matter of minutes after taking the ibuprofen, it may not have been the medicine that helped. I don<APO>t think it works that fast. It has to dissolve and be absorbed into your system. Your body also generally does not develop a tolerance to ibuprofen. Take care, Annette""I live in Oregon, just south of the state line. I have not heard of this before. Oxycodone is certainly not the only opiate that works. There are other opiates they can prescribe in the ER that work fine for pain. I know they have talked about many things in Washington as they have in other states, but I am unaware that any laws have been passed yet, so anyone who has a problem should get politically active and not just complain about it on message boards. I know when I worked in ERs in Calif. many years ago (over 20) they required a triplicate form for oxycodone, so few doctors prescribed it, certainly rarely if ever, in the ER. As I have moved around from state to state, I have found geographical differences in prescribing, different drugs are used in different areas (not just opiates, all kinds of drugs). Not all states require triplicate RXs, they don<APO>t here in Oregon so doctors don<APO>t seem to care as much as they did in states that did require them. The rate of abuse of all kinds of RX drugs has increased dramatically over the last decade or so, it is not just heroin or cocaine anymore that are abused. Most users end up dealing at some level during their addiction. Addiction is a terrible thing, there are few successful treatments, and not enough treatment facilities available. I am glad I have chronic pain and not addiction. Take care, Annette""I have a different set of experiences than some of the other folk here. My state requires consultation by a PM doctor or some other appropriate specialist if your family doc is going to use opiates for chronic non-malignant pain. I have seen two PM specialists over the last 15 years or so for consultations, and both agreed with my family doctor that opiates were appropriate for me. They wrote the letters for my file and it was no big deal. The last time, I worried because of what I read on line and none of it came true. A waste of energy. Take care, Annette""I would just explain that hydrocodone has not worked for you in the past. I would not suggest oxycodone (Percocet) unless you have tried it and it did work. If you are seeing a good dentist/oral surgeon I am sure he will know what kinds of drugs are available and will discuss that with you when you see him. Do not hesitate to call him if your pain management meds do not work for you at the dose he orders. Get an after hours phone number from him before you go home. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""I would find a different PM doctor, one who uses a variety of treatments, not just injections and procedures. Let him guide you about how to use the TENS unit and ultrasound, he may also be able to adjust your meds, and suggest other things for you. There are lots of other meds to try, that are not opiates, too. No one can do this without examining you properly. Take care, Annette""Talk to your doctor. There are other meds for pain that you can use along with the Humira until it begins to work better, if there are no other meds like Humira to try. Call the rheumatologist<APO>s office and ask to be put on their cancellation list, that way if someone else cancels their appt. for any reason they will call the next person on the list and see if they want the appt. Explain that you are significantly worse and ask to be seen as soon as possible. The doctor may even have a few emergency appts. that he keeps open for just such a problem. My doctor does that, and so does my husband<APO>s doctor. It is a common practice. Take care, Annette""Call the doctor make an appt. and let him examine your husband and decide if there is a problem or not. It may just be a side effect of the medicine, I don<APO>t honestly know. No one can really answer your question without examining your husband<APO>s hand. He is lucky to have you. Take care, Annette""If you need pain meds, you need pain meds. I understand not wanting to take them, and taking the least possible, but why eliminate them altogether? Take care, Annette""Don<APO>t give up, do what you think is right for you. I have chronic pain and have been on daily opioids of some kind for about 15 years now. I had breast reduction surgery 6 months ago and the reduction in my back pain was astounding. I was able to cut my long acting opioid, methadone, in half over several weeks. I slowly tapered one dose per day (I take my methadone three times a day) until I got all three reduced by half. That is fine for me, for now. I hope your back surgery goes well. Please talk to your doctor, not the surgeon, about your chronic pain and ask what to do to take the least amount of meds per day. Tell the doctor what kinds of activities you usually do at home and what you would like to be able to do that you can<APO>t do now because of the pain. I do really appreciate hearing from you. Thanks for the thank you. Take care, Annette""Hi, Kelly You can ask me anything, lol. I wore a 46 DDD cup but only because that was the largest size I could find locally. I would guess I was actually larger than that if I wore a properly fitted bra. I asked my surgeon for a C cup if possible, and she replied that she never promised a cup size after surgery. However, now I am wearing 38-40 C bras and they seem to fit well. I am probably a smaller size C, rather than a large C. All you girls out there know what I mean. I had lost about 50 pounds total over a few years, but it never made any difference in my cup size, just my band size. I was shocked also at the difference it made regarding pain. My husband rubs my back for me and he said that the tight bands across my back were completely gone. I am 60 years old, and I did it primarily for the pain reduction, although now I love my perky little breasts, lol. My pcp suggested to me that it might help. Her med. asst. had had the surgery done as a very young woman and was thrilled with her outcome. Actually, I have never met a woman who regretted having this particular surgery. Medicare helped me pay for mine as a medically necessary procedure. To pass muster with them the doctor had to remove 750 grams from each breast. She told me post op that she removed about 800 grams from each side, plus some lipo that she did. I just saw my surgeon for my six month checkup, all is well. Take care, Annette""Those are two totally different drugs. Suboxone contains buprenorphine and naloxone together in one sublingual (it dissolves under the tongue) pill. Subutex contains only buprenorphine. The buprenorphine is an opioid itself. They switch you to this substitute drug rather than taking the opioid pain pill you are on, then it is up to you and the doctor whether you will taper off of that or not. They used to do the same thing with methadone. Buprenorphine is classified as an opioid med with a class III designation. It has a high affinity to opioid receptors in the CNS, and has a partial mu agonist, and a weak kappa antagonist activity. The naloxone prevents people from abusing this drug. It is an opioid antagonist. If someone tried to dissolve this pill and shoot it up IV, the naloxone would prevent the opioid from working, and may cause withdrawal symptoms in an opiate addicted person. According to my drug book, oral naloxone should only be given to opioid addicts/alcoholics 7-10 days after they taper off of opioids, when used to prevent recurrence of active addiction. Take care, Annette""Hi, Kelly I laugh and tell my best friend that my breasts are now like her nieces<APO> at about age 25. I had the same gravity issues that you mentioned. They do an entire reconstruction when they remove tissue, so the results depend on the surgeon and what you have for her to work with. I was shooting for pain reduction, and was thrilled with the look of the whole thing after surgery, along with the pain reduction. I used a surgeon that my pcp recommended and I also checked out her website and looked at her before and after photos of all kinds of plastic surgery, but especially breast reconstructions/reductions. I also checked out the hospital that she was wanting to use and made sure they passed muster. They specialize in breasts, both esthetically, and for cancer surgery and treatment. I do suggest you do your due diligence in checking out anyone who is going to cut on your body. It was certainly a win/win thing for me. Take care, Annette""Hi, Becky Thanks for the info on what you experienced 15 years post op. There is a big difference between addiction and dependence. Addiction is the compulsive use of a drug for other than its intended purpose. So if you are using the hydrocodone to get high, rather than for pain management, then I would suggest you talk to your doctor or a good addictions specialist. I might add that most addicts move on from hydrocodone to stronger opiates is far less than ten years. Dependence means simply that your body has become used to having the hydrocodone in its system and might go through some kind of withdrawal symptoms if you stopped taking it abruptly. The same can be said of many kinds of drugs. The rate of addiction is very low among people who use their meds as prescribed by their doctors, less than 1% in the most recent article in my nursing journal. If it makes you feel better, I have been taking daily opiates for about 15 years, and near daily opiates for longer than that. I show no signs of addiction, and continue to do well on fairly low doses. Again, thanks for taking the time to post your post op breast reduction results. Take care, Annette""What were you taking 300 mg. a day of? Going down to 25 mg. a day is amazing, good for you. Take is very slowly, all the references I have read say to only reduce your daily dose by 10 percent once a week. So the next dose would be 22.5 mg. for one week, then a slight drop again. You may still have some withdrawal symptoms, but that should minimize them. Or you could just go through the withdrawals and live with them, I would suggest taking a bit of vacation time if you choose to do this. I would not recommend getting pregnant until you resolve this issue and figure out if you will be able to do your whole pregnancy without opiates at all, or if you will need to take them and you both feel the risk to the baby will be minimal. Your OB doctor should be able to discuss this with you, and maybe he can suggest alternate ways to manage pain. It sounds like you may need a high risk OB doctor to manage your pregnancy. Your pcp should be able to tell you. With your age and medication history...hard to say. My sister and my mom both had babies at age 41, don<APO>t be in such a rush that you feel it must happen ""in a week or so."" Take care, Annette""You won<APO>t come across as a drug seeker if you are asking how to taper off of the drugs. The doctor changing the dose is the first step of tapering off. He would slowly lower the dose of the opiate until you are on a very low dose, then perhaps have you take them less frequently until you don<APO>t take them at all. The thing to remember is that your old pain will probably come back so I am not sure what the point is, does it matter to you whether you are debilitated by pain or not? What side effects are you currently having from the opiates that make you want to be off of them? Take care, Annette""Personally, I do not tell people what meds I am on or how often I take them. Then they won<APO>t act any way about me being on narcotics. If you can get off of them without significant uncontrolled pain, great, but if you cannot, you cannot. Take care, Annette""Don<APO>t feel defeated. Do whatever you feel you need to do. Discuss it all with your doctors, and with a therapist if need be. Take care, Annette""I would see a gastroenterologist, or two, and get their opinions. Perhaps surgery is an option, I do not know. Take care, Annette""Talk to your pharmacist about adding any over-the-counter med to your RX meds. Take care, Annette""Just tell him that the meds are no longer working. He may change the dose, change the meds, or add something else to the mix. No reason not to be honest with the doctor, how can he take care of you properly if you aren<APO>t? Take care, Annette""Hi, Beth 20 years ago, before we got together, he had been diagnosed with stage 4, non-Hodgkin<APO>s Lymphoma. Treatment was not as advanced as it is now, and he ran through all that was available, and was given six months to live. He was considered terminal when we met. He quit all treatment, we discussed it, and he moved in with my son and I, we fully expected him to die. He got well. No medical explanation at all. He is a medical miracle. So, we have had just over 20 years of wedded bliss. Who can complain after that? Life is good. I hope you and Kevin find the same. Take care, Annette""Nothing offends me about my husband and my relationship, he is a real miracle. He had already moved in with me when we were married, but his prognosis was unknown at the time we married. They had told us he would die without treatment, which he had decided to stop and stopped already, so we were kind of waiting to see what would happen. My dad had died of lung cancer at age 46 when I was 18, so I just assumed we would go through that. I was most concerned about my 10 year old son. We discussed it with him, and he was pretty cool about it. He was willing, so we went ahead and my husband-to-be moved in with us. When he didn<APO>t die, he figured he better go back to work, so he found a job. He was a heavy truck mechanic until he retired this year. For many years it was pretty much all he could do to work a full time job and sleep a lot. He was 6<APO>3"" and weighed about 145 pounds, it took about nine years to get him back up to 185-190. He just did not like to eat at all. His cholesterol level was about 125 as he did not process fats well at all. He lost ALL his hair during chemo, so I never knew him with it. It never came back. My son had to get dead virus vaccines back then so he got the polio injections rather than the oral vaccine like his friends did. He never even complained about that, he just dealt with whatever came our way. He is a good kid. My husband-to-be asked him what he wanted to call him, he was open to whatever my son wanted. My son said ""I already have a dad, so can you be my friend?"" So they call each other by their first names. My son would introduce his step-dad as ""My friend, Rick."" to his buddies. very grownup. They have a special relationship. My son was a Marine for eight years, and my husband who had been in the Army and served in Vietnam, warned him about that ahead of time. Now they both have war memories and their own varieties of PTSD. My son always knew not to poke his step dad when he was asleep to wake him up, better to call to him from across the room. I am very lucky to have this man in my life. I hope Kevin is as good to you as my honey is to me. It is so good to hear your son came through his own near death experience as an infant. I cannot imagine that as another mom. Take care, Annette""Hi, Beth My son is married and they have a 4 year old son together, and a 16 year old from a previous relationship of hers. So, I have only the two grandsons. I could not have picked a better daughter-in-law myself, she is great. We have two rescued mutts from the animal shelters, my husband spoils them like crazy, me not so much. No cats, my husband is allergic to them. I am okay today, I volunteer Wed. from 6-7am at the animal shelter walking dogs. I actually just take them outside for a potty break in the yards provided for them. It is a good thing for me, but I hurt a lot afterwards for a couple of days. But, it is fun, so why not? Take care, Annette""Keep at the education dream. My daughter-in-law is getting her BA in Dec. I think she has been taking one or two classes a semester while working full time and taking care of her home and kids. She starts her Master<APO>s right after that at USC, I think. That one can mostly be done on line. The internship the last term is the only part she has to do in person. I am a big believer in education. You keep it up!!! Take cre, Annette""That is beautiful, Dave. My girlfriend and I built a similar sized fish pond in her new back yard a number of years ago. It was a big job, but totally worth it. Take care, Annette""Hi, I had my 60th birthday recently. My husband and I built a tool shed in the backyard on my birthday. We moved his tools last Sunday with the help of two nice young men from next door. My husband is a recently retired truck mechanic and his tools are HEAVY. Building a shed is defintiely a first for me. Always good to keep doing things you have never tried before. And, I have been learning belly dancing via DVDs and the TV Fitness Channel. I have been doing that every day (except one) since the end of April. I am up to 1 1/2 to 2 hours a day now. Great fun! I am fitter, more mobile, have lost a bit of weight, and my doctor has adjusted my meds to my new level of activity. She said, ""No one should decrease their activity level due to pain."" I had suggested staying at an hour a day, because it hurt a lot. She just changed my BT meds. Needless to say, I adore my doctor. She is great. My pain levels are acceptable for me. I spoke to my brother and my son today, both great guys. So life is good. Hugs, Annette""Hooray for Kevin. I understand the ambivalent feelings, but go for it. My husband had been given six months to live with lymphoma when he moved in with me. It has been 20 years, he got well, go figure. Hugs, Annette""The only way to know if you broke a rib is to see a doctor and get a chest xray. My mom hugged my dad from behind while they were spooning in bed and broke his rib, lol. His doctor said that was not uncommon at all, and laughed. He said if you use just the right angle it doesn<APO>t take that much force. He broke another rib teaching my little brother to ride his bike, he just fell off, not a big deal. But very painful. Take care, Annette""If his PCP cannot help him control the pain then he needs to see a specialist who can. Just ask his doctor where to go next. Take care, Annette""Maybe a different doctor? All doctors are different, just like we are. Take care, Annette""That depends on your insurance coverage. Check with your insurance company to see if you need a referral or not. I have old fashioned Medicare, so I don<APO>t need a referral. I would also talk to the PM doctor<APO>s office staff when you call to make an appt. Ask the usual questions that you need to ask for any doctor to make sure you are a good fit. I would also ask if they practice primarily interventional pain management (mostly injections and procedures), or if they also offer other modalities. You want to make sure they even offer what you are looking for. That first step might be to discuss this with your pcp and ask him/her for referrals to other doctors that he is used to working with and would be on the same page as him. The only bad question is the one that is not asked. If you ever read back a bit and do not find the answer to a question you have, feel free to ask away. That is the only way to learn things. Take care, Annette""You need to see an MD and have this injury evaluated. He can examine you and your two can figure out the best plan of action. Take care, Annette""Although I am not a Christian, I have no problem with someone offering up prayers and stating they have done so briefly at this board. However, if you want to go into quoting specifically Christian Scripture, etc. you might consider going to a prayer and spirituality board, or a specifically Christian board. There are people of other faiths or no faith at all that visit here. Just be sensitive to their feelings too. Take care, Annette""Please do take good care of yourself, or you will break down. No one is strong enough to be a caregiver forever without respite. Can those siblings of his who are traveling the world and having such full and wonderful lives come home and give you a break once in a while by helping to care for their brother? Also if he is mentioning suicide, even obliquely, he needs to be talking to some kind of licensed therapist. Talking to your mom, is not enough, no matter how good she is. He knows talking to you about that would upset you, he needs someone safe to talk to about such feelings. I am glad that prayer of any kind is soothing to you, but remember, ""God helps those who help themselves."" Keep at it, as you have been doing. He is lucky to have you. Take care, Annette""I am glad to hear he is seeing a psychologist, unfortunately often the first sign a family sees of this kind of depression is a suicide attempt. People are very good at hiding these things from their family, they do not want them to hurt any more than they do already. If it is a good psychologist he should not be sharing what Chris says to him with other members of the family without Chris<APO> permission. Please do make time for other diversions for yourself, whether it is a hobby or volunteer work at your church, whatever gives you pleasure and gets you out of the house. Caregivers really need respite from their work. As you know it is never-ending, you don<APO>t have days off from being a mom. Of course you need spiritual support. I just wanted to remind folks here that there are non-Christians who also post here, and to be sensitive to them also. Take care (of yourself, lol), Annette""Hi, Reddogg, That was me that posted about prayers, etc. I have no problem with posting that you are praying for someone, I think that is a kind thing to do. However, I do not bother to read the really long posts that quote Christian Scriptures, and some might be put off by them and look elsewhere for medically related help. I think there are other places that might be more appropriate for the Christian stuff. I am only one person here, I do not make the rules. This is only my opinion. Everyone should do exactly as they think is right of course. Take care, Annette""Thanks, Red Dog. It is very kind of you to say such nice things. Your posts are very helpful and kind to everyone. Take care, Annette""Hi, Mary How are YOU doing? Are you holding up okay? I know it is cumbersome, but I have my pcp write ALL my RXs. If a specialist feels I need something, I would ask them to fax my pcp their recommendation, then she and I would discuss it and decide what to do. But, she would write the RX. As an old nurse, I just feel this is safer, and for now anyway, it works for us. Take care, Annette""I have also found that actually writing things down is helpful. My memory is not what it used to be. When my husband had a work injury and required lengthy medical attention and then hip replacement surgery, I kept what looks like a regular medical record. One binder was for medical info and appts. The first page was just a list of all the doctors names, specialty areas, addresses, and phone numbers, insurance company<APO>s customer service number, etc. (I made a copy of this for all the binders I kept just to save time looking for addresses and phone numbers.) The second page was for appts. I wrote them in chronological order and crossed them off as we went to them. The third page was an up to date list of his meds, treatments, dressings, etc. Then I kept copious notes from each appt. with our concerns, the doctor<APO>s responses, and final instructions for that appt. including follow up appts. He was also seeing a wound care nurse, so I added notes from those appts. also. The second binder was for the financial, insurance part of it all. I put the billing from the doctor<APO>s offices, the insurance EOBs, and finally our payment to the doctors for our part of the bill. I matched up them all to make sure they were all getting paid. This kind of record keeping seems like a near full time job, but it was worth it in the long run as it made checking things pretty easy. All the energy is in setting it up to start out with. I guess in your case, I would also keep a current care plan including his up to date med list and hand a copy to each doctor at the beginning of the appt. The other list to hand the doctor at the beginning of the appt. is your concerns for that particular doctor to address that day. I am a retired RN, and my husband was happy to let me be in charge of all this record keeping, I do not know how you and Chris manage these things. I went to most of his appts. with him, and I was the note taker, but you and Chris have to decide what your boundaries are and how involved he wants you to be. This is just the way we handled it, you have to work out what is the best way for you and Chris to deal with it. Be sure to make time for you to do things for yourself, otherwise you will burn out faster than you want to. Whether it is having your nails done or just going for a walk in the park. DO IT!!! Take care, Annette""Hi, Mary The puppy sounds great. We have two dogs that we got from the SPCA and from the county shelter where I volunteer now. I adore them. They do keep you up and moving for sure. One of mine is smart as a tack, he has learned all kinds of tricks, the other one took three months to learn to sit, lol. But, she is smart in other ways, at least that is what I say. Take care of yourself!!! Hugs, Annette""Hi, Beth We are all fine. My dear DIL was just accepted to USC<APO>s Master<APO>s program in social work with an emphasis on veterans<APO> issues. My son is a former combat Marine, so she has personal experience, they like that. We are all so excited for her. They live in southern Calif., we are up here in northern Oregon. I am so happy we both have computers to keep in touch with. I will go visit for a couple of weeks over Xmas as usual. Hope all is well with you and yours. Hugs, Annette""No, I am not one of those southern, steel magnoias, lol. I was raised in northern Calif. just north of San Francisco, and now live outside of Portland, OR. I do love northern Calif, and Oregon. Sorry about the reference to USC, I meant the University of Southern Calif. My hubby is a UCLA grad, and there is a constant UCLA/USC competition as you know if you lived in LA. I am very proud of her. Hugs, Annette""I have participated in message boards where people who were not Christian were basically run off because they were of other beliefs, Jewish or Pagan, for instance. People left. This has not happened on this board, but has on another WebMD Board where I was a member. I just do not want it to happen here. There was a post on this thread that was quoting a lot of Scripture from the Bible. I didn<APO>t read the entire thing, because frankly, I come here for medical information. I really don<APO>t care if you offer a prayer for someone, just don<APO>t push the ""Christian"", ""Jewish"", ""Muslim"", etc. religious stuff on folks. So far only Christians have done that, that I have seen. There is a prayer and spirituality board for those kinds of posts. I don<APO>t really want strangers praying for me. I don<APO>t feel it is necessary or helpful. I think God will do right by everyone without any reminders from us. If you want to pray, go ahead. But it seems like one should pray to God, not broadcast it on line. That is my opinion. Others disagree. We are all entitled to our own opinions as long as we follow the rules here. Take care, Annette""Well said. I should have read your post before I responded. I could have just said ""Ditto what Beth said."" Hugs, Annette""I am so glad that you posted again, it is always good to hear how someone is doing later on. I have never had RFA so I can<APO>t tell you anything from personal experience. All I can say is that for every procedure, the mental/emotional side of things is very important, so I would say that Chris should read more and wait until he is ready, if ever, for this procedure. He should read evidence based studies that discuss possible adverse effects as well as good effects. He might ask this doctor for links on line to confirm that this is the way to go for him with his condition. He should be sure that the studies were for a condition similar to his and done properly. Take care, Annette""Lots of doctors have lousy bedside manner, with the way our insurance is these days, you get what you can. Maybe when Chris and he get to know one another better, he will be more cordial. The other thing is that your son, like mine, is of an age where he is in charge of what he decides. On one hand I wish mine were young enough for me to make all his medical decisions for him, but the rest of me knows he has to do this for himself. Take care, Annette""I would not recommend suffering for a couple of months, I would be very honest with her.Treat the pain just as you would any other symptom. I would also suggest keeping a pain journal, at least until you have good relief. Write in what time and the dose of any meds that you take. Score your pain on a 0-10 scale a couple of hours after taking pain meds, and at least three times a day. Write in other things that you do for pain, like ice packs, hot soaks, exercise, stretching, etc. That way she will know you are trying other things too. Take care, Annette""It should say on the RX bottle how many pills to take and how many times per day. Take care, Annette""That is a good idea. I would keep the journal and then just be honest with your new doc, and do not take anything she has not prescribed. Honesty is really all you can do, and the best policy anyway. Take care, Annette""Switch to a different pain med. It may be a hassle, but it may also be the best thing for you to do for you. There are lots of different ones to try, and as long as you adjust the dose properly, I really do not believe that any one is better than another. Don<APO>t get hung up on the numbers of mgs. of a drug that you use, go by the effect you get from the dose. Lots of side effects go away after a few weeks. Constipation is the only one that seems to hang on, but you can deal with that. Lawyers always want class action suits, they make ALOT of money with those, but the people in the class end up with very little. I would get out of that for now. Wait and see how you do. Best of luck. Take care, Annette""That is about all there is over the counter. You will have to talk to your doctor, explain that you want to wait to see the specialist until the end of the semester. He may or may not be willing to help you out. If he feels it is important that you see the specialist right away, he may not give you anything for pain. If he feels it is okay to wait a bit, he may give you something. Take care, Annette""I would take all your pills to your doctor with you and tell him that you don<APO>t think they are helping you. Discuss with him how to best change, discontinue or adjust your meds<APO> doses and scheduling so that you have better relief. Take care, Annette PS, There is no one pill a day that will take care of all your symptoms, that I am aware of.""The meds they gave you are a common migraine treatment. I use reglan 10 mg. orally with aspirin or ibuprofen at home for migraines. Saves a trip to the ER. I take it the minute any symptoms start. I am sure you will be okay, the point is to be okay and in as little pain as possible, lol. Please talk to your doctor before stopping or changing any medicine. Take care, Annette""To be honest, I have never had that kind of treatment by any doctor. I am also 60 years old and a chronic pain patient. I would not want to stay in their practice, I would opt out myself first. Good luck to you. Take care, Annette""I really agree with Beth about interviewing doctors prior to becoming their patients officially. I have done this for years, and maybe that is why I have had pretty good luck with doctors once I become their patients. I am sure to ask them how they like phone calls to deal with problems, I prefer to see them in person myself. I also ask how they handle emergent patients, do they have 2-3 office visits open daily in case someone needs to be seen right away, and not next month. I ask how they like it that I do my own research on-line and what kind of sites they prefer for my health issues. I ask how many patients they have with my issues to make sure they have some skill base dealing with them. I ask what hospitals they work at, and how they deal with hospitalized patients. My current doctor is about 35 minutes away, and no longer works at the hospital near me. We have a plan just in case, but I really have no reason to go into the hospital now. Ask about any personal preferences that you have before you sign on with them. Take care, Annette""As nurses we have probably been lucky at times, because other nurses always know the best doctors to go to. However, 12 years ago I found myself moving out of state and no longer working as a nurse, so I did not have professional connections anymore. Personal references are the best as far as I am concerned. Now that I have a great pcp, I ask her for suggestions for other specialists. So far, so good. Take care, Annette""I would not take a pill that was prescribed for something else on a regular basis. Go see your doctor and let him/her examine you properly. Take care, Annette""Duh, that is why they make them in the OP formulation now. So folks who used to break the tablets, no longer have a good reason to do so. You are not prescribed by your doctor to be breaking the tablet in any way at all. They are prescribed to be taken whole and never chewed or split. This is a Pain Management Forum not a forum on how to use your opiate meds incorrectly, and illegally. Take care, Annette""Of course it is illegal, it is trafficking in drugs, and you would then have RX pills for which you have no legal RX. The OPs are a different preparation than the OCs that you have a RX for. Whether they are the same drug has nothing to do with it. You should not be breaking your own Oxycontins in half, EVER. The pharmacy insert tells you that. On the older Oxycontins that disrupts the extended action and dumps all the drug into your system at once. Your doctor has surely left someone in charge of his practice while he is gone, make an appt. and go see that person. Take care, Annette""I would just talk to your doctor about this if it continues, and see what he says. If you don<APO>t have the pain every time you take the pill, but only ""every now and then"" it may not even be related to the pill. Keep a symptom journal andshow it to your doctor. Be sure and write the exact times you take all your pills, and the times the symptoms start and go away. Take care, Annette""I am so glad you are still working this out with your doctor. Better than to just give up and be stuck in the house. Take care, Annette""Thanks, Beth. I totally agree with you about finding the right doctor/team to work with for any chronic medical condition. It is well worth the effort. Hugs, Annette""Wow, Trudy, you have been through a lot. It is so good to have you posting here. I have read a bunch of your posts and you seem to be right on point. Lots of good advice. Take care, Annette""I am pretty sure you are talking to Beth, not me. I live in Oregon, she lives in CT. Take care, Annette PS, Best of luck with your coming procedure.""Go see a doctor in person so he can examine you properly. Take care, Annette""What is causing the pain? What causes the left leg to be longer than the right? I would want to know the ""whys"", otherwise it would seem the orthotic would fix the problem. I would also avoid the chiropractors for now and see an MD who is an orthopedic specialist. Take care, Annette""Sciatica is pain along the sciatic nerve usually caused by some kind of inflammation. It would not cause your leg to be shorter or longer than the other one. I think you need to see an MD to get to the bottom of your pain problems. Take care, Annette""We are doing okay. My little grandson is doing great. His big brother had to soak his foot for an ingrown toenail surgery he had, and the little one went and got bowl of water and sat down next to him and soaked his own foot too, lol. He is a sweetheart. We are both lucky to have grandkids aren<APO>t we? I have one of those heel spurs too, I have never had any problems with it, it showed up on an xray I had once when I sprained my ankle. Is your problem in your big toes related to gout or is it just straight arthritis? Gout or gouty arthritis is treated with meds and often flares up every now and then. Plain arthritis can also be treated with meds, or if it is severe they can do surgery on the joints involved. I agree that I would see a podiatrist or an ortho foot specialist, but definitely someone who specializes in feet. Let me know what comes up. Take care, Annette""I know a number of people who have had surgery on their toes for arthritis and had very good results. Both for pain and mobility. Hope it goes well. Take care, Annette""I agree, get her to her own pcp. ERs are not as good at diagnosing a problem beyond making very sure someone is not dying. She needs to see her own doctor, many things can cause abdominal pain in women. Take care, Annette""I would talk to your doctor about genetic testing. I believe I have read somewhere that certain people are genetically different and respond to opiates differently than other people. I would ask to find out about this now, not when you need the meds. Take care, Annette""I think it is worthwhile to at least talk to your doctor about it. Far better to know now, than after you need it and you hurt unnecessarily. Let me know how it goes for you. Take care, Annette""Most communities have free of discount medical clinics, but you have to search for them, they seldom pay to advertise. You can Google ""free medical clinic in your home town"" and see if anything pops up. You can also call Goodwill, Salvation Army, and Catholic Charities and ask them what they know about where you live. Your county health department may also be able to help you either with applying for Medicaid or telling you what is available where you live. My county actually has primary health care clinics, you may end up on a waiting list, but once you get in, you stay in as long as you need them. They have different eligibility requirements than Medicaid so often even folks who are working qualify. I do feel this warrants seeing a doctor about if possible. If it goes away before you find one, at least look around now so you know where you can go next time. Take care, Annette""That is good that the ER doctor was able to diagnose your problem once the hand swelled up. Often it takes time and the development of further symptoms to make a diagnosis. I am glad that things are improving for you. Take care, Annette""Part if it might be that you are 52 and can no longer work like a 20 year old. It sounds like your job is very physical. I don<APO>t know exactly what your MRI showed, other than you said the neurosurgeon said it was nothing surgical. You could still have enough wear and tear on your spine to cause you pain. I would start trying the adjuvant medications like antidepressants, seizure meds, etc. See if they help. If not you can still try the opiates, they come with acetaminophen to start with, like the vicodin you have already taken. There are many stronger opiates available. Many people take a cocktail of several different drugs and get their lives back as far as function goes. I would see a pain management specialist who is not an interventionalist, but rather someone who uses a variety of treatment modalities including oral meds, acupuncture, PT, OT, biofeedback, TENS, etc. in addition to the injections and procedures it seems like you have already had. Some PM doctors only do injections and procedures because they make more money per visit that way and do not have to deal with drug abusers every day. Take care, Annette""I recently changed my BT med from Norco to oxycontin/APAP 10/32, I have noticed a small increase in relief. Good enough for me. That said, not everyone does. My brother used Percocet for pain from a tooth extraction and it did no good at all, but Vicoden did work well for him. Everyone is different, talk to your doctor and let him know how you are doing. Take care, Annette""Norco is a short acting opiate, and there is a thought born by some research, I think, that short acting opiates will be more likely to cause tolerance than long acting opiates. Usually once a person is on daily opiate therapy for a few months, the doctor wants to try the long acting opiates and use the short acting ones for breakthrough pain only. I don<APO>t know what side effects you had, or how long you tried to stick it out so it is hard to even suggest things to talk to your doctor about. Most side effects from opiates, except constipation, are transitory and go away after a few weeks or with adjusting the dosage. Nucynta is a completely different drug than the opiates so it has its own set of pros and cons. It is too new for me, I won<APO>t try new drugs until they have been on the market and widely prescribed for at least 5 years. That is when you really see what the side effect profile is. Take care, Annette""See the rheumy, take your records with you so they don<APO>t repeat anything you have already tried. Your pcp pretty much did the standard thing as far as drugs go. Started with NSAIDs and acetaminophen, and muscle relaxants, and worked up from there. I don<APO>t know how abnormal your liver function tests were, or how they were abnormal, but it may be that tylenol is not the best drug for you. She obviously does not feel comfortable prescribing opiates, so perhaps the rheumy will be. I have had good luck with rheumatologists for the most part. Take care, Annette""Don<APO>t get your hopes up. I did not find it was any faster to use their new email format than it was to just come to the site and go through the posts myself. Too darn long!! Oh well, yet another new and not improved WebMD idea. Not your fault, Caprice. Take care, Annette""I checked out the ""email digests are back"" threads on four different boards and still have not found a positive post by someone who used and liked them in the new format. Hugs, Annette""Hi, John Charles posted just a couple of days ago. Hopefully, now that the email digests are back he will visit more often. I know he liked them before. He is very up to date on info and usually has links to interesting articles. Take care, Annette""Charles said he might come back if they got the email digests back again, I hope he at least tries them out. Other than that we only see him once in a while now. Dr. Maine is a good addition to this group, perhaps that will draw Charles back into the fold. Take care, Annette""Hi, Gail That is just my opinion, you should give them a try and see if they work for you. There is a place on the left hand side column that you click on, and it is easy to do. You will always be a part of this community as far as I am concerned. Take care of yourself. Hugs, Annette""Hi, Caprice I have not seen anyone reply favorably on the email digests in this thread. I guess the people who like them must be saying so elsewhere. Hugs, Annette""Please let your doctor know about this itching. My cousin died from a type of lymphoma that is very rare and causes severe itching. He and his doctor ignored his itching for many years because they didn<APO>t understand it and he was willing to let it go. I really doubt you have this disease, but itching to the point of getting a callous there is not normal either. Take care, Annette""The makers of tramadol state pretty clearly that one should not take more than 400 mg. per day, so taking 150 mg. more than twice a day would put oyu over that amount. The instructions given in my drug book say that for methocarbamol one should take up to 1500 mg. four times per day for 2-3 days, then to decrease to 4000-4500 mg per day in 3-6 divided doses. These are the instructions for oral medication for muscle spasm. Up to 8000 mg. per day can be used in severe conditions. My personal feeling is that if these doses do not work, it is better to find a different drug that does work at recommended doses. Ask your pharmacist for the package inserts or printed information about these drugs and take them to the doctor to discuss if you remain concerned. Take care, Annette""I had similar pain, from FMS though, like a really bad sunburn to the backs of my thighs and knees. My doc gave me neurontin along with my opiates. That seemed to work fairly well. I think I also recall using Lidoderm patches which also helped me through the worst of it. Lyrica is a second generation drug, very similar to neurontin. It really didn<APO>t help me much, so I went back to neurontin. Take care, Annette""I am happy to hear that the SCS is working so well for you. Once someone is painfree, I can sure understand that they are not bothering to read and post here anymore. Life is too busy, lol. Take care, Annette""There is no way to tell without a doctor examining you what may have caused this pain. If you had no pain with the insertion, flushing, or removal of the IV catheter, I would be hard pressed to blame it on that. It could just be coincidental. Take care, Annette""I use zolpidem (Ambien) for sleep. I also take methadone for pain. Neurontin helps too. Those three seem to be the answer for me right now. I take all the neurontin in one dose near bedtime. I may not get as good restoritive sleep as I used to before I became ill, but it is better than not sleeping at all. I get about 6-7 solid hours, then doze of and on for another couple of hours. I do wake up enough to turn over about every 3-4 hours. My pain levels are just crazy if I don<APO>t sleep at all. I also get in my little hot tub just before bedtime. I occasionally feel like skipping that and just going to bed, but I have learned not to even try that. I wake up SO stiff anf sore that it is just not worth it. Don<APO>t worry about being negative, maybe one of us will suggest something useful. Your turn will come and you will offer advice to someone else about what has worked for you. If I remember correctly, your father is an alcoholic??? Try to disconnect to a certain point, he is responsible for his own choices, as you are for yours. You cannot take on guilt for his trips. An alcoholic is in a different reality than we are, try not to judge him too harshly. Take care, Annette""Hey, Beth One of the things that works for me when nothing else seems to help with the pain is to have my hubby rub my feet. Perhaps you and your daughter could give that a try. I swear that the reason it works is because your brain cannot process two different sensations at once, so it accepts the foot rubbing rather than the pain. Heck, I don<APO>t know if it is true or not, but it is soothing and it seems to work for me. I often am able to drift off to sleep. I don<APO>t tell people what meds I take either, it is just none of their business anyway, why deal with their BS. Hugs, Annette""Hi, Charity Hang in there, keep reading all our posts until you find something that works for you. Is there another name for Metadol? I don<APO>t recognize that one, and it wasn<APO>t in my drug book. It seems to me that it is a long acting pain med, but I can<APO>t recall. Read my post below Beth<APO>s on this thread. Foot rubs really do help, if only as a distraction. Keep working with your doctors, you will find a treatment plan that works for you. I am so sorry to hear about your father. Alcoholism is a terrible thing and I wouldn<APO>t wish it on anyone. Take care, Annette""I suspected that, but when I looked in up in my drug book it wasn<APO>t listed under other names of methadone. Of course, it doesn<APO>t list names of drugs used in other countries. Thanks. Hugs, Annette""My husband had numbness (total) on the top of one thigh when he had lymphoma, the doctor told him he was lucky, because if it was numb at least it could not hurt, lol. Same as your feet, huh? My husband did not think it was that funny either. How about having her rub your hands with lotion or oil. I don<APO>t think it really matters what gets rubbed. I am fine, just haven<APO>t been on line for a few days. Hugs, Annette""You should not be taking Ibuprofen and Naproxen the same day. They are both NSAIDs, they do the same thing, and it will erode your stomach lining. Pick one for the day and stick to it. Talk to your doctor about how to best use over the counter meds. NSAIDs do not usually work with the first dose. My doc told me it takes using them three times a day for up to three weeks to get the full anti-inflammatory effect as well as the analgesic effect. The stretching also needs to be done regularly, what will probably happen is that you will notice that if you skip it, you will hurt more. I never really felt like it reduced my pain immediately. Best of luck with the new doctor. Take care, Annette""The only thing I would add for the diagnosis is that the chronic pain must be above and below the waist and on both sides of the body. The pain tends to travel for no particular reason. I don<APO>t know of any more concrete method of diagnosing it either. I have read that some doctors are considering eliminating the tender point exam and not counting on it as much as they used to. My favorite website regarding FMS is http://www.myalgia.com . Take care, Annette""I would suggest you see an MD, for an examination and evaluation. They will tell you what imaging you might need. Orthopedic surgeons do not do primary care, but if you have one already, that is a good starting place. Take care, Annette""What kind of detox did she do? There is a rapid detox done under general anesthesia that can be done as a day procedure, but it costs a lot and is usually not covered by insurance. I am not aware of any other kind of detox that would not entail going through withdrawal. Of course, the withdrawal symptoms can be treated with other medications so they are managable. But that can be done as an outpatient also, so I don<APO>t see insurance paying for it. You should not even think about doing it by yourself, your doctor should always be a part of that equation. Take care, Annette""DTs are only in relation to alcohol withdrawal, not narcotic withdrawal. Other meds can also be used with narcotic withdrawal to ease the symptoms. Take care, Annette""I strongly recommend a GOOD therapist, if you are not progressing, perhaps you need a different one. I found cognitive behavioural therapy to work for me. Using the techniques cured me of depression after I stopped working due to my FMS. I have been to a variety of differently educated therapists, from MSWs to PhDs, I have found the connection matters more than the letters after their name. I was frankly ready to die, I would never actually commit suicide, but I would have been glad to get cancer and die. I used the techniques then and again when my son was on his third combat deployment, the anxiety of that one was just killing me. Now, I think they come automatically. I don<APO>t think the way I used to, it is much healthier now. No more depression, no more anxiety. I recommend you buy the book, ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns, MD. Also ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"" by Dr. Margaret A. Caudill, MD, PhD. Both books have worksheedts you can copy to track your progress. You can use these books on your own or with a therapist. My depression was fixed within a matter of months with hard work on my part. I found that antidepressants made me worse, not better, so I don<APO>t use them. Take care, Annette""I used ""Feeling Good"" first many years ago for depression, then later used both while my son was overseas for anxiety and chronic pain. I would start with ""Feeling Good"". You are right, you were self absorbed and forgot his birthday until you had been awake for a little while, your bad. So, you apologize, he accepts, and you get on with your life. We all make little mistakes over the years. My husband told me up front when we met that he is famous for forgetting birthdays, anniversaries and holidays, but as long as I remind him he will be fine. So, we got married on Xmas Eve, he can<APO>t forget that, lol. I remind him that my birthday is coming up a week or two in advance. Is that romantic, I don<APO>t really care. My mom married my dad on Norwegian Independence Day. He was Norwegian and that was the day they were liberated from the Nazis. She said that way he would never forget. She was right. I guess it runs in the family. We have been married just over 20 years, ups and downs, but mostly happy. He shows me every day that he loves me, I have long gotten over birthdays. That only happens once a year, there are 364 other days a year. Don<APO>t waste time feeling bad, tell him you love him and go from there. Take care, Annette""He needs to follow any exercise program they have suggested, as you and he both know. In addition to that he should definitely not smoke, as that can inhibit healing of bone. But, I would think by now that process would be over with. I would go for the second opinion with an orthopedic surgeon and see what he thinks. Perhaps one at a big teaching hospital. Take care, Annette""I think your orthopedist would be the one to tell you what exercises to do and when to start and how fast to increase them. The specific exercises would depend on which areas you injured. I wouldn<APO>t ask opinions of arbitrary people on line with so little information, when you already have an orthopedic doctor of your own. Take care, Annette""Yikes, if his pain is an 8 on a 0-10 scale, it does not sound like it is well controlled with his current treatment program. I don<APO>t know how he would manage on a taper, no one does until he tries it. He should have a back up plan for dealing with the pain if it gets worse. He would probably need to see the doctor more often during this process. Some people with back pain actually do better off of opiates. I would not even try the taper without assurance that the opiates would be an available treatment option for me if the taper did not work out well. I would also not automatically assume it is the meds that are affecting his cognitive abilities, I would check out other possibilities in addition to the meds. That is a good reason to always have a second person at his appts. to take notes for him. It may make you sad, but it sounds like it is necessary for now anyway. Some people are very happy with the SCS, others not so content. It is something to consider along with the other options. Only he can decide what to do, there are pros and cons to any treatment option. Take care, Annette""I took tramadol which is what the main ingredient in Ultracet is, it is just mixed with acetaminophen in Ultracet. It is not anymore addictive than hydrocodone, probably less addicting. Addiction would be rare with both drugs, something to watch out for, but not be afraid of. It can lower the seizure threshold, but I have never actually heard from anyone who had a seizure from taking it. I have read that that can occur in folks with a history of seizures or closed head injury. It never made me sick at all. I took it as a breakthrough med for a number of years, then stopped and moved on to something else. I have not heard of it being restricted to five days of use. I know toradol, a different drug entirely, but sounds similar, does have a five day restriction. I found that 100 mg. of tramadol gave me about the same relief as hydrocodone/APAP 5/500, but that was just for me and for my pain. We are all different. It is reasonable for the doctor to start out with Ultracet, and see how it works, before moving up to opiates. You may find a drug combination that works for you, without having to take opiates every day that you hurt. Pain management is just that, they try to manage your pain, they are not in the business of making a diagnosis, although they occasionally do. You can go and read about fibromyalgia at http://www.myalgia.com I found lots of good infor there. Take care, Annette""Of course, you should not go in a pool, but that is because it is not good for the lesions, not because it looks unattractive. My husband had a terrible ucler on his ankle that started with a work injury and would not heal. He had multiple infections, and a Groshong catheter in his chest for antibiotics for a couple of months. It took two years and vascular surgery on the veins beneath the injured area. Then it healed. He hated that the doctors told him not to take a tub bath or go in our hot tub until it had completely closed. He could shower quickly and then I put a new dressing on, but mostly he did standing by the bathroom sink, washcloth cleansing, and just cleaned himself that way. He needed to have his opposite hip replaced due to AVN and the doctors would not do that until the lesion was healed due to the infection problems. I am aware of how free clinics work in my area, I used to volunteer at one, but they are not all the same. Ask the doctor there if they have any infectious disease specialists or vascular surgeons or pain management doctors that are willing to donate their time. Sometimes these kind of doctors will donate an office visit even though they are unable to volunteer directly at the clinic. Perhaps another opinion on how to proceed would be useful. You stated that you are not diabetic so that is a good thing. What other possible risk factors do you have that you can control? Smoking? Taking 12 ibuprofen at a time will erode a hole in your stomach, ibuprofen is not the kind of drug where if 4 is good, 8 is better. There is a maximum dose above which taking more simply does not help. Talk to the doctor at the clinic about pain control. I do know that at our clinic, no scheduled drugs were allowed to be prescribed, so the doctors had no choice in the matter. I am not sure what you can do about clinic policy, but it would be good to know exactly what it is, especially for a long term patient like yourself. I know you have heard this before, but these kinds of skin lesions are a long term treatment challenge. Just hang in there. Take care, Annette""You may not be able to change your job, only you know that. Smoking is a variable you can control. Time to quit. Unfortunately, I had a patient once who was a smoker, she had surgery on the blood vessels in her groins to clear those blood vessels, and the skin incisions never healed because she would or could not quit smoking. She is not the only patient I have known whose smoking caused her health problems. Only you can choose when or how to quit. Can I be of any help? If only as a cheerleader? Both my parents died of lung cancer one at 46 and one at 69, both too young. Both at least partially due to smoking. No one else in the family had lung cancer. When you sit with your legs elevated, they need to be higher than your heart, not just up on a coffee table. Nice that your boss is understanding. Take care, Annette""I really don<APO>t think it matters what state you live in, if you are picky about law and order, please remember that it is illegal according to federal law and that trumps any state law. If you are not picky about law and order, then it does not matter. Marinol is only synthetic THC, it does not include any of the other ingredients of marijuana. Some people say that may be the reason it doesn<APO>t work for everyone. I personally feel that nothing works for everyone. I have not personally used Marinol, a friend used it for nausea during cancer treatment and said it worked well for her. I tried smoking and eating MJ about fifteen years ago, it did not help at all. I got high, but no pain relief at all. After a few tries, I did not use it anymore because it did not work. It was not legal in my state at that time, I discussed it with my doctors, a family practice specialist and a rheumatologist, they both told me as long as I used it ""in moderation"" I would be okay. Take care, Annette""Hi, Johnathan Just remember that this too will pass. You will have better days than you are having now. I hope the doctor will have some kind of relief for you in the morning. Take care, Annette""Do you have RSD? The comment you made about even your pants touching your legs making it hurt made me wonder. Take care, Annette""You won<APO>t know until you see one. Go see a doctor about this. Take care, Annette""The EMG is a nerve test for making a diagnosis, not a treatment for his foot pain. I have had two EMGs of my legs over the years, one hurt, the other did not hurt at all. Let the doctor explain to your son what to expect as he does the test, then just wait and see how it goes. Don<APO>t make a big deal about it ahead of time, it really is not a big deal anyway. Has he continued with the exercises ordered or did he stop after six weeks? I would ask the doctor how long it would take to see any results and if any specific results are expected. My nephew had a surgery to rebuild a congenital hip problem when he was 8, the doctor told him up front that he would not feel any different after having this surgery and a body cast for eight weeks. But it would prevent him from having arthritis really bad as an adult. He may have something that can be fixed or he may have something chronic that he will need to be aware of for many years. Take care, Annette""I think you should pick one doctor that you feel really comfortable with and stick with him. It sounds like you have seen a bunch of doctors, each for a short time. If you already have one, please forgive my suggestion. Often one doctor seen over time will figure things out better than many doctors each seeing a small window into your life. Tick borne diseases are often hard to diagnose, but the good thing is that mostly the tick must stay on your body for at least 24 hours to transmit disease. As long as you do a head to toe tick exam once a day while you are working you should be okay. My mom used to line up all of us kids at the end of the day during the summer when we were playing out in the woods, and strip us down and check us for ticks. If she found any, my dad would remove them. Being on antibiotics for one week will not rule out infection, that kind of exposure to antibiotics just causes resistance among the bacteria on your body. By all means, treat any infection you find, but don<APO>t bother with that again. Take care, Annette""I agree with Swank, I would keep her away from chiropractors for now. You are saying that the doctors do not know what is causing the pain. I wouldn<APO>t see a chiropractor without knowing what is causing the pain, how would he know not to cause worse problems? Also, you say she is getting worse anyway so it seems like a different treatment program is in order. Does she have ""breakthrough pain"" at home every day that puts her on the ground for 45 minutes? What does she do for it at home? What seems to trigger it? Does her school have a nurses<APO> office or other place where she could lay quietly until the pain passed? Could she take pain medicine at school as needed? What meds are the doctors giving her now? I also think two months is time enough off of school unless they find something, or her pain cannot be managed at school. Schools nowadays are set up to handle all kinds of health problems. If she has proper range of motion, the MRIs and other tests are all negative, I would see what the nerve test shows, and take it from there. Keep in touch. Take care, Annette""I agree with Dave, seek out a pain management doctor. There are long acting opiates you could try. Pancreatitis is a painful illness and it takes quite awhile to heal. Take care, Annette""I<APO>ve been on opiate pain meds for well over ten years, and I would love to be off of them also. However, I know I need them and function better while taking them. As a nurse, I have come to realize that most patients would rather not have to depend on their meds, no matter what kind they take. People who take high blood pressure meds or diabetes meds also wish they could stop taking them, and often try it to see how it goes. Until my pain goes away or the research people find another alternative, I will just continue with my meds. Make sure you are also doing all the non-narcotice pain treatments so you at least minimize your use of narcotics, that way you won<APO>t max out on the dose so quickly. Take care, Annette""Everyone is different in how they respond to meds, and how fast they heal. Don<APO>t smoke, keep that foot elevated HIGHER than your heart as much as possible, and take meds and use ice as directed by your doctor. If you don<APO>t keep that foot elevated much of the time, it will hurt no matter what drugs you take. You are not supposed to get much done, you are supposed to be resting and keeping it up. Take care, Annette""It sounds to me like they are willing to call you for a big $$ maker, the injections, but not for your own concerns. It seems like if she prescribed the fiorinol and it caused problems for you, she should address them. If there is something else going on, address that. I won<APO>t even talk to my son from his car, I think it is terribly dangerous to talk on the phone in a car. I don<APO>t want the last thing I hear during a call from a loved one to be a big crash. I personally make an appt. and see my doctor in person for 99% of my concerns, I have only called her on the phone one time in twelve years, and that time she had asked me to check in after starting a new med. If she told you to call in she should have made sure there was someone there to talk to you in her absence. I would talk to the doctor himself in person, and ask if this is what you should expect in the future, then you decide what you are willing to deal with. Take care, Annette""I would get another opinion from another surgeon. Or a pain management specialist. Do you notice any skin changes in your arm when it wakes you up? Nerve changes often do go away up to a couple of years after surgery, maybe it will get better, but I would go ahead and find out more about it. Take care, Annette""I have some of the same health issues as you do, and some other ones, lol. Narcotics are the wrong way to go for migraines, so I agree with your neurologist on that one. Narcotics, especially short acting ones, tend to trigger chronic daily headaches or rebound headaches, you don<APO>t want that. You might see a rheumatologist if you can<APO>t find a pain management doctor. My rheumy treated my FMS pain with opiates. But go for long acting opiates, that you take on a set schedule rather than the short acting ones to avoid the headaches. Take care, Annette""Did you know you are posting to a 3 year old post? Take care, Annette""I would be impossible for anyone to tell you what happened ten years ago. Since it has never happened again and it has been ten years it is probably okay to stop worrying about it. Sometimes things just happen and we never know just why we develop symptoms, then they go away before we do anything about it. Two colds in two months is not a big deal either, even if it is unusual for you. Colds and flu are caused by different viruses, so a cold does not turn into the flu. Two colds on their own are not enough to worry about your immune system. If your immune system develops dysfunction more than that would probably happen, things like diarrhea, skin infections, nausea, etc. Next time you see your doctor, you could ask him about it to be certain. He would have a series of questions to ask you to determine if testing would be reasonable. Take care, Annette""Having read a lot of the medical research, I really do NOT think it matters which opioid you opt to use as much as the doctor finding the right dosage for you. I have not found one double blind study that shows any one opiod works better or has fewer side effects than another. A double blind study is one where neither the doctor nor the patient knows what they are taking. The pills are disguised to all look alike. I have not personally used them all, the ones I have used all worked about the same for me once I was on a stable dose. Take care, Annette""Regarding poll results: I don<APO>t feel that this is very accurate because we have no idea how many people participated. It would be nice to have the total number of folks that voted listed somewhere. I voted for methadone as that is what I am on now, there was nothing, 0%, listed prior to me voting and 10% after I voted, so I assume that only 10 people have responded to this poll by voting, or nine other votes were cast, perhaps all by the same person. Of the other three drugs that have votes, they are rated by three votes each. I would not bother to vote in the future without knowing more about how the polls work. Take care, Annette""I have found my favorite place to find FMS info is http://www.myalgia.com It is not interactive, just lots of great information. Take care, Annette""Ditto what Swank said. Go see a doctor, not the ER if at all possible. TEDs hose are only to be used for certain problems and only with a doctor<APO>s prescription. They are not meant for use by other people, you need to have your legs carefully measured to get the right fit. I am not even sure there is any medical reason for you to wear them. TED hose as used by a surgical patient and compression hose used by a person with circulation problems are two completely different things. Is your partner a doctor? Why is he/she giving you a wheelchair to use and TED hose to wear? The fact that you had scoliosis since childhood and have some kind of pain now does not necessarily mean that the pain is from scoliosis. You really need to see a real doctor and be evaluated for your current problems. Sitting in a wheelchair may be completely the wrong treatment for you, no one really knows since you aren<APO>t currently seeing a doctor. There are many problems due to immobility, putting someone in a wheelchair, even part-time, is not to be taken lightly. Take care, Annette""How long did they tell you the pain would continue before it resolved? Glad to hear you didn<APO>t have to have surgery, that is always risky. No one here can give you much advice about the IV or anything else personal, you need to ask the doctor who examined you answer these questions. Look at your hospital discharge instructions, there may be some information there. Take care, Annette""If your rheumy said you are in the early stages of CT, what did he suggest other than the meds you mentioned that he cardiologist objected to? Why would you think that a surgery would fix things for you? I have known people who just wore the brace at night for CT, or did other kinds of non-drug treatments. Some never had surgery, and they are in their late 50s, and mid 60s. This is not an ideal world, as the cardiologist well knows, so what would he suggest in this very real world of high blood pressure and CT? Are you on any meds for high blood pressure, are you overweight, smoking, sedentary, etc.? Are there any life style changes that he suggested? Ideally, we would all be pain free and of normal weight, have normal blood pressure, and be happy. Good luck with that.... Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t have any answer as far as obtaining opiates goes, however, I do have a warning about the heating pads. It is dangerous to sit or lay on top of the heating pads, it is a good way to get burned or even start a fire. They are meant to be laid on top of you, not underneath you. I know one feels more intense heat by laying on top of the heating pad, I would suggest a hot shower or soak in the tub first, then get directly to the heating pad, preheated of course. Take care, Annette""According to my drug book Darvon is plain propoxyphene. It seems like it was available with aspirin many years ago. I don<APO>t really remember, it has been so long since I dealt with it in any way at all. I am in Oregon, and have also worked in Nevada and California. Hugs, Annette""I understand the whole 31 day RX thing, I just understood from your previous post that this was a dangerous drug in its new form. My question was why would you take a drug that you believed to be dangerous, I now understand that you have weighed the risks/benefits and decided it is better for you to continue taking it. Best of luck. Annette""I disagree with your ""independent"" whatever in the science community. Basic high school chemistry shows they are completely different. The lower case ""n"" in the binder<APO>s chemical signature and the upper case ""N"" in Propoxyphene<APO>s mean entirely different things. It may be that for YOU oxycodone works better than morphine, that does not mean that it does for everyone else. I have done some research in different opiates, and I have found no good quality, double-blind studies that show any opiate is consistently better than any other opiate. It seems that these kinds of studies either do not exist or show no difference between them. I suggest everyone try whatever their doctors and they decide is the right drug for them and see what happens. Trust me your doctor probably knows more than anyone you will meet on the internet, me included. Take care, Annette""For people who do not know, propoxyphene is the generic name for Darvon and is also the mild opiate in Darvocet N. The manufacture of both drugs was recently stopped entirely. Hi, Beth It was my understanding that propxyphene could cause cardiac problems even in theraputic doses. I had read a randomized, double blind, study many years ago that showed Darvocet N to be no more effective than plain acetaminophen in treating pain. Both Darvon and Darvocet N seemed to be related to lots of falls in elderly patients of mine and others so in my geographical area out here in the West it was rarely used even 10 years ago when I stopped working in the ER. Is it still used a lot back East where you are? Take care, Annette""No I can<APO>t understand. The two chemical signatures you showed in your previous post are not at all alike. Look at the various chemical signatures of all the different drugs in the PDR, I believe they are at the front of each particular drug<APO>s section. To someone not well versed in chemistry they will all look related. The ""propoxyphene related"" products that were cancelled are the original and any generic of Darvon and Darvocet. They would contain dextropropoxyphene, propoxyphene hydrochloride, or propoxyphene napsylate. Some contain acetaminophen, some don<APO>t. They are not a part of Oxycontin, etiher the old Oxycontin or the new OXcycontin OP. Take care, Annette""I already responded to 2. As to 1, Why would you have a problem sending a sample of a single pill of a drug that you believe is dangerous? How can they know if it is a genuine product of theirs or not if they don<APO>t even see it? They check the lot number, of course, as they will have other samples from that lot, but you might have a counterfeit pill. I suspect they would want to analyze the pill thoroughly and they can<APO>t do that with out a pill to analyze. If what you are saying is that this pill is dangerous to take due to what you believe it contains, why would you take it? Wouldn<APO>t you ask your doctor for a new RX of something else to replace this pill with? Have your ""expert"" explain to the doctor how it is similar to propoxyphene. Take care, Annette""Hi, Beth Hope you have found what works for you. I have read that since opiates slow the activity in the bowel that a laxative that increases activity in the bowel is often what is necessary. Personally, I started with increased fiber and water, and added stool softeners, and then added a laxative as needed. I hope you enjoyed Thanksgiving. We are retired and having no company for dinner so we actually had our turkey a few days ago. Today, we are just saying thanks for all the good things in our lives. When I was growing up we always had holiday dinners around 6-7 pm. My brother<APO>s best friend used to eat with his family early on at noonish, then eat again at our house, then offered to wash the dishes so he could eat even more, lol. Hugs, Annette""FMS includes pain both above and below the waist. The poster only mentioned pain above the waist. Take care, Annette""Go see a doctor and see what he says. The wound is three years old. If that was the last time a doctor saw you about it, or even if it has been 6 months to a year since a doctor saw you about it, there is no way of even knowing why you have the pain. You could have scar tissue, or inflammation or an infection, all could be approached differently. Take care, Annette""Hi, Swank Did I miss something? I didn<APO>t see where it was posted that it was self-inflicted? How would that matter for the treatment? Take care, Annette""Hi, Swank I totally agree that there is far more to this story than what was posted. There seem to be a lot of posts recently about ""medical"" marijuana use. Take care, Annette""Try taking less oxycodone to start out with, it may be that the combination of morphine and oxycodone is more than you need. Sedation from opiates is usually do to taking too much. Oxycodone is not meant to perk you up, just to relieve pain. Take care, Annette""Morphine and hydromorphone do not equate mg. to mg. as far as their pain relieving abilities. Opiates also have only a partial cross tolerance, so a lower dose of one may easily replace a higher equianalgesic dose of another. Give it a try, I don<APO>t see that you have anything to lose. Check your insurance formulary and see if methadone or levorphanol is covered, those are two older long acting pain meds that are usually very cheap. It may make you feel better just to know that you have other options. Take the formulary to your pharmacist or to your doctor and ask him just which long acting opiates are covered. Explain to your doctor, if you haven<APO>t already, that you are confined to that list for financial reasons. Take care, Annette""I think you are somewhat misinformed about the chemistry of the opiates and synthetic opiates. Codeine is a derivative of morphine which is a derivative of opium (poppies). Those are all natural derivatives of opium poppies. Hydrocodone, methadone, fentanyl, and oxycodone and some others are synthetic drugs, entirely man-made without the use of poppies. None of that really matters as long as you do not have an allergy to opium derivatives. Whatever works for you, in whatever dose is proper for you is what matters. Most dentists in my area prescribe percocet or vicoden if they feel an opiate is necessary, which is rarely, they use a lot of ibuprofen here. Most doctors give percocet or a generic of that drug for pain after major surgery in my area, that is what my husband was given by his surgeon after a total hip replacement two years ago. Oral morphine was always consdered too weak to give after surgery, but it is used by injection right after surgery or in the ER alot. When I lived in a state that required triplicate RXs for percocet, tylenol with codeine was very popular with ER docs and surgeons. I have found in my travels that geography has a lot to do with what drugs are used. Again you AND YOUR DOCTOR are the best people to figure out your meds. What is scheduled on which DEA schedule or what the drug comes from is not nearly as important as what works best for you. Take care, Annette""What other treatments are you using for pain and your depression besides the opiates? It is possible that opiates are not the correct treatment for your pain, at least not by themselves. Are you using any adjuvant medications? I am shocked that in eight years you have gone up to 240 mg. of MS Contin plus the oxycodone for BT pain. With fentanyl you went up to 140 mcg/hr in 2-3 months and it wasn<APO>t working. Perhaps the opiates are not the right pain treatment for your pain? My questions would be these: is this truly tolerance, is your illness/disease/disorder getting worse, do you need something entirely different for pain, are you having a rare case of opiate induced hyperalgesia? Food for thought. Take care, Annette""Hydrocodone mixed with an over-the-counter drug like acetaminophen is a schedule III, it is only a schedule II when prescribed alone. A compounding pharmacy would have to make it up as no drug companies prepare it alone. I agree that hydrocodone and oxycodone are not ""weak"" opiates. Hugs, Annette""It doesn<APO>t matter to me if we agree to disagree. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""We are all wrong sometimes, I would hope you will correct me when it is my turn? I just want people to have accurate info, I double check most things before I post in reference books. I think the wind is blowing all the way to the west coast, we are having a huge blow right now. Cold too. Fortunately the power is still on. I agree with you, doctors hate to prescribe inconvenient drugs. The schedule II drugs cannot be called in to the pharmacy, the patient must have the paper RX with them when they go to get it filled. No refills either. Schedule III drugs can be called in and the doctor can check the original for refills, I think up to six months. In some states the doctor must fill out a triplicate RX for schedule II drugs, that is up to each state though. Here in Oregon they don<APO>t have triplicates, but they did in Calif. when I worked there. I don<APO>t understand this ""weak"" opioid thing. I just scolded my friend for taking five percocets at once while he was drinking. He is not opioid tolerant, he got them from a ""friend"". He could have died from respiratory depression, and I told him so. He was shocked. He thought they were perfectly safe because that was what his ""friend"" told him. You are right, I have worked all over the hospital and in outpatient medicine also, a total of forty years I have been licensed. I guess I know a little about everything, you are certainly more expert in your field than I am. Everyone should talk to their own doctors about specific things. I just like to have a lively discussion and provide accurate info when I can. Hugs, Annette""Okay, if you don<APO>t want to be sedated, don<APO>t take opiates. They all have that as a side effect according to everything I have read in my drug handbooks.""He is fine for now. He was on a binge so he was drunk and couldn<APO>t sleep. A friend gave him the meds and I really scolded him when I talked to him on the phone. I have known too many people who died of accidental overdoses using drugs and alcohol. Most of the intentional suicides in my family and circle of friends were by gunshot or hanging. It affects the families far more than people realize. My son<APO>s father, my ex-husband, died of respiratory failure also, I believe that a multitude of drugs were involved as he was a poly-pharmacy kind of guy by then. He didn<APO>t use drugs while we were married. He was found dead in a cheap residential hotel room. So sad. The first I heard from him in about five years was the coroner<APO>s call. My son was 15 and still hoping his dad would be a dad. I am so sorry that you have lost a loved one this way. Hugs, Annette""There is a variety of meds out there to try, I would let the doctor decide and give it a try. I totally understand what you mean when you mentioned other people noticed changes in you that you were unaware of. I always let my husband know when I am taking a new med, so he can share with me any observations he has. Nausea and itching are common side effects of all opiates, and usually that goes away after a fairly short time, maybe a few weeks. There are other non-drug options also. Just work with your doctor and do your own research just to be sure. I use http://www.myalgia.com. I have found them to be very accurate and helpful regarding FMS related topics. I am a retired nurse also, what areas did you work in? I have kept up my Calif. license with continuing education classes, I found I was just unable to give up my license, though I have not worked for a while now. Take care, Annette""I recommend http://www.myalgia.com They have a lot of good FMS information there, including meds and other treatments. You might think about printing out info to take to your doctor to discuss. Take care, Annette""Sorry, for home remedies I use my hot tub, if you have a heating pad that might help too. I use neurontin 800 mg. once a day for FMS symptoms, I love it, but I don<APO>t understand why you would be using it for ""crying jags""? Take care, Annette""I love Gregorian Chants. I was raised Episcopalian, but went to Mass with my best friend and her dad and sister for many, many years. Nowadays, I decline to even self describe as a Christian, too many bad ""Christians"" out there I don<APO>t want to be associated with, lol. I found some years ago when my son was deployed and I couldn<APO>t sleep that saying the Apostles<APO> Creed, the Niscene (sp?) Creed, or the ""Our Father"", or indeed anything I had memorized as a child was useful in breaking the anxiety and helping me tip over and relax enough to go to sleep. I don<APO>t think it really matters what you use as a basis, the meditative power is great enough to help with pain or sleep. Take care, Annette""As much as I love your vision of me, I am used to me as I am. I am 5<APO>5"", brunette, short hair, fat, and 60 years old. I have never been blond or thin, lol. I much prefer the second paragraph of your description of me. That is what I strive for. You are cute in your photo, I adore your smile. You come across very honest, and you seem like a good nurse, enough said, another nurse knows what that means. Hugs, Annette""Ouch, nothing seems like it would be worse than a bad toothache. Hopefully, the motrin will take down the swelling and the pain until you can see the dentist. Actually, I have heard from more than one person that motrin works better than pain meds for toothaches. Great photo! I am not a blond, just a mousy brunette, with lots of gray mixed in. I forgot to add that to my post to Beth. Take care, Annette""I forgot to add there is gray in my brunette hair now, lol. My husband tells me it is still more brown than gray, but I am not so sure. I have let it go natural, no hair color anymore. I am going down to visit my son and his wife and two boys for Xmas. They haven<APO>t seen it uncolored, I haven<APO>t decided yet whether to color it just for the trip or leave it natural???? Any votes? Take care, Annette""Hi, Johnathan I am glad you are feeling better. I think I prefer to be a tall, blond, super model type, lol. Maybe some day I will post a photo... Take care, Annette""Those things DO help. I saw a therapist who specialized in pain management years ago, and she taught me those techniques along with cognitive behavioral techniques that have really helped me. I still take meds though, lol. Take care, Annette""I started belly dancing along with the TV or DVDs the end of last April. I am up to 1 1/2 - 2 hours almost every day now and I have to say it does make me feel better. I have adjusted some of the moves of course to help deal with my FMS, but it is a lot of fun. It has increased my pain some of the time, and decreased it a bit some of the time. My doctor adjusted my pain meds and told me ""No one should decrease their activity because of increased pain."" I wish it would fix it so I could go off the pain meds, but I don<APO>t see that coming. Take care, Annette""Glad it worked for you. It didn<APO>t help me. My insurance did pay a portion of it. We are all different. I would die for anything that decreased my pain by 90%. Take care, Annette""It has not for me, in fact I have been slowly but surely losing weight, a total of about 35 pounds over the last 2-3 years. No dieting or any intent on my part. My doctor examined me, and tested my blood for thyroid problems, etc., and all is well. I am happy when I weigh in at the doctor<APO>s office and find I have lost a pound or two. I remember when I could lose 10-15 pounds easily in three or four weeks, not any more. I am fat and have been most of my adult life. I think with most drugs, neurontin and Lyrica included, the thing is they may increase our appetite and the easiest thing to grab may be junk food. I would suggest keeping low calorie food ready and when the munchies hit, eat something good for you instead of grabbing cookies, ice cream, etc. Think about what you put in your mouth. A good friend of mine gained a huge amount of weight while on certain antidepressants. We no longer lived near each other, but we spent a vacation together at a friend<APO>s home, and I saw a HUGE change in HOW much and HOW often she ate. She ate constantly, and it was always junk food. She had never had a weight problem before, she was probably in her late 40s. She just said it was the drugs that made her fat and did nothing about it. We are now in our early 60s and she has not been able to get rid of the weight. It is really hard at our age to exercise enough and reduce our intake enough to lose a lot of weight quickly, like we did in our 20s. Her sisters and I could diet or take diet pills when we were in our 20s and wanted to drop a few pounds, she never needed to. She hates being fat, it hasn<APO>t bothered me that I am fat for well over 30 years. I would like to be thinner, but I don<APO>t smoke, drink, or do illegal drugs, I am not sedentary anymore, I guess food is my only vice, lol. I should do better with it. I think we all need to be aware of our weight, and if we start gaining or losing for no reason, look at it immediately with our doctors. But, especially when we get into middle age. When you start a new drug, be aware and see what effects it has on you. Not everyone gets every side effect from a drug. My drug handbook says that about 16% of Lyrica users complained of weight gain, and only 2-3% of neurontin users complained of weight gain. Keep in mind that drug makers have to put down every symptom someone complains of, no one has to prove it comes from the drug itself. For this reason, I tend to ignore anything that fewer than 10% of users complained of. Just my personal cutoff mark, no real medical studies to prove anything. I suggest you read everything you can find that is evidence based (not opinions), then make up your own mind with your doctor what drug to take. Then see how you do on it. You can always stop taking a drug if you develop symptoms. Take care, Annette""Thanks for the input. I prefer leaving it natural, just don<APO>t want to shock the kids, lol. Take care, Annette""Hi Beth, My DVDs have warm up sections, then lessons, then a choreography section at the end. I got my DVDs at http://www.OceanStateMedia.com and have several favorite instructors. Autumn Ward is very artistic, Sadie is very athletic, and Jenna does a DVD called ""Belly Dance, Basics and Beyond"" that I find very fun to do. Some of them use one name, and some use their full names. Sarah Skinner does DVDs also, she is much more into just doing what feels good. My husband has a multi-disc DVD player so I put three or four DVDs in and do part of each one. I actually bought an outfit from http://moondancebellydance.com , they are cheap and fun. Skip a veil, you don<APO>t need one for awhile anyway. Only my dogs have seen me in my costume, lol. I know this was not part of the weight loss for the first 25 pounds or so, because I wasn<APO>t doing it then, but I am sure it helps now. It is just plain, fun. Try Jenna first and see if you like it. Hugs, Annette""I disagree about the thyroid medicine. My doctor talked to an endocrinologist at a teaching hospital near us, and he felt strongly that you should only take thyroid supplements if you test low and really need them because you are hypothyroid. I had read the material you mentioned and copied it out for my doctor to read. She discussed it with him while I was sitting there in the office. He feels it may make your own thyroid gland function at a less than normal rate. I also talked to a rheumatologist that I saw as a consult and he agreed. How do you feel on the synthroid, does it make you feel any better, how does your doctor decide how much to give you and for how long? Do you have to have your blood tested? My Vit D level was low-normal, my doctor has me taking 2,000 units a day. That brought me well withing the normal range. I read recently that one should not take more than 10,000 units a day, do you take your vit D daily? I am a believer in exercise, it really makes me feel better all round. Of course, it sometimes increases my pain, but my doctor gives me pain meds for that. My hot tub is also a great option. Take care, Annette""I have always had a T3, T4 and TSH done. They are all well within the normal range. I tried Lyrica briefly some years ago, it was not any better than the neurontin I was already taking, so I went back to that. It was also available in generic so it was much cheaper. All drugs have side effects, but not all people get all the side effects. I have never had weight gain, or water retention with either Lyrica or neurontin, a very closely related chemical. I don<APO>t believe in taking thyroid hormone supplements if one has no problems with their own thyroid glands doing what they are supposed to do. I remember back when healthy women were given thyroid supplements to increase their energy or lose weight. I think it is generally a bad idea, I remember women having all kinds of problems doing that. I want to see data from double blind studies if possible and learn more about it, before I put my health at risk. Take care, Annette""How long have you been taking it? What meds have you been able to discontinue since starting the synthroid? Take care, Annette""On the site I have mentioned previously, http://www.myalgia.com , there is a section that describes a year long study they did on guaifenisin at OHSU. They used a randomized, double blind study, it showed that the guaifenisin was no better than a placebo. I have read this and other articles about guai and I would not bother with it. Just my opinion. Hugs, Annette""I am aware of this drug. I am glad you are having positive results with it. I wait at least five years after a drug has been approved by the FDA, that is when you see what kinds of side effects it actually causes when used long term. The long term safety studies are only one year long for most drugs, and we may be taking them for a lifetime. I think Savella is related to antidepressants and works on the serotonin and norepinepherine neurotransmitters (If I remember correctly). I have tried many of these types of drugs and they did not work out well for me. I will wait and see what the results are of lots of people taking this drug. Take care, Annette""No excuses for a rude doctor. Most MDs have little or no training with herbals and supplements, so you might have been asking the wrong person. Try seeing a naturopath before you get pregnant and ask them about black cherry extract and other possiblities. When your MD was talking about natural treatments, she may have meant non-drug treatment. That said, I don<APO>t think that any substance you would take into your body that would help you enough with your pain would not also have side effects with or without pregnancy being mixed in. How do you think you will manage with your back pain and meds AND having/raising a child? I would be more concerned with the 18 years after giving birth than the nine months before. I would also consider seeing a high risk OB doc and ask what he/she could do for you or suggest. Take care, Annette""It would be a tough decision to make. I was lucky that my child was already a teenager when I first had chronic pain symptoms. He was only home for a year or so while I was sick. I had been a single mom for about ten years before I married my present husband. It was hard, I always wished a day had about 30 hours in it rather than 24. Talk to a naturopath and a high risk OB and find out what your options are. There are so many paths to becoming a parent these days, I am sure you will find a way. Take care, Annette""Since it was medical marijuana the doctor must have prescribed it or advised you to use it, so what<APO>s the problem? Take care, Annette""Gotcha, you are talking about the Department of Corrections. I don<APO>t know of any state in which the DOC accepts marijuana as a medical treatment rather than an illegal drug. Yes, you should worry, it may well show up positive. If you have a RX for this, be honest when they ask you if you are taking any RX drugs. My sister used to be a parole officer, she claimed they went easier on people who told them the truth if their urine was going to be dirty, than they did on people who lied and tried to fool them. I don<APO>t know if that is true or not but I suspect it is. I hate it when someone tried to put one over on me, which you may be doing, lol. If you really do not have a RX and were just getting high with friends over the holiday, you are up a creek without a paddle. Good luck to you. Take care, Annette""There are risks to all medicines, but that said I took high doses of ibuprofen for well over two years before I had neck surgery. It really helped with the pain and inflammation. My doctor saw me regularly and did blood tests to monitor my liver and kidney function. I also knew the symptoms of a GI bleed and knew to stop the meds and see my doctor immediately at first sign of those symptoms. It often takes 3-4 weeks for the full anti-inflammatory effect of ibuprofen to kick in. It is great that you are already seeing improvement. Take care, Annette""I agree with Swank and Beth. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I don<APO>t believe that the manufacturer of the drug makes a difference. I have used many different generics for MS Contin, I took it for about twelve years, they all seem pretty much the same to me. I think the price varies depending on what kind of a deal the pharmacy makes with his supplier. If money is an issue, I would think about changing to a cheaper drug. I switched to methadone from a generic MS Contin so I would not get stuck in the donut hole in my Medicare part D drug plan. I used it either every 8 hours or every 12 hours as I went up with the total daily dosage due to increased pain or tolerance (who really knows which?). I took 30 mg. every 12 hours, then 30 mg. every 8 hours, then 60 mg. every 12 hours. I only adjusted it about every 3-4 years. If the drug is ordered every 12 hours, and you take it as ordered, you wouldn<APO>t run out early. This is not a med to be taken as needed, it should be on a schedule. Tell your doctor and your pharmacy that you need cheap meds and ask them to order them accordingly, although I don<APO>t think the pharmacy can give oyu any special deals. Take care, Annette""Great news!!! Hugs, Annette""Is it prescribed for pain relief, why exactly do you wear it? Anything that helps is a positive as far as I am concerned. Hugs, Annette""Out here where I live we just call them clam shell braces, I think. I have had home health patients with some kinds of back problems wear them. They wore them over a light t-shirt. No one liked wearing them, but they helped some people. The patient had a mold made of their body then the clam shell part was custom made. Does that sound the same as what you wear? Hugs, Annette""I don<APO>t get how people can make fun of someone<APO>s gait, I have seen folks fight to be able to walk at all. Please let me apologize for those rude people. Ignore them!! Hugs, Annette""I will confess that I have never owned or wore a real pair of heels. Way back in nursing school they showed us what feet looked like after wearing heels for 15-20 years. No thanks, lol. They looked very similar to the skeletons of women who had bound feet. I was 18 and very impressionable, lol. Up until then I had maybe worn 2 inch heels to a prom or a dance in high school. My mom wore at least 3 inch heels from her 20s on through her sixties. She even wore heels taking care of five kids and doing housework. Then she grew afraid of falling and breaking a hip, probably from what I brought home, lol. She had to slowly go down to flat shoes as her tendons had shortened along the backs of her legs. It took her about five years to get to flats and sneakers. I like what Oprah says about her heels, she wears them on stage only. She never has to walk far on them. I can<APO>t believe those crazy folks on makeover shows that insist women give up comfort and wear pointy, high heels. Great discussion. Hugs, Annette""Sorry, but you lost me when you asked what we would do if we took a pain pill and still had pain. I WOULD NOT take another pill, I would call my doctor<APO>s office, and see her, and discuss face to face what to try next. I have been on pain meds for about 15 years now, and I have never run out of pills early. If your present doctor is not helping you try another one. Take care, Annette""Yes, it would be wrong. In many states it is a felony to get opiates from more than one doctor without telling them all about each other and what you are getting from each of them. Work with the new doctor and give the new meds a chance. All change is scary. Ask the new doctor how to handle urgent matters if he is not available to see you, does he accept emails or phone consultations? Take care, Annette""Fibro does NOT cause death, nor does it generally cause the need for a wheelchair. Deconditioning can occur when people hit the couch and bed when they are in pain or feel fatigued, they still need to exercise and move those muscles. I feel much better all around on the days I keep moving. I still have pain, but I am still walking, lol. I have had Fibro for well over ten years now. When medical people call a condition progressive they are referring to a continued deterioration of the structures, like joints erode when you have arthritis. Fibro does not cause deterioration of any tissues, so it is not considered progressive. However, the symptoms, especially of pain and fatigue, can get worse over time, especially if one does not take good care of themselves. You and your sister might visit www.myalgia.com for good medical info about Fibro. This site is hosted by a Fibro group in Oregon and the rheumatologists who do research on Fibro at the university there contribute articles. It is not an interactive site like this one is. It just has articles and links to other places to get good info. It may be time for your sister to see a rheumatologist who specializes in Fibro treatment in addition to other conditions. Ask before she makes the appt. if the doctor actively treats Fibro patients, not all rheumatologists do. Take care, Annette""Ease up on yourself. Exercise more moderately every day instead of strenuously. I find it reduces my pain much less than I hoped, but it makes me feel better generally. So, I keep it up. Take care, Annette""On the Fibro Message Board here there is a tool box of hints that may help you. I personally do not believe that cortisone injections are appropriate for FMS, a friend sees a chiro and is happy with her care. I suggest you go read the info at http://www.myalgia.com . They have a lot of good stuff there. Take care, Annette""I would suggest you try acetaminophen, naproxen, or ibuprofen, those are the over-the-counter pain meds. I had read a study awhile back that showed Darvocet to give about the same amount of pain relief as plain acetaminophen in a double blind study. Other than that there is acetaminophen with codeine, or hydrocodone with acetaminophen those require prescriptions of course. Take care, Annette""I am not sure why you take narcotics for migraines? They are not the first choice anymore. There are much better ways of dealing with migraines than taking opiates which can cause rebound headaches. You have a lot of medical issues, best dealt with by your doctors. I take neurontin nightlyfor FMS and migraines, opiates for pain, and ambien for sleep and RLS symptoms. I have a bad history of migraines, and the neurontin really cut them back. I take reglan and aspirin, or compazine when a migraine starts and have not had to go to the ER for over 12 years. I use a stimulant type laxative (over the counter) as needed for constipation, I also use a stool softener. Talk to your doctor, they all have their own preferences for bowel care. We are all different and different meds work for different people. Take care, Annette""My doctor does a detailed drug screen occasionally. I don<APO>t worry about it because I know I take my meds as prescribed. You are taking a lot of meds: percocet, soma, neurontin, Zoloft, and Xanax. Many of those have sedating qualities. Usually that goes away, like your doctor told you with regular use. It has been shown in medical studies that it is better to take your pain meds when you first feel the pain, rather than waiting until it is unbearable. People end up taking LESS medicine that way, rather than if they wait until the pain is really bad, AND they get better relief. I don<APO>t understand the drug test he used. But, I would work with him and take your meds as prescribed, then report to the doctor any side effects or concerns you have as they come up. If you feel he isn<APO>t listening to your concerns, as for a consultation with another pain management doctor. Take care, Annette""I am very sorry for your loss. Although you should feel free to speak to a lawyer regarding your sweetie<APO>s death, I am afraid it will not do you much good. Unless of course the coroner made it easy for you and listed fentanyl as the cause of death on his death certificate. I don<APO>t think going on a path to destroy fentanyl will help. I think it is usually the user or the doctor rather than the drug itself that caused the problem. Wait awhile and get past this difficult time in your life, then look at the evidence with more open eyes and do what is right. Again, I am so sorry for your loss. Take care, Annette""Headaches can come on at any age, I started having migranes at age 35, never used to have headaches at all. Obviously, his stroke triggered his headache. I would go to a big medical center/teaching hospital. I went from Reno, NV down to San Francisco to UC-SF and had a neuro consult done there. Best of luck to you both. Take care, Annette""Beth is having a spinal cord stimulator put in to help manage her pain. I have never heard of having one for headaches though. I don<APO>t know of any surgery for headaches unless you have an identifiable tumor or something like that. Botox has been approved for use for migraines now, has he tried that? Learn all you can about headaches and their treatment. There is lots of new material out there. Go over his meds with his doctor when you get the insurance coverage, see if any of his meds can cause rebound headaches or chronic daily headaches. Is there any kind of drug that he started taking right after his stroke that could be contributing to these headaches? Take care, Annette""I am not sure that the spinal cord stimulator that is used for spinal pain would work for your husband<APO>s migraines/headaches. I don<APO>t recall it being good for brain issues at all. Perhaps there is something else, you might have him see a pain management specialist that handles both interventions and non-procedure type treatments. An SCS may or may not help your neck problems though. Please keep in mind that you saw an orthopedic SURGEON about your neck so I would expect him to offer you surgical options. I would also see a neurologist (not a neurosurgeon) and ask what other non-surgical treatment options may be available for your neck. You might also see a pain management specialist who handles both interventions, and non-interventions like therapy, CBT, biofeedback, acupuncture, oral medication management, etc. I have had one disectomy in my cervical spine, and have another herniation, and some bulging discs. I would not have any kind of surgery for pain alone, only for functional problems. But that is just me. Everyone has their own take on things. Take care, Annette""How old are you? When my son was about 15 or 16 I offered to wait in the waiting room and let him have some privacy with the doctor. You should never take medicine more than the doctor prescribed. If the instructions on the bottle say to ""take one or two tablets every four to six hours as needed for pain"", then you are okay. But, if it says to only take one pill at a time, you should follow those directions. If it isn<APO>t enough then you call the doctor or go see him and ask him to change it. Why do your parents think you are only taking advil? Who pays for your meds? Did you buy your own RX? I would just be honest with the doctor and tell him what you are doing and why. I would tell your dad you feel better seeing the doctor alone, he will probably be fine with that unless you are really young. Then he has a right to look after you as he sees fit until you are older. Keep in touch, I think you may have already seen the doctor by now. Take care, Annette""I am a mother too, and I would not jump to that conclusion. Lots of kids smoke pot, as do a lot of adults, for lots of reasons. Most of their reasons are not very good, lol. Some people smoke it every day, others use it occasionally. That would make it a different story entirely. It is a big jump to getting high smoking pot to taking opiates to get high. I would really have a problem with my son taking opiates to get high. I would discuss this openly with my son and decide together what to do. I think most parents are able to assess their kids for pain and decide what kind of meds they need, along with the doctor of course. I totally agree about being open with your doctor about any illegal drug use, including smoking pot. All drugs interact in the body, he needs to know for your safety. I found many years ago that pot does not help my chronic pain at all. I think most medical marijuana is bogus, just my opinion. Take care, Annette""I am always glad to hear someone is doing better!!! Did you get your flu shot this year? I swear by them now, haven<APO>t missed one in about 15 years. I can<APO>t imagine having the flu on top of my usual owies. Take care, Annette""Thanks for the link. I have used that site for awhile, lots of good information there. I think we should all share as we can any time of the year, not just around the holidays. I agree with your mom about buying food instead of giving people cash, but to each their own. Take care, Annette""The lovely things you said will make my Xmas warm and nice. Thank you. I am not sure if I will post right up until I go away or not, we will see how busy I get. I am so glad the surgery went well, I hope the SCS is all you hoped for. Hugs, Annette""Thanks, Caprice. I will enjoy seeing the family. But, I will miss this family too. Thank you for all you do for all of us here at WebMD. Have great holidays yourself. Hugs, Annette""I hope all goes well for you. Take care of yourself. Hugs, Annette""I am so glad everything is working out for you with the surgery and all. I am going to my son<APO>s house in southern California next Wed. for a couple of weeks. I will be home towards the end of the month. No posting for me while I am on vacation, lol. I hope your Xmas turns out great, and your kids and family all baby you. Hugs, Annette""I always opt for generics when available. Right now all my meds are generic. I have had 5-6 different generics for my pain meds, depending on what deal the pharmacy has this month with what company. I have found they all work the same. There is no scientific reason to think that changing from a brand name drug to a generic would make any difference in your tolerance level. Some people swear by the brand name drugs, but double blind studies have found no difference in how well the generics and brand name drugs work or their side effect profiles. Take care, Annette""Why would you not want your present doctor to know that the meds were not working? Getting opiates from two different doctors and not telling them about each other is a felony in many states. I would let him know what you are doing. Take care, Annette""Go to the doctor!!! See if there are any free/low cost clinics in your area, and go. If you have a bacterial sinus infection, it can travel to the ear and cause an infection there. My son who never had ear infections had two inside of a couple of months, The doctor treated them and each time they went away. The doctor told us that one more and he would get a CT scan of his sinuses to see if the infection was really starting there. Sinus infections require a different treatment plan than ear infections, they can be harder to get rid of. Thankfully, he did not get another one. Certainly drainage can cause nausea and vomiting, but so can pain and other things. There are no over the counter meds for nausea that I am aware of. Take care, Annette PS, I knew someone once who ended up with a brain infection, because she did not get an ear infection taken care of. She was very sick, and had permanent hearing damage.""What exactly did the doctor give as a reason for not clearing you? We cannot just guess what he is thinking. Did he say in writing that he felt you were unsafe due to your medicines? I saw a neuro-psychologist years ago, he was a great guy. He did a lot of tests on me, I was there for about four hours. I would ask the doctor up front what he is thinking if he did not put it in writing. Take care, Annette""Walking around and being active may well help if you are having gas pains, exercise gets the gas moving so you can expel it. Gas is usually painful when it gets to the intestines rather than the stomach.. Only a doctor can diagnose you and tell you exactly what is wrong. Some people get digestive problems with antibiotics. You might find an anatomy chart somewhere and learn where your various organs are, everyone would benefit from that information. Take care, Annette""Are there financial issues at play here? Most hospitals and surgeons do not provide much aftercare of surgical patients after the immediate postop period. Have you seen a gastroenterologist, internist, or a PCP recently? Take care, Annette""Have you actually seen a doctor to have the cause of the pain in your hands diagnosed? Lately, like in the last year or so? Other than the doctor who gave you cortisone for a suspected carpal tunnel syndrome, of course. Maybe that is what you have and some cortisone and a brace for your wrist is all you need. You talk about ""smashing"" ganglion cysts in your hands/wrists. That has not been done by most doctors in the last 20 years or so. Is a doctor doing it, or are you doing it yourself? How do you diagnose these ganglion cysts? Have you had xrays or MRIs or something else? There are many permanent treatments for some kinds of pain, so you would not necessarily be looking at being on vicodin or any kind of pain meds long term. Take care, Annette""I agree with you for the most part. I have been seeing my current doctor for about 15 years now. When I was in Reno, I saw the same doctor for 10 years. It is best for the two of you to get to know each other well, and develop a trusting relationship. Trust goes both ways, I need to trust my doctor and she needs to be able to trust me. Take care, Annette""I would ask the doctor for a referral to someone else since she cannot manage your pain. If you can<APO>t find a pain management doctor that suits you, then I would find a new pcp. My pcp manages my pain just fine. Take care, Annette""Everyone is different, so no two people will necessarily respond the same to medicines. I believe the best thing it to just be honest with your doctor. Tell him everything that is going on with you and really listento his recommendations. Many things can cause problems with erections, and often it is just part of being a man. No man your age really believes that losing an erection happens to all men as some time, but it does. Losing an erection one time does not mean it is due to your spinal nerves so don<APO>t worry about that until it is time. As my mom said, ""Don<APO>t cross that bridge until you come to it."" Could it be a spinal nerve problem, maybe so, it could also be due to diabetes, medicines, and many other things. No one should just take Viagra, you should see a urologist and find out if and why there is a problem, then they can treat it the right way for you. Doctors and nurses have heard it all, you can<APO>t say anything that will shock them. You will be far more embarrassed than they will be, your doctor should make it easier for you once he understands what you are getting at. Talk to your doctor about all this, it will be fine. Take care, Annette""Well, hang in there, and see what happens with your new doctor, hopefully, things will go well and you will gradually feel better. Take care, Annette""The number of milligrams in each pill is not an indication of the comparison of strength between two different meds. The oxycodone in percocet is stronger mg. for mg. than the hydrocodone in other meds. Methadone is generally used as a long acting opioid on a set schedule, and is completely different from hydrocodone or oxycodone. In my experience methadone is usually started out at 5 mg. per dose for chronic pain, it is then titrated as needed. Maybe your visits are too quick? Do you have time to explain to him just how you are feeling? It sounds like you are using two different meds now, the methadone and the percocet? Did the doctor you went to before prescribe hydrocodone 20-30 mg. at a time? Or is that just how you decided to take it? Take care, Annette""I hate to be the one to say this, but YOU need to take these meds exactly the way the new doctor prescribes them. If your old doctor told you to take one Norco 10/325 every eight hours, but you were taking 2-3 (as you said earlier) and maybe another because you ""couldn<APO>t sleep"", you were NOT following his directions. You were comparing hydrocodone 20-30 mg. to 5 mg. of Percocet, one dose, not your total daily dose. I do understand wanting to take more because it still hurts, but with all the drugs you are on, that can kill you. You can go to sleep and just not wake up. Especially the methadone, either by itself or mixed with benzos. With methadone you cannot take two because one doesn<APO>t quite kill the pain. It works completely differently than the other opiates do. If your present doctor decides you are not following his directions exactly, he is ethically fine simply refusing to write your RXs or refusing to even see you again. Remember, trust goes both ways. Take care, Annette""It is a really bad idea to take your mom<APO>s pain meds, or for her to give them to you, ditto meds from your friends. See what the pain management doctor has to say. I would suggest you follow his directions, get to know him and develop a trusting relationship with him. Take care, Annette""I would just tell your doctor what symptoms you are having and how your present meds are working. Tell him about the episode where you lost your erection, but don<APO>t jump to conclusions about ED. Ask him if he feels you need to see a urologist. He may ask you a lot of questions about sexual function. You probably do not have ED. Wait and see if it happens again and again. If you are a smoker, you should quit. Smoking can effect erectile function. I would not ask for a specific opiate. I would just tell him how you are doing (not well), and that you believe something stronger might help you. I am not a strong believer in Oxycontin specifically. It is only available in brand name form and is pretty expensive. There are other long acting opiates that are available in generic that would be cheaper and probably work just as well. I have been on opiates daily for about 15 years, and do quite well on generic pain meds. I think your doctor probably knows best what to try you on. Take care, Annette""Anyone who has pain or even deals with someone who is in pain ""qualifies"" to be here, in fact anyone can post here. Most places chronic pain is defined as pain that has lasted at least three months, some places say six months. Glad to hear you don<APO>t smoke, that is a nasty habit that does bad things to so many parts of our bodies. I have taken long acting morphine, then methadone, and hydrocodone/APAP and oxycodone/APAP for breakthrough pain. But there are lots of different kinds of opiates available, just discuss that with your doctor when the time comes. I agree that especially because of your young age, as with everyone of any age, you should try all other available meds before you decide to go on long term opiates. They are not meds to be taken lightly, but they do work for many people, including me. They do have some side effects, but they vary for everyone. Take care, Annette""Oxycodone is the opiate in percocet and roxicodone both. It really does not matter which formula you opt to use, it is the dose that matters. I personally have mixed feelings about using any benzo along with any opiate. I don<APO>t think it is a good idea as an ongoing treatment plan. That is my personal opinion. It is one thing getting an injection of valium or versed for a procedure, another thing altogether when you take something on a daily basis. That is between you and your doctor. I am a bit confused by your comment at the beginning of the last paragraph of your post, ""I<APO>m so glad I<APO>m not easily sedated because I got a stronger dose of Klonopin....."" I personally think the smaller dose you can use of any drug (and still get effective treatment) the better. The point of giving valium before an epidural is to take away the anxiety, so I am glad they got that right for you. I am glad you have found a doctor that you feel comfortable with, I hope you have a long and fruitful relationship. Take care, Annette""Long acting oral pain meds are designed to give continuous coverage of chronic pain. I have used them for about 10 years, and I do not have an ""onrush of severe pain"" after a few hours, or ever for that matter. I take a generic of MS Contin (morphine) every 12 hours, with short acting breakthrough pain meds as needed. This is consistent with prescribing practice for chronic pain. I have used the long acting morphine every 8 hours and every 12 hours over the years, and have found both to work just fine. I have not found a need for the breakthrough pain meds specifically towards the end of my dosing period. The morphine works fine clear through its dosing period. I declined the fentanyl patches years ago because I use my hot tub for pain relief and they are not appropriate for folks who use a hot tub or sauna. Fentanyl patches are a great option for those folks who find them to work, as are the oral meds a great option for those people who find them to work. Everyone should try the different types of delivery systems and use what works best for them. Take care, Annette""After I had neck surgery my surgeon gave me hydrocodone/APAP and it didn<APO>t really do the job. I finally asked him for a referral to PT, they really fixed my pain. My neck/shoulder muscles were tighter than they had ever been and the spasms really hurt. It was continuous until they used electrical stimulation to overamp the muscles so they would relax. That fixed my problem with pain completely. Surgeons are not good with pain management, if your pain persists I would see a pain management specialist. Take care, Annette""We have two dogs, both rescued, one from from the pound and the other from the SPCA. They are mutts, no one knows what kind of dogs they are really. They are both small, one about 10 pounds and the other about 20 pounds. They are great companions. One is really smart and learns tricks fast, the other one took three months just to learn how to sit on command. She isn<APO>t too bright, but she is adorable. Hugs, Annette""You need to see a doctor. Look for a free/low cost clinic in your area or try the ER if you think you might have a dislocated shoulder. After you are seen in the ER, you can call the hospital business office and ask what kind of programs they have for the medically indigent. They can usually do anything from discounting your bill up to 100% to giving you a payment plan. If they ask you to put it on a credit card, don<APO>t do that. Ask for an interest free payment plan at least. Take care, Annette""My doctor must have missed the class that your doctor went to. I take opiates, and ambien and have for the last 15 years or so. Prozac too, before that. I have never had any problem mixing them. Constipation can be treated, many drugs cause that. What kind of a doctor other than a VA doctor doesn<APO>t have a DEA license? What diagnosis have they given you so far? If you can only see her, then you have to do whatever she wants, I guess. I take ambien, gabapentin, and opiate pain meds right now, along with some over-the-counter meds. I have had the same doctor now for about 12 years. Take care, Annette""You choose to live where you do even though you always complain about how far away everything is, I am not sure why you live way out there. I know you own a business out there, but maybe it is time to give it up and move closer to the health care you and your husband use, let alone things like libraries. I used to live out in the sticks, now I choose not to. I need to have certain services available to me without driving for miles and miles to get them. I used to live where it snowed a LOT in the winter, it was beautiful, but when I could not dig out my driveway anymore, we moved to where snow is rarely a problem. We all make choices in our lives. Many libraries out in the boonies have outreach programs so folks in the distance can borrow books though a book mobile or even by mail. I used to live out in the sticks like that, I would bundle all my errands into one trip when we ""went to town"" once or twice a month. There was no going to the store for a gallon of milk, we did without. My husband recently bought me a ""Kindle"" electronic book, I don<APO>t need a library or a book store. It is the size of a paperback book and downloads entire books in less than a minute from a list of thousands of titles. You can subscribe to newspapers and magazines also if you wish. There is no monthly fee, you just pay as you go for the books you order. The priciest one so far has been about $10, the cheapest one less than $4. I plug it in to charge up the battery, but I can take it anywhere because it is so small. The battery lasts for hours and hours. I love it. It was well worth the initial investment he paid for it. You also have computer access, you can learn anything with books and a computer. It is up to you. Take care, Annette""No one is judging anyone based on the punctuation or grammar skills. No one is being put down for what they cannot fix. Twenty or thirty lines of words without commas, periods, or paragraphs makes for very difficult reading. I want to be able to help people when I can. However, my chronic pain condition limits the amount of time I can spend sitting at my computer. So, I don<APO>t always read and respond to those posts that are written in one long, long run on sentence and are very hard to decipher. I move on to posts that are easier to read. I hate to not respond to someone who could use a kind word. I am just making suggestions to the other members so I can respond to their concerns. Anyone who doesn<APO>t care if I answer their posts can ignore this thread entirely. Take care, Annette""I adore my Kindle. It is very light, so no problem reading in bed. It comes with a leather cover like a book cover, you can leave that on or take it off as you wish. When you open the cover, it only has one reading surface, you push a button at the bottom to get the next page, or you can push another button to go back a page. It also has a key board, for taking notes, etc. I haven<APO>t used all the different features yet, it has more than I will probably ever use, including a search feature that connects you to the internet. It includes a dictionary for looking up words in the text as you go along, or you can download a different dictionary if you prefer. I increased the font size for my best print size. It could go larger, or smaller than the one I opt to use. It does not strain my eyes as it is not a back lit screen, it is like reading print on a page. You do need light to read it by. Moving is never a simple choice. I know from experience. I lived near Reno where it snows much of the winter. We ended up moving primarily due to my health issues. We loved living there, but the cold in the winter was too much for my pain. I could not dig out the snow anymore, my son had moved away, and my hubby already worked long, hard hours at his job. I had horses that I had to sell because I could no longer care for them as well as they deserved. Living out in the sticks was great for me for many years, I had hoped to never have to live in the city again. But it didn<APO>t work out that way. We have forged a very nice life where we are now with its own advantages and disadvantages I wasn<APO>t telling Laurie what to do, she is always mentioning how far it is to go anywhere for her and how difficult it is for her to travel. She has said that keeping the business going is almost too much for her, and that she has thought about getting on disability at some point. It was just something for her to think about or dismiss. The wonderful thing about message boards is you never have to do anything anyone suggests, lol. No hurt feelings. Hugs, Annette""I hope when you get your Kindle you enjoy it as much as I do mine. Hugs, Annette""I agree and would add that it really helps if you make proper paragraphs. Putting everything in one long post is confusing, and I often skip those posts. If you just double hit the ""enter"" button on your computer after each concern, it will split up your post into paragraphs. I would be happy if everyone just split up their post into paragraphs where they have different issues or concerns. Take care, Annette""Lots of people had to quit school for a variety of reasons or went to school but were never taught correct grammar and punctuation. There are adult literacy classes available in many communities. I volunteered in one once. It was for both English as a second language folk and also for people who just wanted to improve there reading and writing skills. Grammar book are also available at your local library or book store or on line. My son started using a computer and typing everything in the third grade. Unfortunately, this left him with third grade handwriting, not good, lol. When he was overseas in the Marines he had down time with nothing to do, so I sent him a handwriting book and told him to practice, lol. He did a lot of reading over there and had a buddy tutor him in math, his weakest subject. He improved himself in a lot of ways scholastically. It is great that you are learning into adulthood, we should all do that. Take care, Annette""I would see a neurologist and get his opinion. I had a bad disc in my neck that caused similar symptoms. There are a number of treatments to try. We cannot diagnose your symptoms of course, you need to find a good doctor to manage your pain. Take care, Annette""I also have FMS. I have found that the best medical info for the diagnosis and treatment of FMS is at http://www.myalgia.com . Do your research, once you know more about it, it won<APO>t be so scary. Take care, Annette""Tramadol is not an NSAID and neither is Tylenol. Ibuprofen and Aleve are examples of NSAIDs you can buy over the counter. Tramadol withdrawals are uncomfortable, similar to opiate withdrawals I believe. It is normal to have them if you go off of the recommended daily dose abruptly. Better to taper off slowly. Take care, Annette""Actually, the maximum dose of tramadol is 400 mg. per day according to my drug handbook. Not everyone has terrible withdrawal symptoms from tramadol, I didn<APO>t have any when I stopped taking it after many years of using it. I agree that it is best to try all non-opiate meds before going in that direction, but I would go to pain management doctors who use all forms of pain control early on, rather than after trying everything with your pcp. Unless of course, you feel confident that he knows what he is doing. Take care, Annette""I knew it affected serotonin, I did not know about the effect on norepinepherine. My old doctor told me to be careful using it with other serotonin affecting drugs to avoid serotonin syndrome/storm. In the olden days, opiates were used for depression, now we have better drugs. I think there are better drugs to use for depression than tramadol. Take care, Annette""And there are those of us who believe the Bible was written by a bunch of men, and the books chosen to be in the Bible were chosen by the Roman Catholic Church, also a bunch of men. Be a nun, do good works, but think outside the box they provide, and you will be attacked by the Roman Catholic Church. I have a life of peace and joy and do not have a relationship with Jesus Christ. I do not think that God has the time or the inclination to mess with individual people<APO>s lives. I can<APO>t believe that he ""allows suffering for His own sovereign reasons"". I guess it takes all kinds to make up this world of ours. Don<APO>t discount the rest of us though. Take care, Annette""It would be nice if everyone felt like you did. As long as anyone wants to compare the Bible to an unfinished symphony, I say go for it. However, many ""Christians"", especially Evangelicals and born-again Christians, believe in the Bible word for word as the final word of God, and believe the rest of us are going to Hell. Not everyone believes in God, let alone Jesus as his son. This is not the place for religious comparisons or discussions. I can deal with someone saying ""God bless you"", or ""I will pray for you."". Past that, I do have issues. Take care, Annette""Tramadol and tylenol are not NSAIDs, ibuprofen and naproxen are examples of NSAIDs. Tylenol is considered a miscellaneous analgesic. Tramadol is in a class by itself right now, it is indicated for moderate to moderately severe pain. My drug handbook classifies it as a type of opioid since it acts on the opioid receptors in the nervous system. The withdrawal syndrome is similar to that of opiates, even when taking it as prescribed. Take care, Annette""Please take your Christian dogma and discuss it elsewhere. The old testament also tells us to kill our children if they are disrespectful to their parents, not to eat shell fish or pork, etc. Prove this stuff to be true? It is on you, not me. Take care, Annette""Please do not pray for me. You do not know what I believe or do not believe because I don<APO>t discuss it here. ""Christians"" like you and some others are why. I am not angry. WebMD has a Prayer and Spirituality Board, or at least they used to. If you do not wish to post there, do whatever you want to. Again with saying that no one can prove the Bible is inaccurate, I do not feel any need to do so. Can you say you can prove it is accurate? Beyond your faith that it is so, I doubt it. Take care, Annette""I also have FMS. I do not take any of the antidepressants anymore due to the horrible side effects I had with them. Terrible memory loss, etc. I have used the patches that you put over the worst places, mine are called Lidoderm patches, they are impregnated with lidocaine. I find them helpful as a part of my treatment, but they are very expensive. Perhaps there is a generic available now. I found gabapentin to work well for me also, I take 800 mg. once a day a few hours before bedtime. Opiates for pain, and zolpidem for sleep. That combo has worked for me for years now. I see my pcp for all me health needs including my pain management. She had me see a pain management specialist this last year just as a consult to see if we were missing anything. He was very happy with my treatment. I know how many people feel about exercise, but I have found it is a very important part of my treatment program. If anything it causes more pain afterwards, but my doctor prescribes meds for that. Globally, I do feel a lot better when I exercise, so I do about an hour and a half a day. Not like the old days of my youth, but moderate exercise that I worked up to very slowly. My favorite FMS site is http://www.myalgia.com for good medical and treatment information. It is not a message board, but rather a place to do research. Take care, Annette""I would just take research articles from peer reviewed medical journals and ask him what he thinks about them. I would not be confrontational, just ask. Maybe he will learn something and be more willing to try a long acting med with a breakthrough med like most doctors do. I would search on Medscape for abstracts and go from there. Take care, Annette""I didn<APO>t get that part of his post either, I just responded the best I could. Take care, Annette""It is terrible that the doctor you trusted with your health has betrayed you like this. It is certainly not your fault that you are in this situation, hopefully you will find another doctor who will manage your health issues. In my medical reference book, thoughts of suicide are not mentioned as part of opiate withdrawal. I can certainly see how your depression would be made worse by your situation. I would make an appt. to see a therapist or a psychiatrist as soon as possible to manage your depression. Meanwhile you might get a book about cognitive behavioral therapy and see what you can do for yourself. I don<APO>t know how long it will take for you to get the health care that you need. Find a good internist as soon as possible. Going through withdrawal may well make your blood pressure harder to control. Use the ER or an urgent care facility if necessary. Take care, Annette""[TRIGGER] Why would they put you in jail? The ERs I have worked in do not do things like that to patients. If you are serious about killing yourself, call the nearest crisis line or a therapist. There is nothing we can do for you on line, so there really isn<APO>t any point in talking about it every day. Take care, Annette""I just interview a new doc, and see if it seems like we would be a good fit. Cover whatever issues you feel are really important to you. A recommendation from your old doc would be a great place to start. If you have gone three (now four) full days with no meds, the worse of any withdrawals has already started. Take care, Annette""There is a difference between addiction and dependence. People who are addicted take drugs for other than what they were prescribed for, and become compulsive about taking them regardless of negative outcomes. People who are in pain rarely develop addiction, less than one percent, according to the latest study I<APO>ve read. They do become dependent, and will go through withdrawals if they are suddenly without their meds, as you have discovered. I do not know if you are addicted or not, I am pretty certain you are dependent on opiates according to what you have told us. Addiction is always possible, but not probable in chronic pain patients. My point with your posts thus far is that you nearly always mention killing yourself, you are getting a lot of attention for that reason. However, you don<APO>t seem to be doing anything about it, like calling a crisis line or seeing a doctor regarding your depression and other health issues. You can<APO>t fix anything if you are dead, so I consider that the main objective at this point in time. I think that trumps controlling your pain or your withdrawals, although I think that they are issues that also need addressing. BUT, WE CANNOT DO THAT FOR YOU. By the way, I worked with a doctor in the ER that had chronic back pain, he worked in spite of it for many years. He finally had the surgery and it did fix his pain, unusual, but true. His take on the whole pain thing was that if he could work in that kind of pain without opiates, then other patients should not be complaining about not getting opiates for their chronic pain. It had the exact opposite effect than folks here think it might have. Oh, well.... Take care, Annette PS, Call a crisis line or an MD regarding your suicidal feelings.""Anon<UD>1208, I never accused you of being an addict. If no therapist will see you call a crisis line, do to a university clinic, there are lots of ways around a low income, many people with mental health issues are low income. I have never had a doctor who worried about me becoming an addict rather than giving me pain meds. If I were a doctor I would not give you pain meds except under strict supervision due to your previous drug/alcohol use and suicide attempts. I have known doctors who prescribed the meds that people used to commit suicide with, and the doctors suffered guilt for years. I am only two years older than you are, so we grew up about the same time. Drinking and driving was not acceptable where I grew up, except by people who drank and drove and wanted an exception made for them. I partied in bars for years, drinking only soda or OJ. I knew I had to drive home and didn<APO>t want to do it drunk. I am not going to respond to any more posts of yours that mention suicide or suicide attempts. Get the help you need. Take care, Annette""You need to learn to control your intake of pain meds so that you don<APO>t run out early. Take them exactly the way they are prescribed. Ask the doctor for a referral to another doctor if he cannot help you decrease your pain. Perhaps you need a pain management specialist to intervene for you. Do you have someone who can hold you accountable by watching your intake of meds, day to day, instead of monthly like the doctor does? Maybe see an addiction specialist to see if you are addicted or if you are just trying to decrease your pain? There is a condition called pseudo-addiction, worth looking into with the help of a good doctor. Take care, Annette""Very well said, Trudy. It is great when you find a doctor who really cares and manages your pain properly. Take care, Annette""I have had surgery on one disc in my neck that was causing motor function problems. It is really not shown to be all that effective in relieving pain. My neurosurgeon said it was about a 50/50 chance of some improvement in pain. He would not do spinal surgery for pain alone at all, he said the risks were too great. He only did surgery for functional deficits. I waited two years before I started really losing the use of my right hand. Then I had the surgery, just a discectomy, no surgical fusion. Six months later the disc above the surgical site herniated, I did not have surgery for that one as I did not lose function. After a couple of years, it was at least as good as the surgical site. I threw a blood clot after the surgery and my hospital stay went from 2 days to 7, and I was on blood thinners for six months. No fun at all. Not worth risking again for better odds. Best of luck to you, whatever you do. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t understand why you don<APO>t want to switch to a long acting med? Medically it is a better choice, I would at least give it a try. When you take a long acting med on a set schedule, you don<APO>t have the ups and downs of your blood level that you have with your current short acting meds. Taking a high dose of hydrocodone/APAP vs. a low dose of a long acting med is six of one and a half dozen of the other. You should still be able to take care of your daughter either way. Once your body has adapted to the meds you should have less pain, but you should not feel sedated or lethargic. You do have to remember that the acetaminophen in the lortab can harm your liver, so you have to be very careful not to exceed the recommended dosage. If the injections do not help you, I would decline to have any more. I think you should be open to trying other things though. I really believe that if you get a small amount of relief from each of a variety of things, the total amount of relief is worthwhile. Take care, Annette""I am a born cynic and totally agree with you about the cost of injections and procedures making the doctors a lot more $$$ than an office visit and adjustment of oral meds. All drugs can cause problems in the wrong hands. I would only let a doctor with a lot of experience with prescribing methadone manage my meds. A part of the cause of the death rate is that patients treat methadone like the other opiates, and think if one is good then two might be better. It does not work the same way, so overdose is much more common. That said, I have been taking it for about a year now with no problems at all. Same dose as when I started, decent relief. I am not complaining. Take care, Annette""I have been taking methadone for about a year now, and have not had any of the side effects you mentioned. I am at a far lower dose though, that may make a difference. You have to start with a very low dose and work upwards very slowly to the best dose for you, often the doctor must finally decrease the dose at the very end of the titration process, as it builds up in your system due to the long half life. It is also very important to get a baseline EKG, and then get one yearly to monitor your heart. It can cause cardiac abnormalities in a very few people, but if you catch it, you just change drugs and it will go back to normal. I discussed it with a pain management specialist, even though my pcp manages my pain meds, just to be sure we had covered all our bases. I agree that no one should take any benzos (Xanax, ativan, valium, klonopin, etc.) along with any opiates. I believe it is a bad mix. I took a pain management class for healthcare professionals a year or two ago and the instructor said that the latest research said mixing opiates and benzos is a bad idea, and she said not to do it. She believed that soon doctors simply will not prescribe the two at the same time. I worked at a methadone clinic for addicts 40 years ago and we saw problems back then and asked our clients not to use benzos while they were on our methadone program. We also screened for them on the urine screens, just to be sure. All drugs have the potential to do harm, so you are absolutely correct in telling people to do their research, and be very careful. I do that for all drugs I take, not just pain meds. I am so glad you have resolved your problems and moved on to a different drug with a better side effect profile for you. Take care, Annette""They are 16 and 4 1/2. Both boys and great kids. It is good to see you posting, I was a bit worried about you when I didn<APO>t see any posts from you the other day. Take care, Annette""Thanks, Dave Take care, Annette""Thanks, Caprice. It is always worth the pain and fatigue later if I go to visit family. I get to fly down there once a year for Xmas, and I love it. We keep in touch by phone and on Facebook, but it is not the same as seeing them. Take care, Annette""I had a great time with my son and his family, but I am glad to be home. It may take me awhile to recover, but it is so worth it. Being with my son, his wife and their two kids for the holiday was just so nice. She was accepted into a USC Master<APO>s program in Social Work with an emphasis on Veteran<APO>s Affairs. She has already started. I am so proud of her. I am exhausted and my sleep cycles are all messed up. That is why I am posting at 4 am, lol. I missed you all. Where is Beth? I didn<APO>t see any posts from her, I will check more tomorrow when I am more awake. Take care, Annette""I tried acupuncture for FMS, it did not work for me. I went faithfully for about 8 weeks without any response at all. But we are all different, I would give it a try, it works for many people. Take care, Annette""I bought the Bible on audio tapes some years back for a patient who no longer had the vision to read herself. It brought her great comfort and enabled her to keep up with her Bible classes. Take care, Annette""Hi, Beth The housekeeper idea is worth it. I actually had a job for nine years that included a house keeping service every two weeks for three hours, two women would come. It was the best perk I ever had while I was working. Before that I paid for it myself. I just made a list of what I wanted done with number one being the most important, they just worked their way down the list until the three hours was up. I opted for the living areas and the kitchen and bathrooms to be done and then the little bit of ironing that I had because I hated that. My son was young then and I made him clean his own room, lol, good training for his later life. Now that I am not working, I have opted not to have a house keeper. I do the best I can, my husband never complains. Do it, and enjoy it. Take care, Annette PS, I don<APO>t do New Year<APO>s Resolutions.""That depends on what kind of allergic reaction you had to the other meds. I would discuss it with a doctor or pharmacist. Take care, Annette""I use all generic meds so that I won<APO>t end up in the dreaded donut hole of Medicare Part D. I take four RX meds and my total cost for the year was a little over $1400. That was on the plain old Medicare Part D with an AARP program. This year I will be on an AARP Medicare Advantage program. I switched to methadone for long acting pain from a generic long acting morphine. It costs less than $15 a month, I take it three times a day, so I need 90 pills a month. You might talk to your doctor about changing to a cheaper medicine. Be up front with him that now you have to pay for your meds and the Oxycontin is just too expensive. Be glad the year is nearly over. Then you get to start over and you won<APO>t be in the donut hole anymore. Take care, Annette""Does the Cymbalta help? If so, why go off of it? Be very careful with meds, especially new ones. You are at an age where falls frequently happen. Falls can be deadly if you break a hip or something like that. Does it really matter what caused your neuropathy? You have to deal with it now. Keep your blood sugars within a normal range to the neuropathy does not get worse. Have you tried cognitive behavioral therapy for the depression? I have used it and found it to be very useful. I cured my depression using its techniques. No harmful side effects either. Take care, Annette""I saw her husband on TV talking about this. He said she wasn<APO>t with it at all, and did not even know what was going on. Sad. Take care, Annette""Have you traveled to a university medical center for a consultation with specialists to make sure you are not skipping any treatments with your liver and kidneys? It is worth it, I think. We have all done it at some point in our lives in my family. A good pharmacist on your team is also a valuable asset. I have had several that did research on my behalf to make sure that I was on the proper meds for my condition. Take care, Annette""It can be deadly for a number of reasons in the elderly. Broken hips rarely happen in young folk in my experience. The elderly may have other medical conditions that make surgery more dangerous, like diabetes, or hypertension, or heart disease. If they survive the surgery they often seem to have neurological/cognitive deficits. Or as Swank says, they just seem to ""fade away"". If your grandmother has fallen and had several hip surgeries and has come through mentally and physically intact, then she is very lucky. Did she break her hip due to a fall, of were her hip surgeries for some other reason? I would ask a home health nurse to do a safety check of her home, with her permission of course. They are trained to spot things like throw rugs and a lack of hand rails in the bathroom, along with medication side effects that might contribute to falls. There is quite a list that we used to go over with a client to make the home as safe as possible. As a retired RN, it has always been my worse fear to fall and break a hip. I am only 60, so probably too young for a hip fracture yet, but I had a bone density test at 50 to know what might be in my future. My mom went from wearing 3 inch heels every day of her adult life to wearing sneakers and flats because she worried about going up and down her apartment stairs and falling and breaking a hip. Her Achilles tendons had shortened so it took her several years to gradually make the change. My great aunt warned her about such things back before she died, she was a retired RN. I just read a medical study in a nursing journal I get that showed this to be a statistical truth, not just the imaginings of nurses. I love your name, Orchid, it was in a Pearl Buck book I read years ago. Take care, Annette""Of course, losing mobility causes its own group of health problems including independence, but the latest medical study also showed neurological/cognitive changes after a hip fracture with a surgical repair. Take care, Annette""Hi, Beth I am so glad that you are feeling better. I had spinal surgery about 18 years ago. I thought I would just die from the fatigue, I mentioned it to my surgeon because I was supposed to go back to work 6 weeks post op in the ER doing 12 hour shifts. I couldn<APO>t even do the grocery shopping at 4 weeks post op, I would nearly fall asleep walking down the aisles. He told me the anesthesia that they used attached itself to fat cells (I have lots of those, lol) and was then released again slowly into the blood stream and out of the body through the kidneys. That caused the fatigue. He told me it would go away by the 6 week mark. It did. I don<APO>t know if that applies to you, they may use entirely different meds now. But, then again they may still attach themselves to the fat cells, who knows? Talk to your doctor. Surgery of any kind is also a great trauma to the body. We deserve to feel a bit tired. It takes time to recover. Take care, Annette""I, on the other hand, had a single level cervical discectomy and threw a clot and ended up on coumadin for six months. I was in the hospital an extra five days for the clot. This scared me far more than the spinal surgery. My neurosurgeon just said this was one of the less common adverse reactions to spinal surgery. After all of it was over, the benefits were great, my function came back completely in my right hand, which was why I had the surgery to start with. When another cervical disc herniated six months later, also a common problem, I declined surgery. The pain went away on its own, I never developed any functional deficits. If it happened again, I would decline surgery and see what happens. The cause of my problems in my neck was different than Beth<APO>s, our basic state of health was different, and our meds etc. were different to begin with. Every case is different, and the possible risk/benefits ratio is different. Discuss all of this with your surgeon and decide what to do. Spinal surgery due to non-traumatic problems is rarely an emergency so hopefully, you will have plenty of time to think it over. Take care, Annette""I am not sure exactly where you are having pain in your lower back/tailbone area, but they do a lumbr puncture in the lower back and that can leave some pain that will usually go away after a few weeks. It sounds like they did things correctly and now you are on the road to recovery. Blood in places where it doesn<APO>t belong can cause a significant amount of inflammation and pain. As long as your headaches are improving, I would just ride it out. Ask for more relief for your pain if necessary. Pain pills are not always the answer, but they are often part of the treatment. My husband had an epidural bleed in his head and the steroids really made the most difference in his symptoms. He was on them for several weeks after being diagnosed. Take care, Annette""[TRIGGER] I agree with Trudy. What you are doing is illegal, and you ARE getting high, the ""buzz"" you mentioned is the effect that you seem to like so much. No doctor should prescribe opiates to you unless you have a medical condition that warrants using opiates, the same as any other kind of medicine. What doctor will believe that you won<APO>t cheat on how much you use? You are already using illegal drugs? Perhaps you should move to a country where drugs are already decriminalized, I don<APO>t see it happening here in the near future. I would like to know how old you are and what your current daily dose is? Of course, you don<APO>t have to disclose personal info like that if you don<APO>t feel comfortable doing so. Your tolerance level will go up as you continue to use, you will need more of the drug to get the same level of ""buzz"" that you get now. If you are pretty young, your dose will soon be more than any doctor will give you a prescription for, even if you did have pain. All doctors have their own upper limit of what they will prescribe. Best of luck to you, please see a therapist or go to NA for help when you decide you have a problem. Take care, Annette""[TRIGGER] I worked as an RN at a multiple modality heroin addiction treatment center many years ago, back in the early 1970s. Methadone was one of the options we gave people. I know people personally that have used methadone to get off of illegal drugs, and moved on to a drug free life. It takes hard work, there is no way around that. Addiction is a tough illness to treat. It is actually illegal for you to get methadone from your family doctor to treat addiction for more than three days while he is seeking definitive care at an approved addiction facility. It is legal for a doctor to prescribe it for chronic pain, but not addiction. Your friend<APO>s doctor could potentially put his medical license in jeopardy. Please don<APO>t jeopardize a MDs license, they have worked hard to get it to begin with. Please try a treatment program, no one gets off of an addiction without serious help. Chasing drugs on the street takes far more time and energy than dropping into a treatment facility once a day. Most treatment facilities will give you ""take home doses"" after you are in treatment successfully for awhile, so you won<APO>t have to go every day. You need therapy in addition to drug replacement. Are you attending any NA programs? They are free and available to anyone. The 12 step programs have one of the best success rates in treating alcoholism and other addictions. Take care, Annette""[TRIGGER] I am so sorry that you lost your wife. Addiction is hard to treat, and affects the entire family, as you found out. Take care, Annette""Fibro definitely makes pain worse, no matter where it is. It is a disorder of pain amplification. Has your doctor suggested you time your pain meds about an hour before the dressing is changed? That might help, although nothing will make it painless. The air hitting the open wound when the dressing is changed causes pain, as does all the fussing with it that the nurse does to pack it and cover it. Once it is closed to the air again the pain should be less. The doctor should accept the patients description of the pain, as only the patient knows how bad it hurts. That is pain management 101, first rule. Hope you feel better soon. Take care, Annette""Why do you assume you have to change opiates or increase doses every 4-6 months? I have gone several years between changes, as have other people. I would pay attention to your symptoms, and see if there are other things you can do. Either other non-opiate meds, or other non-drug treatments. If you cannot control your meds any other way, your doctor should know what to do about it. Take care, Annette""I never assume someone is taking more than prescribed!!! I didn<APO>t think that of you for a second. All you mentioned in your first post was opiates, so I didn<APO>t know if you had tried other treatments yet. If you have tried every thing non-opiate, then I would trust your doctor to choose a medicine for you, he knows you far better than we do. Take care, Annette""Thanks, everyone. I appreciate all your good thoughts and best wishes. This is indeed a happy surgery, if there is one. The surgeon is well recommended and the hospital is a breast center, so I will be in good hands. I am not afraid of increased pain for awhile, I know I can deal with that. So far I have never met a woman who had this kind of surgery that regretted having it. Take care, Annette""My surgeon<APO>s office called and said the insurance company (a Medicare Advantage outfit) has approved my surgery, and we scheduled it for Jan. 19th. I seriously need a breast reduction, I have for many years, but it was never the right time for another surgery. My pcp said it might help my back and shoulder pain. I have jumped through all the hoops, I had a mammogram, saw a hematologist (I had a blood clot after my last surgery), and a pain management specialist. Everything came back good, and they said there is no reason I should not go ahead with the surgery. I saw my pcp the day before for a routine visit, and I had lost 5 more pounds since my last visit 2 months before. That is nice, but I am not sure why I lost weight, I ate plenty at my son<APO>s house over the holiday. I have lost about 45 pounds altogether, a good thing. Think good thoughts for me on the 19th. Take care, Annette""Thanks, Dave. A Happy New Year<APO>s to you also. Take care, Annette""Don<APO>t act like a nurse, and diagnose and treat yourself. I do it all the time, lol. Just kidding, I am sure you have discussed this with one of your doctors. When my husband developed this in one hand, he was still working as a big truck mechanic and refused surgery. His doctor suggested he get a brace with a metal splint in the wrist/palm and wear it at night for at least six weeks, and take NSAIDs (no GI bleeding history). He has done that off and on for many years with good results. He never would take any time off from work to rest or have surgery of course. I have had a Kindle for several years, since they first came out, I adore it. Enjoy your Nook. Hugs, Annette""Yes, you did the right thing. The best way to avoid all this drama is to keep all your med bottles locked in a lock box or a small safe. The cops can<APO>t get you for diversion or ""allowing"" your meds to be taken by others that way. Also simply do not tell anyone you take any controlled substances. This also makes it safer if you have children visiting your home for any reason. I always lock all my meds up when I visit my son and his family in my suitcase. I keep the key in my pocket. I am so glad to hear that you made it through until it was time for your med RXs to be written. So many people post and we never hear form them again. Please write at least one more time and tell me your meds, including over the counter ones, are safely locked up. Take care, Annette""Folks know all the ""hidey-holes"" others use to hide their meds. You already confronted her about the meds and she denied it. I would file a police report immediately. All you do is tell them the truth about what happened and who all was at your house. You respond to their questions truthfully and completely. The detective work is up to them. Your step daughter and what ever consequences happen are not your responsibility, but hers. Get a copy of the police report and have them fax one to your doctor. Most pain management doctors will take care of their patients once for this kind of thing. Don<APO>t let it happen again. I recommend that everyone keep their meds locked up with a real lock. You can buy something special like cwu007 suggested or use a small tackle/tool box and a padlock if you have one laying around. Tell your doctor that you have got your meds under lock and key now and promise there won<APO>t be a repeat of what happened. Your step daughter needs help that you cannot provide, as long as folks let her get away with this kind of behavior she won<APO>t change. Maybe she will if she has to deal with the consequences of her behavior. That is up to her. Take care, Annette""I would deal with the insurance issue first. Clear up the mistake, then ask for a list of PTs that are covered under her insurance. If she is free to see anyone, then ask her doctor for a referral. Her doctor probably works with a certain PT group most of the time. Take care, Annette""My son found that the level of disability rating really made a difference as far as getting access to medical care from the VA. He was an active duty Marine for eight years, and did three combat deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq. When he went up from a 60% to 90% disability rating it seemed to change everything for him. My experience as a nurse is that it all seems to depend on where you live. Some VA hospitals are great, some are not. My personal thanks to all the military people who have given so freely for the rest of us. Take care, Annette""I would suggest you read the book, ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"" by Dr. Margaret A. Caudill, MD, PhD. I use the techniques in it daily to manage the chronic pain I have. It sounds like both you and your husband have some difficulty expressing your feelings to each other. Maybe a family therapist could help the two of you for some limited issues. Take care, Annette""I am glad that you are comfortable with your current pain levels and are able to treat them with over the counter meds. There is no need to go through unbearable withdrawals, your doctor should be able to manage a taper for you that will minimize any withdrawal symptoms. I disagree with the term addiction, I feel that dependence is more accurate. Unless you were taking your opiates to get high or for some reason other than pain, addiction is not the right word to use. Switching those words around is a common thing, but gives people the wrong idea about how opiates work. Take care, Annette""What are you currently doing about the leg length discrepancy? As long as they are different lengths you will probably have pain of some sort as your body has to make up for the difference. It throws your whole body off kilter. My husband have AVN of one hip and lost length in that leg, 1 inch when he finally had a hip replacement. The doctor managed to even out the length when he did the hip surgery. He wore shims in his shoes before the surgery to make walking easier, but he never went for a proper fitting, he just added heels pads as his leg got shorter. If you haven<APO>t been fitted with proper prosthetics to wear in your shoes, I would look into that for a start. You may have to do exercises for the rest of your life. Until the doctors come up with another plan, I would just settle in and do it. I am not sure what you wanted the doctor to do for you if you left town immediately for a month. You have to tell him that your pain is too much for you to tolerate at this point, do not leave the office unless you feel comfortable with your treatment plan. Take care, Annette""Maybe three hours is too much for you right now. Maybe if you break up your errands so you don<APO>t have to do so much at once, you will have less pain. I started out with a 30/30 rule, active for 30 minutes, then rest for 30 minutes. I have also found that using my BT meds before I get to that high level of pain helps. I will take a dose about 30-60 minutes prior to activity, then again 4-6 hours later if needed. You might discuss this with your doctor and see what he recommends. Take care, Annette""I have a similar health history. My weight has gone up and down over the years. I finally decided to just ignore the weight, and eat reasonably and exercise every day. I am learning to belly dance with the help of a TV show and DVDs. I am up to at least an hour a day, sometimes two hours. Although I have some cravings for carbs, I resist it and allow myself one dish of ice cream a day in the evening. It is something to look forward to. I do not recommend allowing yourself to feel ""starving"", go ahead and eat regular portions of healthy food. Discuss any unusual (for you) food cravings with your doctor, they may be related to meds that you can change, only you and the doc can decide that. I do not believe in ""dieting"", just find a good healthy way of eating. Keep up with the walking, even when it hurts. You can break it down to three ten minutes sessions of walking if that hurts less. Exercise for folks with FMS is different than it is for folks without FMS. We have to start slow and increase really slowly. Discuss this with your doctor too. My former doctor did it in minutes, not the length of the walk, he said to work up to at least 30 min. a day on most days. He said it really didn<APO>t matter to him if I did it in smaller sessions, several times a day. I have found that even if exercise seems to cause a slight increase in pain, I do feel better all around than if I don<APO>t exercise. Laying still feels good until you move, I am so stiff and sore if I have been watching TV for awhile and then get up and move around. My doctor is willing to increase my pain meds if needed, she says that ""no one should decrease their activity due to increased pain"". She is a good person and a good doctor. It is part of FMS that we don<APO>t feel refreshed after what seems like a good night<APO>s sleep. I haven<APO>t felt that way but once in the last 15 years. Just stretch, exercise, and get moving. Do the best you can, that is all you can ask of yourself. Take care, Annette""Try to get up out of bed and move around no matter how bad you feel. I think it is generally better for you than staying in bed too much. I think we all have something to hate about ourselves. While my son was overseas on deployment, I decided to let that stuff go, be glad I was alive, and get on with my life. Best decision I ever made. Take care, Annette""To: Anon-1208 According to the Catholic Church, people who commit suicide don<APO>t get to go to heaven. This is what I was taught years ago, they may have changed their mind since then. They have changed a lot of other things. All that means is no one really knows what happens next, other than it is permanent. The problem you are having now is temporary, you can help yourself along the path wherever it goes. I would call your insurance company if you need to, and start calling doctors who might actually see you. We can all talk about what to do, but you have to do it yourself. No one here can do it for you. It was a good step to try the methadone clinic, now try doctor<APO>s offices and find a pcp. If nothing else a pcp can help you get through withdrawals and help you find a pain management doctor. Take care, Annette""Hi, Dave I have to agree with the other two who posted ahead of me. Although I tend to not bother to read religious stuff, I went back and re-read it. It is very ambiguous, I am not certain the poster even knows what she is to believe. She did include ""What if you take your own life or just up and die?"" It seemed to me that she thought the same about either one. I do not consider suicide a terrible sin, I decided long ago to let any God that may exist make these kind of judgments him/herself. I believe that anyone who gets to the point of suicide has been somewhere dark and difficult. I have gotten to the point of considering it an option, but I never acted on it. Scared I guess. I have taken care of too many suicide attempts, unsuccessful ones. Most of those people regretted it later, but not because it was sinful. I have cared for folks who shot themselves, overdosed, drank Drano, etc. They ended up paying for it in the end, but alive. They were glad to be alive when I took care of them, after they got over being angry that someone saved them. I don<APO>t think hisfaithful1 had any ill feelings and tried his/her best to counsel this person. I just don<APO>t think we are qualified to do so. Anon<UD>1208 needs to see a doctor right away, not waste time talking about this so much on line. We all have an opinion here, but that is our reality, not necessarily someone elses. Take care, Annette""All I can say is rest as much as the doctor tells you to so that bone has the best chance to heal. DO NOT SMOKE, as that will surely keep a bone fracture from healing. Take care, Annette""I know you hate the medical profession in general, at least that is my take on your posts. That said, I have never seen anyone ask for a consent to do surgery while the patient is sedated. I am not saying it has never been done, I am pretty sure it has been, but it is not a legal consent, and both the doctor and the hospital want to cover their butts legally. If it is an emergency and the patient cannot sign for himself due to his physical and/or mental condition, the doctor can sign the consent himself and ask another doctor to co-sign. I am having elective surgery myself on the 19th and I have an appt. tomorrow that includes signing the consent. My doctor has told me the risks and possible benefits and I have decided to have surgery. Long ago when I went to have my tubes tied, I crossed out the part you are talking about, where you basically let them do whatever they want in case that doctor feels it is necessary. I told the pre-op RN that I would own the doctor and the hospital if they opted to do more than tie my tubes during this surgery, as the doctor had not discussed anything more with me. You can do that if you want and the doctor will often still do the surgery as requested. Mine did. 99% of the time we agree with each other. I enjoy reading your posts. Take care, Annette""No apology needed. I know that the profession has bad apples in it, and I really hate it when someone is not treated properly. As long as there are other opinions to balance things out, I don<APO>t think it is an issue. Everyone has their own opinion. You certainly have a right to feel the way you do. Take care, Annette""Beth had good info for you. The only thing I can add is to discuss with your human resources dept. the FMLA benefit. My sister used it to take her son to his PT appts. So I do know you can use it intermittently, rather than all at once if you need to. I schedule my doctor appts. well in advance, so I do get late afternoon appts. Can you make up lost time some time during the week? Take care, Annette""Actually, percocet is considered stronger than hydrocodone/APAP when the dose is the same, as yours is. A very few people will have better pain relief with the hydrocodone than with the percocet at the same dose, but it is rare. Withdrawal would not happen and the symptoms would be different. Side effects of a new med often will go away after a few weeks to a couple of months. Call your doctor<APO>s office and make an appt. to see him and let him help you try and figure this out. Take care, Annette""Hi, Beth I really do understand as best anyone can what you are going through. I am a nurse too, and thought once I got my son through college I would save for my retirement. But I got ill too. My son went into the Marines, and I became disabled, nearly 12 years ago. I live on SSDI and of course, my husband pays his share. I thought I was ready to give up my RN license, but when push came to shove, I wasn<APO>t. I lost my Oregon RN license last year because their rules say you have to continue to work or volunteer 4-5 hours a week (that is what it comes out as after you do the math). I volunteered for nine years, and could no longer do two evenings a week. However, I discovered I did not want to give up the dream of going back to work some day. I was originally licensed in California, and they use educational hours for re-licensing. I applied and received an RN through the Calif. system, after doing 30 hours of education. So I am still an RN at least. Had I waited until after my Oregon license expired I would have to retake the NCLEX exam, and I don<APO>t know how I would do on that, lol. My state boards were 40 years ago, some things that nurses take for granted now were not even in existence then. Maybe someday, the experts WILL find an answer for us and we will be able to go back to work, I don<APO>t know, but I do know I am not willing to give up just yet. By studying and reading as much as I can, I am at least of help occasionally. As for the money, as my mom said after daddy died (and left that stay at home mom with five kids), ""You can<APO>t get blood out of a turnip."" She paid off his medical bills from his terminal cancer $20 a month for each one, when one was paid off, she added that $20 to the others. He had no insurance to speak of, and she paid them all off, doctors, and hospitals, and the nursing home where he died. You tell folks you owe money to what your situation is and they end up being really nice most of the time. All you can do is your best. You know what that is, you cannot do anymore than that. I know you would not do anything less than your best. Hugs, Annette""Let<APO>s both keep up our licenses at least! I used to be certified as a CEN and a CCRN. I worked in the ICU/CCU and in the ER towards the end of my career. I let them lapse after I ""retired"". Oh well, can<APO>t do everything, just our best, lol. I am kind of glad they make me do 30 hours of education to renew my license. Keeps me up to date and I do enjoy it. I only have to renew every two years. Hugs, Annette""I suspect you may indeed have panic attacks along with whatever else you have. Muscle spasms happen in skeletal type muscles, not cardiac muscles, even though you feel like you are going to die of a heart attack, it is not a heart attack. Usually the ER gives you a doctor<APO>s name and number for follow-up for after care. You need to establish yourself with a pcp if you do not already have one. This kind of doctor should follow you long term and may be able to diagnose you once and for all. Take care, Annette""I wish I had an answer for you, but all I can do is offer is my caring support. I am sure you already know all the non-drug things to try while you are looking for a doctor. Folks with insurance just do not always understand that if one does not have access to medical care, it just does not matter how good the care is in the US. Have you worked outside the home enough to qualify for SSDI and maybe get Medicare? Take care, Annette""Hi, Beth Those tests are only done for research purposes, not for general diagnosis. The diagnosis is done based on a careful history and physical exam, and tests to rule out all other possible causes of the symptoms. My doc did a UA, CBC, chem panel, thyroid panel, hepatitis panel, HIV test, RA, and ANA for a start. He already had MRIs of my brain and neck due to other conditions. He listened to me carefully, and did a complete physical including a tender point exam for FMS. Being very sensitive to sound may well be due to her FMS, FMS is a syndrome of sensory amplification, usually pain, but also other sensory input. Unrefreshing sleep is another symptom as she has discovered. In addition to coming here, she should check out the FMS Board on this site, Dr. Pelligrino is a great FMS doc, as he has FMS and works as a Physiatrist also. He has written many books on FMS, and has a great sense of humor. He is the medical expert there. Another site for good medical info about FMS is http://www.myalgia.com. It is not interactive but is a great site for solid articles about FMS. My best friend has been there for me for fifty years now, since we were 10. I hope your friendship lasts as long and is as satisfying. I think I am a bit older than you are?? I am sixty. Take care, Annette""Well, we are very close in the length of our friendships, close ones like that are rare these days. I consider both her and her two sisters to be my sisters too. One of her sisters drove 350 miles when my mom died so she could help me if I needed her. My friend also has no children of her own, I have one son and was also single for about ten years of his younger life. I could not have done it without my friend and her sisters. Her mom told me when mine died, that she would step in and be a mom if I needed one and a grandma for my son. That is not even counting my many on line friends, like you. I have been so blessed in my life. Hugs, Annette""How do you come up with 80 mg. and over what period of time do you take 80 mg.? Lortab comes with 5, 7.5, and 10 mg. of hydrocodone per pill mixed with acetaminophen. Which pill are you taking? How many at once? How many hours between doses? How many pills per day? I hope your ""regular"" doctor has put you on a sensible weaning program. Best of luck, Annette""How do you know that the spasm pulls the bottom rib up over the next rib up? How would you tell without an xray? Have you already had it checked out? Yes, I would get it checked out by an MD, while it is happening. Take care, Annette""I would ask your OB-GYN for a referral. Once you establish yourself with a doctor, you will just have to wait until the rib acts up. My husband<APO>s doctor keeps a couple of appt. slots open each day for emergency patients, so does my doctor. For my husband<APO>s doctor you just call in at 7am, and first come first served. I have always been able to get an appt. for that day for him using their system by calling right at 7am. I am always seen the same day by my doctor if I say it is an emergent kind of visit and call first thing in the am. I don<APO>t see why anyone would think you are crazy, you don<APO>t sound crazy. Take care, Annette""I have had the same experience as Swank has. NO ONE has ever treated me badly or with disrespect for taking pain meds. None of the medical professionals I have dealt with, and none of the family and friends I have shared this with. I don<APO>t tell everyone I know about my pain meds, as I do not tell them about other aspects of my health care. I consider it private information. But it is not a big secret either, I just would need a real reason to tell them. I agree with Swank about not letting everyone know about pain meds to avoid them wanting to steal them. I do not keep them in my medicine cabinet, I keep them locked up in another room entirely. Take care, Annette""Ditto what Beth said. I personally think that perhaps you do not really want our advice, you have already come up with reasons that don<APO>t sound reality based for why you should not do anything that might be prescribed. Perhaps you have been looking up things like steroids on line, and really have no idea how they work or what the side effects are. You say you don<APO>t want to ""pop pills"" but you have been taking opiates, benzos, and fioricet which contains a barbiturate for years. I have chronic pain including neck problems and migraines. I have treated my migraines without opiates or benzos or barbiturates for well over 15 years. All of those drugs can cause rebound headaches so be careful. My acupunturist would only use acupuncture once a week for pain, as for massage, you can learn to do it yourself, or have a friend/loved one do it for you. What do you really want to try? I would go see a pain management doctor who uses many different modalities for pain management and at least give his suggestions a try. You may have to also see a headache specialist as some pain management doctors are not trained in managing migraines. But I would start with a PM doc. Take care, Annette""Percocet contains the opiate oxycodone and acetaminophen (Tylenol). I would try discussing this with your doctor. It may be that taking an over the counter pain med might be enough on some nights to deal with a smaller amount of pain that is enough to disturb your sleep, but not enough to really bother you when you are awake.Or even a milder prescription pain med. Take care, Annete""No way of knowing for sure. My great aunt took a single tylenol to help her sleep, no reason scientifically why it would help her sleep, but she believed it would, so it did. She was a retired RN, and she knew the science of it all, but she said she tried going to bed without it, and did not sleep. Neither of these meds is a sleep aid, but my bet would be on the oxycodone. You could ask the doctor to order it without the acetaminophen and see if it still works. Or you could just explain it all to him and see what he thinks. Take care, Annette""keithmcmanus, Tylenol PM contains diphenhydramine (the generic of Benadryl) along with the Tylenol. Taking this drug occasionally is fine, but often if taken daily, you will need more of the drug to help you sleep as well with time. It can also cause a very dry mouth as a side effect. Sleeplessness does not always pass after a few days without meds. For some people it is a life long battle. Some folks have a sleep disorder that requires treatment of some kind. For others, Swank is absolutely correct, it will often pass. Just discus this with your doctor and see what he suggests. Take care, Annette""I had a similiar surgery in the US, just on a different tendon in my wrist. I had no sedation or general anesthetic either. I really don<APO>t recall if he used a tourniquet or not. (It seems to me like he would have, if only to keep blood off the surgical field.) It was done in the out-patient section of my hospital<APO>s OR department. Sedation was going to be given to me, but I asked the RN not to as I wanted to get home faster and without being woozy. There was no anesthesiologist present. When I declined the sedation, I said we did similar procedures in the ER without sedation, just a local anesthetic. I did not see a big difference. The orthopedic surgeon agree and he took a short time to do the surgery, sew me up, and wrap up my hand and splint it. I had my vital signs taken and went home. My husband drove of course. This was done a long time ago. CT surgery has come a long way since then. I don<APO>t know if I could talk a surgeon nowadays into what I did back then or not. We did a lot of things in the old days that are no longer done the same way. Sometimes to prevent infections, or other complications, sometimes to save money. I would not recommend you ask any doctor to do anything in a way that he was not trained to do it. You are close to the Canadian border, if you feel strongly about this, go to Canada and have it done there. Take care, Annette""I realize that you are one of the unfortunate people with PTPS, however, after reading at all the sites you provided, the majority of them said that 65-67% of thoracotomy patients might develop this problem, not the 80% that you mention. They also said that all but about 5% were able to be treated with fair-good relief. Only a very small % of patients had severe pain after a thoracotomy that was actually disabling. That is no comfort if you are one of those people. It seemed that epidural or intrathecal opiates were often used for treatment early on after surgery in the post op period. I did not read about oral opiates in these studies, either for early use or later in treatment. I have found the NIH studies to be more reliable that others, you have to read how many people were studied, who paid for the study, and what kind of study it was, to rate them as poor, fair, good. Double blind randomized studies are the gold standard, but not always available, a large number of participants is better than the small studies. Who paid for the study or set it up is always interesting. I hope you feel better soon and find a doctor that you work well with, if you haven<APO>t already. Take care, Annette""I understand that you feel bitter. That said, read the rest of that paragraph. It describes pain as any discomfort at all, and is only talking about two months post op. I have never met anyone who had their chest cracked open that did not feel some discomfort for at least TWO months!! I am not doubting that this pain syndrome exists, but you must read all the studies very carefully. Often they are done on a very small number of patients, or have strange conditions and definitions. That can radically change how they turn out. I believe that you hurt, so don<APO>t yell at me. Take care, Annette""Ask your doctor where you can be tested to find out if you are one of these rare people. You may be able to learn more about it on line, but you certainly can<APO>t find out if you are one of those people on line. I think they do blood tests repeatedly after you take a test dose of opiate. They measure for the amount of drug in your blood several times at regular intervals. This should show if your organs metabolize opiates and remove them from your blood more quickly than other people. Rather than look on a commercial site or a social networking site for info, I would suggest you look on a non-commercial medical site. Try searching on Medscape for an article that was published in a peer reviewed medical journal. See what you find, but if your doctor sees this as a potential problem for you, he should be leading you in the right direction. Best of luck, Annette""Hi, Beth This might or might not have helped you with your meds because our bodies break down carbs quickly, and protein much more slowly. They tell diabetics to always eat a protein along with a carb if they have a low glucose episode for this reason. As you know, this way their blood sugar comes up quickly, then stays up for awhile. Crakers and peanut butter or crackers and cheese. It sounds like this nutritional ""trick"" may carry the drug along with the protein. I don<APO>t know. My understanding of rapid metabolizing of opiates is that it happens on a different physiological plane than in the stomach/gut. My understanding is that the metabolization occurs in the liver/kidneys as they clean the drug from the blood. I guess it is time for me to go read more on this subject. Take care, Annette""Thanks for your suggestion. It is an easy way for all of us to give our meds a bit more of a kick. Changing ones diet a bit does not cost anything and we can all give it a try. What kind of amino acid complex do you take? I will start tomorrow by increasing the protein in my diet. Take care, Annette""When did your pain start? I assume you mean Fosamax generic? My reference book indicates about 6% of users have musculoskeletal pain and 1-7% have stomach pain. Did your doctor decide that the med was causing your pain? Have you had tests to rule out any other cause of the pain? Ususally pharmacists have the most up to date information on drug side effects and whether or not they will go away if you stop using the drugs, I would suggest you discuss this with your pharmacist and see what he says. Take care, Annette""Yes, I do still read via email digests, though they still have not been fixed, grrr! That aside, what are the new things? Hope you are feeling okay. Hugs, Annette""In the very old days, the board worked that way, I am so glad it is going back to that process. I think all new responses should be available at the top of the board, that way they don<APO>t get buried. That was one of the reasons I switched to the email digests. You are correct the digests come once per day, but not at the times one signs up for, I have gotten used to that also, lol. Thanks for the update. Hugs, Annette""It was only gone for 3-4 days, but if the board is moving quickly, that is enough to miss posts. I am doing okay, I have only been reading and posting about every other day lately. I have noticed how tough things have ben going for you, I hope you get to feeling better soon. Take care, Annette""My computer had to go to the shop for some minor repairs. But it is home now, and I am back. I missed you all. Take care, Annette""Keep in close contact with your doctors, both the ones treating your CRPS and the ones treating your diabetes. Has your diabetes always been under good control before? Steroids are pretty famous for screwing up your blood sugar, keep close attention to your sugar levels and write them down for your diabetes doctor to see. There are a few people here who have RSD/CRPS and if you keep an eye on this post I am sure they will respond. I don<APO>t have it, but I have other chronic pain conditions, and visit here regularly. Take care, Annette""Forget going to her for help, I would check with your union steward. Your husband may have to consider getting a regular job working for someone else and getting insurance that way. It sucks, but what else can you guys do? Do not keep meds in your pocketbook, unless you can keep it with you at all times or lock it up securely at work. She should just not have access to them. Neither should anyone else of course. You can always lock them in the trunk of your car if necessary. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t think insurance companies are a necessary evil. I am for a single payer health care system.The sooner we get rid of all the competing insurance companies the better of we will all be and the lower our health costs will be. My husband is retired now, but his old company had a large deductible, $2,000, but they kept a company fund that paid half of that for employees who met their deductible. That really helped, but my husband<APO>s hip replacement still cost us $5,000 out of our own pocket. It took us a couple of years to pay that off. All we had was health coverage, we had long ago lost the dental and vision because it cost too much. It is crazy. He kept working as long as he did because we needed his health insurance. As soon as he became eligible for Medicare and SS retirement, he retired and I am quite happy with Medicare for now. Take care, Annette PS, Rant anytime you like.""I totally understand what you are saying, Two of my three brothers are self employed and have always had their own businesses. Now my older brother is 62, his wife is 60 and they are looking at working until they die because they put their extra $$ into their daughter<APO>s college education instead of their own retirement. I hate to think what would happen to them if they became ill or were injured and could no longer work. I hope their daughter finishes medical school and plans on supporting them when they are old, lol. All you can do is figure things out and see what your best deal is. Don<APO>t blame yourself for anything, it isn<APO>t your fault, just pick up that phone and call your union rep. Maybe she will be able to come up with something you haven<APO>t thought of. Take care, Annette""No one, not even the best doctor can predict how you will react to a medicine that you have not even tried yet. He may have an opinion, but he doesn<APO>t know for sure. I tried so many different combinations that didn<APO>t work, and then finally found a combo that works for me. Some side effects also go away after a few weeks or months even. If you don<APO>t try, you will never know. Good luck to you whatever you decide to do. Take care, Annette""Usually the itching goes away after a few weeks. It is a common side effect of opiates. The pain pill is not supposed to help your depression, just your pain. If you find it makes your depression worse, tell the doctor and perhaps he can suggest changing the dose or schedule, of stopping it altogether. You may benefit from an antidepressant, it may help both your depression, and your pain. Discuss this with your doctor. You might ask your therapist about cognitive behavioral therapy, I found it very useful. I would try and not worry about what may happen later in the day, just deal with how you feel right now. Take care, Annette""True, it might make your depression worse, but it may also make it better. Opiates were used to treat depression for a select few people in the old days. You don<APO>t know until you try it. I have been involved in nursing for 40 years now, there have been many changes in therapy of many kinds for different mental health issues. I am a firm believer in cognitive behavioral therapy for learning to live with chronic pain and the depression and mood disorders that often accompany it. Nothing works the same for everyone. It seems you have a reason for not trying everything anyone mentions, since you are so far ahead of the rest of us, I guess I should not make suggestions at all. I am sorry if I offended you somehow. Take care, Annette""I would give it a try before you move out of your home state, unless of course, you have other reasons to move. I currently live in Oregon, I have lived and worked as a nurse in Calif. and Nevada. Marijuana is used medically here also. I tried it many years ago both by smoking and ingestion for pain. It did not help me to deal with my pain at all, it just got me high. I was not looking for that at all, so I let it go and went back to prescribed medications. We are all different in our responses to medicines of all kinds. I have never had any difficulty in getting opiates from doctors as I feel I am honest and forthright with them just like I am about other medications. There may be doctors out there who are too scared to prescribe opiates to nurses, I just have not come across them myself. I hope you find the relief you are looking for. Take care, Annette""Hi, Dave I have only lived in three states, Calif., Nevada, and Oregon. Out of those, only Calif. had a short term disability program that covered workers who became ill or needed surgery. Also the health plans that states have for folks who doin<APO>t have insurance or have pre-existing conditions are very expensive. My friend looked into it for her husband up here in Oregon and it was over $400 per month at that time. Part of the new insurance plan that Obama passed says someone has to be off insurance for six months to qualify to get insurance through it. At least that is what I read. Even Medicare for the disabled requires you to be disabled and on SSDI for two years before you are covered. I think they want us to die off due to a lack of medical care. I agree with you that the Human Resources Office or the Union Steward are the best places to look for help. It is hard and confusing for anyone newly disabled. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know enough to tell you if you need to see a PM doctor or not. If you and your doctor think that is the best way to go, I would give it a try. But, do go see a PM doctor who uses many different forms of pain control, not just injections and procedures. Are you doing everything your surgeon has told you to do as far as keeping the foot elevated higher than your heart most of the time, etc.? Take care, Annette""My husband was on methadone and oxycodone for a couple of years for chronic pain, but when he had his hip replaced and the pain went down he was able to taper off the methadone with minimal to no withdrawal symptoms. He told me he didn<APO>t have any, and I certainly didn<APO>t see any. The oxycodone is something he rarely uses anymore. I would hold steady with your current plan and the symptoms will go away. it is something you have to deal with, but you are doing that already. I doubt it will get much worse, and should get gradually better. The twitching legs and irritability are common signs of opioid withdrawal. Itching and sleeping all the time are really not standard symptoms. Usually people have great difficulty sleeping. When did you take off the last patch? I am a bit confused, I wasn<APO>t sure if you put the last one on on Thursday, or took it off on Thursday? Everyone is different in how they feel withdrawal, but trust me not everyone goes through horrible symptoms for weeks on end. I took care of heroin addicts back in the 1970s when I worked in a methadone program for several years and although one may not feel ""normal"" after a week, one can work through it just fine. I assume you are working with your doctor, let him know how you feel and see if he can suggest other meds or treatments for your current symptoms. How is your chronic pain doing? You didn<APO>t mention it at all. Are you doing something else to control it, or is it just taking a backseat to your withdrawal symptoms for now? Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Is she seeing a dermatologist? Perhaps they would know best how to handle this? Take care, Annette""Thank you all for all the support and good wishes. I got home yesterday morning. I had a lot of pain that night in the hospital, but today I am feeling much better, I even skipped an entire cycle of break though pain meds this am. I went from 12:30 am to 9:30 am with out taking the BT meds. The PM doc said I may take them every four hours as needed, and he said to keep ahead of the pain. I know the pain levels will go up and down throughout my recovery, I am prepared, and so are my doctors. I still have a drain in each side, they will come out when I see my surgeon on Tuesday. Another step forward. Again, thank you all for all your support. Will write as I am able. Hugs, Annette""Hi, Caprice Thanks for your kind attention. Yes, the drains are out, and all I have left are the incisions, but I will not need to have any sutures removed. They are inside with Dermabond gluing the edges together. All is well, I expect recovery to be a bit of up and down, but so far, so good. Hugs, Annette""Thanks, Caprice. There have been huge improvements over the last 15-20 years. I am lucky to take advantage of them now. You are the best. Hugs, Annette""My surgery is at 10 in the am. I should be home again by Thursday at noon. Everything sounds like it is going along smoothly. Keep your fingers all crossed and I will drop a short line as soon as I can. It is nice to have the support of all my family and my friends here at WebMD too. I hope everyone is having days with minimal pain and stiffness. Bless you all. Talk to you soon. Hugs, Annette""I am on Part D Medicare for my meds also. I have not had any trouble getting the meds I need for pain. I currently use methadone, but I know they cover generic MS Contin. My doctor writes for oxycodone for break though pain and they give me 5 mg. tablets, I currently take 3-4 at one time. They cover that medicine always. Nucynta is a relatively new pain med, I have not used it for that reason. I don<APO>t know if it would be covered or not. But there are similar meds that are covered. Get the formulary from your insurance company and go over it with your doctor.There must be meds that you can try. Take care, Annette""I am sorry, I just do not know enough about this kind of thing to be helpful. I will think good thoughts for you, and hope all goes well whatever you decide to do. Take care, Annette""If it does not go away in a few weeks, I would again bring it to your doctor<APO>s attention. It sounds like referred pain, but since you already told the doctor, I would wait ahile and see what happens. Take care, Annette""There are urgent care places he can go to to get xrays, and treatment, there are also free or low cost clinics in many cities. They can<APO>t afford to advertise, so try searching for them on the computer or by calling Goodwill, Salvation Army, Catholic Charities, etc. Take care, Annette""I agree with Swank. I would interview different doctors and ask them specific questions about who and why they do what they do with meds. You will find the right doctor for you if you listen closely. I just had major surgery on Wednesday. My PM consult doc said to change my BT meds from ""10-20 mg. every four to six hours with a max. of five 10 mg. pills a day"", to 15 mg. every four hours pretty much around the clock. Otherwise to leave my meds alone. So my long acting methadone stayed the same. Other than the first day after surgery, this plan has worked well. That day I took an extra 5 mg. twice as my surgeon ordered. Now I am taking far less than that. I find a pain score of 5 to be workable for me, my surgical floor nurse wanted me to be down to a 3. I laughed and said I hadn<APO>t seen a 3 for 15 years, lol. Everyone has a different pain score number where they can function, I feel that is what you should aim for. I would never, ever suggest taking more than your doctor has prescribed, if it hurts too on your maximum meds, call him and wake him up in the middle of the night and ask him what to do, unless you and he have an emergency plan to deal with extra pain. Good luck to you, Annette""I just read the poll clearly, I am sorry but if ""pain runs my life"" the pain is NOT adequately managed. I hope things are better for you than that. Take care, Annette""You should be seen by a doctor anytime you have sudden headache pain that is new or different for you. This sounds like it qualifies and I would suggest you go see a doctor. If this is ""the worst headache of your life"" use those words to describe it. Take care, Annette""If you don<APO>t think you are safe to drive, then don<APO>t drive. That is your responsibility. If you kill someone because you have pain while you are driving, that will be on you and you have to be certain you are ready to live with that. That is a tough decision to make. That aside, often times doctors do not come up with a definite dx. for intermittent chest pain. Make sure it is nothing that is cardiac related, then figure out what to do to prevent or treat it if it happens. Have they ruled out costochondritis? Take care, Annette""Hi, Bren There is a whole group of folk who believe this is a real part of FMS, and treat adrenal fatigue very seriously. However, I have been on these kinds of boards for FMS and pain for many years, and no one has ever posted that they were cured after a year or so, once the honeymoon effect has worn off. I read about it, did not find serious evidence based studies to support it, and decided to leave it alone for now. When and if they do more real double blind studies and they stop selling lab tests ""that are not available anywhere else"", I would be happy to read more about it. It has been 3-4 years since I did any serious research on this subject. Perhaps things have improved, perhaps not. I just don<APO>t know. Take care, Annette""The only thing I have ever heard of that worked was to keep a diary of everything you put in your mouth, and add to that diary, the painful episodes. Then after a month or so go over it with your doctor and see if there are any specific triggers for you. Alcohol and cigarettes are common, but some people have other food triggers. Eliminating them can help, but not cure your problem. I do sympathize, chronic pancreatitis is a painful condition. Take care, Annette""My husband had AVN of his left hip, and he had a total hip replacement a couple of years ago. The surgery was on a Tues. morning and he came home on Friday morning. He felt 100% better as soon as he woke up from surgery. He was back to work in 8 weeks, no real restrictions, as a heavy truck mechanic. He had to wait a long while to have his hip replaced due to some other medical issues. He now wishes he had been able to do it sooner. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""I am confused, first you said you are doing okay, just some stiffness and soreness daily, then you asked for suggestions for the pain you are having? What kind of pain do you have, when does it seem to come on and when does it seem to lessen? What can you do with minimal pain and what things is the pain keeping you from doing at all? Are you on any medicines at all? Take care, Annette""Well said!!!! I can<APO>t remember not having pain, it is just a part of life for me. My doctor and I manage to keep the levels down to about a 5, I can function okay at that level. Take care, Annette""Me too, lol. Swank is great. I suggest doing a bit of volunteer work, even calling shut ins from your home to check on them once a day, does good for them, and helps you feel productive. Call around your neighborhood and see what is available. Take care, Annette""Dave<APO>s reply was great. I agree with him. Unfortunately, your dear wife will start out having more bad days than good ones, then she should gradually even out and then have more good days than bad ones. It takes a long time to recover from a blood clot or vascular problem. The body must slowly grow new blood vessels that take over for the damaged one. It is great that her surgeon did not just go ahead and do the surgery but instead told you and your wife what he had discovered and gave her options besides surgery. I would get a second vascular surgery consultation. If two doctors agree that surgery can wait, then take her to a pain management doctor that does all kinds of treatments, not just interventions. It may well be that she can tolerate different pain management options, and it will take some time to figure that out. I have had a blood clot in my leg, and besides the anticoagulants, they also told me to walk, walk, walk. It helps the leg become strong and grow more blood vessels to nourish the muscles. Mine was very minor after a spinal surgery, but it still took 6-12 months to resolve. Take care, Annette""There are all kinds of meds for pain until/if she decides to have surgery later on. A pain management doctor who manages all kinds of pain with injections, procedures, and oral meds is the one to see. Take care, Annette""Chest contusions hurt for a long time, because it is impossible to immobilize the chest. You have to breathe, and that movement causes irritation and makes healing slower. I would discuss this with your doctor, MD, not chiro, and ask him if your injury justifies the amount of pain you are having or if further examination might be needed. It is possible to have small rib fractures that are not seen on the initial xrays, they hurt for a long time while they are healing. Take care, Annette""I hope you feel better soon. Take care, Annette""Yes. Any new or different kind of pain should be reported to your doctor. Take care, Annette""I use the same pharmacy all the time. I was on long acting morphine for about 10 years without any problems. I switched to methadone a bit over a year ago at my request so I could avoid getting into the donut hole with Medicare Part D. It works fine for me. I have never had to wait until the last possible day to refill my RX though, that would stress me out big time. Take care, Annette""Going through opioid withdrawal is no fun, you can be very sick, but unless you have some underlying health issue, you will not die from withdrawals by going cold turkey. I would contact your pcp and show him/her the letter the PM doctor sent you. See if he can at least help you withdraw from the methadone without severe sypmtoms, if not prescribe it for you. My pcp prescribes my methadone for me. I have seen a pain management specialist twice in the last ten years or so, just for a consultation. Once was before I had surgery to recommend pain management afterwards. Take care, Annette""I do know if you are late paying your bills, the office may cut you off. If you don<APO>t have a doctor to treat you anymore, I would use those meds to withdraw from the opiates slowly rather than suddenly, but that is just my choice. Will your pcp see you and suggest anything? Or is this guy your pcp? Take care, Annette""I agree with Dave, just call the office and ask them for another appt. There are many reasons why an appt. might have been cancelled. Doctors often require dental work or surgery themselves, or they may need to take a required continuing education class or something else like that. If the office has dropped you as a patient, they will tell you, and they usually send you a registered letter explaining why. Take care, Annette""I think that doctors call them ""growing pains"" when they don<APO>t have any other diagnosis. Often the kids out grow them, sometimes the doctors do find other diagnoses. All four of my siblings and I had them, my son and my nephew both had them, we all grew out of them without ever being diagnosed with anything else. They just gradually went away. My nephew was the most seriously affected, he would wake up screaming, like you describe. If there is nothing to do to prevent Osgood-Schlatter, if your grandchild does show signs, then I would rub her legs, give her a warm bath and whatever else your family usually does. I am unaware of any treatments to do to prevent any problems from occurring. Take care, Annette""We all had ""growing pains"" much younger than middle and high school. My brothers had them in elementary school, my nephew even younger. I am with your grand-daughter<APO>s mother, I never took my son to the doctor for every ache and pain. I think waiting for another episode is reasonable, unless the child has been in misery for a long time already. Besides she is the mother, and it is up to her. It is kind of nice being the grandmother now, I have all the fun, but the major decisions are up to their parents. I trust them to do the right thing. Take care, Annette""I have taken ambien pretty much daily for about 15 years now. Once I went off the ambien and tried other sleep aids, but they didn<APO>t work, so my doctor put me back on ambien at a slightly higher dose. I prefer it to other sleep aids because it has a very short half life, about 2.5 hours, so I don<APO>t get the hangover that I got from other meds similar to muscle relaxants. My primary symptom from FMS now is pain, but fatigue runs a close second for me. I really have not found anything that helps much. I am disabled and no longer working, so I just try and factor naps into my daily routine when I can. I have DDD of my cervical spine, FMS, and migraines. I just had surgery on the 19th, but I feel like I am recovering well. I simply do not sleep much without the ambien, my pain levels then go up through the roof. Life is no good without sleep, lol. 5-6 hours with ambien is better than 1-2 hours without it. Take care, Annette""The half life of a drug is the amount of time it takes your body to clear one half of the medicine you took. At least that is my understanding of the term. Say you take 10 mg. of ambien, 2.5 hours later you should only have 5 mg. left in your system, 2.5 hours after that, you will have 2.5 mg still in your system. In my experience the drugs with a shorter half life get out of my system sooner and do not leave me with a hangover, like the drugs with a longer half life do. Take care, Annette""I believe that FMS IS a neurological process, and I think it will gradually shift over to neurologists to care for us. In many communities they have already started. I swear by neurontin, ambien, and opiates to manage my pain, but I also believe that one needs to exercise, and do other pain management techniques also. I had surgery recently and started ibuprofen afterwards. I have found I was able to reduce my pain meds, and my pcp believes the ibuprofen is at least partly replacing them. She told me to stay on it for now. Everyone is different and requires different pain management techniques. Opiates are last on the list, but appropriate for a small subset of FMS folk according to the most recent studies I am aware of. You might try reading at http://www.mylagia.com for good medical info about FMS. Print out what seems to hit home with you and take it to your pcp. My pcp is an internal medicine doctor and she manages my FMS for me. I don<APO>t see a specialist at all. Take care, Annette""They offer you sleeping aids because the number one reason people are fatigued is that they are not sleeping right. If that is not your problem, speak up and tell them. I personally remember back in the days when doctors wrote lots of RXs for amphetamines and valium, to help people stay up and also sleep well. Thank God I was not one of those people. However, to this day, I will not take valium (or other benzos) or any kind of stimulant designed to help one stay awake and bright eyed. I have never met ANYONE who can function with chronic pain like they did before they had chronic pain. I accept the limitations my body has now and work around them to do most of the things that I want to do, but not everything. If you can find a way, best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Hi, Bren Always good to see your posts. I took valium three nights in a row back in my twenties for insomnia, I got the best ""high"" for 20-30 minutes, then fell fast asleep. I did have terrible nightmares from them though, so I tossed them in the trash. If I was going to be a drug addict my drug of choice would be valium. I have never taken it since then. I personally think that one should not mix benzos and opioids at all. I went to a pain management class for health care professionals a couple of years ago and the woman teaching the college level class said that the most recent studies showed this combination to be very dangerous, and she felt once the study results were widely available, doctors would gradually stop this kind of practice. I have felt the same way since I worked in a methadone clinic in the 1970s. Clients who were taking methadone and got RXs for valium (or took it illegally) got in serious trouble with sedation and respiratory depression. We finally said no more valium to our clients, it would be treated as a dirty urine as far as random urine screens even with a RX. If the zanaflex works for you, and it sounds like it does, stick with that. Since your muscle spasms happen late in the evening, do you really need anything for the daytime? Though the valium may require higher doses as you become tolerant to its muscle relaxing effects, it is my understanding that you do not develop the same tolerance to the sedating effects. I believe there IS a top dose of valium, unlike opiates. I use daily opioids and have for well over fifteen years now. I take them for FMS pain. I won<APO>t argue the whole musculoskeletal vs. neurological pain thing, I will leave that to those more highly educated in that area than I am. I have found however, that when I have had radiculopathy as diagnosed by my doctor in my right hand/arm/shoulder from DDD in my cervical spine, the opioids I use do not generally help much. NSAIDs work better for that for me. I had breast reduction surgery recently and was able to reduce my long acting opioid by HALF afterwards. I started taking ibuprofen 400 mg. three times a day on the recommendation of a pain management doc two weeks after the surgery. I am not positive why I was able to so drastically reduce my pain meds, I don<APO>t know if I have less pain in my upper back and neck due to the surgery or the addition of ibuprofen or both. Either way I am a happy old lady. By the by, I had no withdrawals at all. It sounds like your doctor has things well under control. Let him know if the zanaflex stops working for you, or if you have any other problems. Hugs, Annette""Thank you for your military service. My favorite FMS site for solid information is http://www.myalgia.com That is really all I have to say, wish I could help you more. Take care, Annette""I would call and make an appt. with the radiologist who signed off on the latest MRI. Sit down with him and ask him if your spine truly improved, or if it was just read a bit differently than last time. Let him explain the difference to you. If you continue to be in doubt, ask if a neuro-radiologist can look at them and explain them to you. Take care, Annette""Obviously, don<APO>t drive when you feel any effects from your meds other than pain relief, but especially light headedness. this will probably pass within a short time. Let your doctor know about this when you see him. The itching is a normal side effect of opiates and as long as you have no rash or difficulty breathing, you should be okay. Discuss this with your doctor when you see him, but be sure to tell him immediately if a rash is present. That could be an allergic reaction that he needs to know about. Just itching, without a rash, usually goes away on its own after a few weeks. It did for me. Take care, Annette""I would call your insurance company and ask why they are not covering these injections anymore. I am not sure it is the best treatment for your condition, but I don<APO>t know about that. I am not a doctor. It may be that the insurance company did not feel the cost was worth improved pain ""for days"". What else did you do for pain management during the five months between injections? See what the insurance company says, and compare that with what the doctor said. Perhaps you will come to some conclusions. Take care, Annette""I would call your insurance company and ask them what they will cover, and how to appeal any decision they make that is not agreeable to you. My doctor simply wrote a letter to the insurance company once and they approved the medicine I wanted. I agree with your mom, you never know unless you ask. It sounds like you know what to do for your pain, but sometimes just knowing there is one more thing available that will give you relief for a few days helps you get through the bad days. Take care, Annette""Welcome to our community. I look forward to seeing your posts on this forum. Take care, Annette""I am not aware of any long term side effects of opiate medicines other than the constipation that seems to come with them for most people. The tylenol in vicodin may be problematic for your liver if taken in too high a dose for too long a time. My doctor does regular liver function tests for me, as I use this drug also. Take care, Annette""I personally opt not to try any new med or new delivery system until it has been in wide use for five years. I feel the FDA approves these things without proper studies. I use old, generic drugs that have been in use for decades. We know their side effects, and what to expect when using them. I have not seen any good medical studies that show any one opiate is more effective or has less side effects than any other. If he has one for this drug, please post a link to it so we can all see it for ourselves. Percocet and roxicodone both contain oxycodone in a short acting form. Oxycodone is available in a long acting form if you wanted to try that, of you could try other generic long acting opiates that are far cheaper than the Butrans Patch. I personally would just opt to try all the old, cheap drugs before trying a fairly new brand name drug. But, at least it is long acting. You shouldn<APO>t have the ups and downs that you would have with short acting pills. I recommend you educate yourself, by reading all you can from real medical sites (not ones that are trying to sell you something) about your specific condition, and all the treatment options you have. It seems you are on the very beginning of taking opiates for pain, but you did not mention what else you are doing? Are you taking other kinds of medications, exercising, using PT, OT, cognitive behavioral therapy, etc.? Pain management is a combination of many different kinds of treatments, not just opiates. Take care, Annette""I also use methadone for chronic pain, I asked for it because I wanted something cheaper so I would not have to deal with the donut hole in Medicare Part D. I am a retired nurse, still an RN, and I worked in a methadone clinic for addicts back in the 70s. Believe me we know more now about how to use methadone properly than we did then. The one side effect I am aware of other than the usual opioid side effects is a cardiac rhythm disturbance that seems to be from methadone only. I saw a pain management doctor recently and asked him if I should be checking my EKG occasionally, and he said to get a base line one soon, and then get one once a year. However, he did say that he thought this effect was dose related at higher doses. He did not say exactly what was a higher dose though. I was taking 10 mg. three times a day, but have since been able to cut that in half. I had no withdrawals either. My EKG was normal as expected, and I will have one once a year for as long as I am on methadone at all. I am very lucky that my state, Oregon, has an excellent system for using opioids for chronic non-malignant pain. The medical board is supportive and lets doctors know just what they need to do to best serve us and not make themselves open for investigation by the drug police. I was a volunteer for a study group, the rest of the members were MDs and pharmacists, for our medicaid program and we did not find any evidence based studies that showed any one opiate worked better or had fewer side effects than another. Since they all work about the same, I opt for methadone. It is dirt cheap and long lasting. I absolutely refuse to try any meds that have not been widely prescribed for at least five years. My doctor knows that, and does not even bring them up anymore. Everything I am currently using is generic. My doctor here in Oregon has let me pretty much decide what drugs I want to try, we discuss the pros and cons, and then if the MD feels comfortable with it, she writes the RX. My doctor has never turned me down for a reasonable choice. I am only slightly more educated than the average non-medical layperson, but I do try and find out what my options are before I talk to the doctor, and have real evidence based studies that I can quote or give her links to. Take care, Annette""I would talk to your doctor before using anymore Butrans patches. Using left over drugs is rarely a good idea, unless you speak to your doctor first. Take care, Annette""Good luck to you. Take care, Annette""What does your doctor say about all these problems you are having?? Is he aware that you went off of the Butran for a week? How low was your potassium in the ER? What was the lab value prior to the IV potassium? Take care, Annette""Discuss this with your doctor. You may have an allergy to the adhesive that holds the patch in place. Be prepared to show the doctor the rash at the site, bring a patch to the office if there is any chance he will remove the patch to look under it. Also show him the area where you would like to put the patch on your upper arms or legs, see what he says, or ask your pharmacist. Take care, Annette""I have been on gabapentin for about 12 years or so. I find that I notice how much it helps when I try not taking it for awhile. It isn<APO>t like taking a pill and the pain goes away. The Lortab is a short acting med, so unless you take it every 4-6 hours around the clock it won<APO>t work for 24/7 pain. I would not use Butran patches personally, because that particular patch is fairly new and very expensive. I will stick with plain, old methadone. A rather low dose does it for me at this point in my life. I would personally discuss my meds with the doctor who writes the RXs, not with an asst. When I first went on a generic of MS Contin, I only took it at bedtime, so I could get the pain relief necessary to sleep. Sleep is SO important in maintaining the strength and resolve to deal with chronic pain. Take care, Annette""All of the opioids for long acting use are schedule II narcotics. They are approved for use for chronic pain, even non-malignant chronic pain. I understand wanting to save them for last choice rather than prescribing them immediately. I have nothing against assts. usually they are PAs or advanced practice nurses, but for starting a new med, I would prefer to speak to the doctor himself. I may be used to my pcp, I always see her rather than an asst. It just feels right to me. As far as allowing your wife to hear about your medical problems, I believe now you need to sign a written release giving them permission if you haven<APO>t already done so. I had to do this for my doctor<APO>s office to talk to my hubby on the phone. It is just for our privacy. Best of luck at your next appt. Take care, Annette""Best of luck to you. Let us know how it goes next week when you have the appt. Take care, Annette""I have not personally used the Butran patch, so I can<APO>t tell you what to expect. I do know that every drug is dose related, so if this dose does not help you enough and you wish to keep trying, they can increase the dose of the patch. Do you have break through meds to use if you need them? Do not mix anything with the patch unless your doctor has specifically told you it is okay. Perhaps the good Dr. A. here can tell you more about this drug. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""I agree, please check with your doctor or at least with a knowledgable pharmacist first, then take whatever is suggested by your doctor. Take care, Annette""I really do not believe in ""pushing through the pain"" rather than taking BT meds, but that varies from person to person, doctor to doctor. And medication to medication. A bit of nausea doesn<APO>t sound too terrible. Nausea is one of those side effects that usually goes away with a little time. Getting 6 hours of sleep in a row sounds great too!!! Keep a written journal and talk to your doctor when you see him again. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Dosage adjustments are common no matter what medicine you are on. I hope it all works out for you, if it does not last the full 7 days, let your doctor know as soon as the pain returns, maybe the increase in dosage will make it last longer, I don<APO>t know. Take care, Annette""Best of luck to you, I hope the patch continues to work well for your particular needs and that the increase in dose gives you better relief with tolerable side effects. Let us know how things go for you. Take care, Annette""Sounds great to me. Have you tried things like hot showers before and after PT to warm and loosen muscles? Or discussed with your doctor trying over-the-counter meds or other BT meds for these times? The nausea should go away with time, ask your doctor about this and any new or different headaches. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t take any of the antidepressants, they made things worse for me. I don<APO>t believe one is much different from the others in each class SSRIs, SNRIs, etc.. I think Effexor was one of the last ones I actually tried. But, of course we are all different, what works for one person may not work for another, and vice versa. My husband used Cymbalta with fairly good results. By carefully warming up the muscles, they should not become inflamed and irritate the nerves after a workout. It is hard to explain, I know what you mean by being sore but not like the muscles are hurting. I would give the Butrans patch you are using at least a couple of months to see if the side effects fade away. Many of them often do. That is just me, it would depend on the severity of the side effects. Take care, Annette""Thanks, Dr. Maine. You gave us the basic info about this drug. Take care, Annette""Yes, of course you should talk to your doctor. I would not take any more Lortab without getting an okay from him first. Anytime you start a new pain medicine, the dose may need to be adjusted until you get the right balance of relief and side effects. Hopefully, more relief and few side effects. If the doctor does not hear from you, he will think everything is okay and the dose is working, when it clearly is not. Talk to him about all your questions. Take care, Annette""My husband<APO>s standard treatment of anyone who asks inappropriate questions is to look them dead in the eye, and say ""Why would you ask that?"" Give them a minute to jabber, then walk away. It does work for him. I don<APO>t tell most folk what I am on or what I have taken recently, I don<APO>t even tell them I have pain, seldom does anyone ask questions about my meds. I am in my 60s maybe that is why no one asks. Everyone has their own way of dealing with these kinds of questions. Take care, Annette""Forget about us, it makes our wounded warriors look like a bunch of drug addicts. Mr. Zoroya needs to distinguish between legally prescribed and used medications and illegal drugs or legal drugs that are used improperly. I doubt that the general mentioned in one article had a doctor that prescribed five dozen Oxycontin to be taken in a 24 hour period. I am familiar with Gregg Zoroya<APO>s previous articles. I belonged to a group of family members of military personnel, and corresponded with him briefly shortly after the wars started. He is a good guy, he just needs more education so he knows the difference between addiction and dependency. I think this discussion is one that needs to happen, but we need to carefully use words as they are medically defined when discussing medical issues. I believe that this kind of article does more harm than good. I sent a letter to the publication involved. Take care, Annette""I am a real believer in cognitive behavioral therapy for depression, anxiety, and pain control. When I was forced to stop working as a nurse due to my health problems I became severely depressed, and suicidal. I saw a therapist for awhile and when I moved away, she recommended ""Feeling Good"", by Dr. David Burns, MD. It is a great book, that you can use on your own or with a therapist. I really believe that by using the techniques in the book I was able to cure the depression and it has never returned. It is a good read anyhow, very interesting. This book can be used with or without antidepressants, with or without a therapist. I used it on my own. Antidepressants did not help me, they made things worse due to side effects. Not everyone will have that reaction, they help many people. Best of luck to you. I hope you will continue to visit here. Take care, Annette""War(s), emphasis on the ""s"". We are currently fighting two wars. Take care, Annette""Hi, Dr. Abaci My problem is that the author used some words incorrectly, and that makes me question the rest of the article. I used to work in a heroin addiction treatment center back in the 1970s, and the one thing I learned is that we all ""have access to illegal drugs"". In whose opinion are these warriors ""over medicated"", and ""abuse prescriptions"". What do those statements really mean? How many of the folks who post here have taken a left over pain pill that was prescribed for say, dental pain, because their usual chronic back pain was severe and they had nothing else? That is ""abuse of prescription drugs"". As is taking a spouse<APO>s left over pain medicine. My son is a former Marine, he served eight years active duty, and went to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq for deployments three times. He is considered 90% disabled, due to many combat related injuries, but he works and has had steady employment since leaving the Marines. Two employers so far in five years. He works full time to support his family, his wife works full time and goes to school part time in a Master<APO>s program at USC. They have two children. The VA has a long way to go to provide decent medical care to our vets, and the military has a long way to go to stop their own way of thinking about mental illnesses like PTSD. Saying you have PTSD is a career-ender in the Marines, admitting any emotional or mental weakness is wrong according to them. It was a long time before my son admitted to himself and to others that PTSD played a part in his problems. Certainly, not until after he left active duty and was certain he would never return to the military. My son gets relatively good VA care where he is in southern Calif. but he prefers to use the health insurance his wife gets from her employer because it is so much easier and faster to access health care. He says he would have to wait in the ER for five or six hours at the VA hospital, but can get in within an hour or two at the local community hospital. This VA health care prevents him from moving to certain areas where there is no care available. As a nurse, I have found that the geographical area where the VA hospital is located has a lot to do with it. The VA hospitals in some cities I have worked in had great reputations, others had terrible ones. Our vets deserve better than that. Currently, there is only one VA hospital in the entire state of Oregon, in Portland, how is that right? The last I heard there was one VA clinic outside of Portland, in Roseberg. But, nothing in eastern Oregon. As far as long term plans for chronic pain for vets, I doubt it is any better than it is for the rest of us with chronic pain. Right now, there is little evidence-based treatment for chronic pain. Many of us have tried what is available on and off label and still find ourselves in pain. If opiates help, fine, but we all have to watch out for ill effects, just like with other treatments. I agree that we all need more than just RXs, but some of us have used them properly and do as well as one has a right to expect. I expect the researchers to come up with new and innovative treatments for chronic pain. I bet that will be one good thing that these wars bring. Every war brings innovations in medical care, better trauma care, better prosthetics, etc. It is so sad that wars do so little good generally, but they do improve our medical care. That<APO>s it for my rant of the day, lol. Take care, Annette""I agree, communicating on line can be difficult, not having facial expressions really can change the way a post comes across. Oh well, at least we generate some good discussions. Take care, Annette""The difference is huge. Addiction is the compulsive use of a substance for other than what it was prescribed for, and in spite of its negative consequences in ones life. For instance taking a legal RX for pain meds that were prescribed for physical pain and using them to get high or to deal with emotional issues, or using illegal drugs to get high could both lead to addiction. One might get arrested for stealing, or drug possession, or for driving under the influence, or ones family and friends might be suffering due to the person getting high, one might lose their job due to their drug problems. These are all complications of addiction. In the latest medical studies, less than one percent of those people who use prescribed opiates for pain will become addicted to them. Dependence is when the use of a drug causes the body to become used to it and if the drug is stopped suddenly or decreased severely the body goes through a withdrawal syndrome of various physical symptoms. This can happen with a variety of drugs, not just pain medicines. But, this happens to everyone who uses opiates on a daily basis over time. Withdrawal can be avoided for the most part if the doctor slowly tapers the person of off the opiate rather than just stopping it suddenly. Tolerance is another word commonly used with regard to opiates. Tolerance means the body gets used to a certain level of the drug involved, and gradually requires more of the drug to get the same effect. Over time you may need a larger dose to get the same amount of relief. This varies from person to person, some people say they need a higher dose every few weeks, others go years before they feel they need more of the medicine to get the same amount of relief from their pain. Tolerance also happens with other drugs, in addition to opiates. I feel it is very important to use all these terms precisely, so that one communicates to another exactly what one means to say. It is often very difficult to communicate precisely via the written word, we lose facial expressions, etc. that are a part of oral communication. Take care, Annette""Of course, other things can lead to loss of jobs, family issues, etc. With addiction, the connection to improper drug use is pretty clear. Early in addiction it might be harder for everyone involved to tell that the problems in the patient<APO>s life are related to drug use. I think that if a person uses the drugs to manage their pain, and not to get high or to deal with their emotions, that is fine. I have used opiates daily for nearly 15 years, and I don<APO>t feel like they control my life at all. I feel like I use them to make my life better. My friends and family that are aware of my use of medications would agree with that. I don<APO>t tell everyone. Nothing to be ashamed of, just private. Take care, Annette""I think using any medications/treatments to manage pain is a personal decision to me made by the person with the pain and their doctor together. Some people can manage their pain with no drugs at all, some use non-opiate drugs, some use whatever works. What is really the moral difference between using a non-opiate and an opiate drug? Chronic pain is often part of a non-curable condition, what right do I have to judge what another person chooses to do for the rest of their life? I have chosen not to use opiates at one certain stage in my life, now I opt to use them, that may change again before I finally die, I am only 60 years old. I have never considered the pain to be managing me, whether I opt to use opiates or not. Take care, Annette""Back in the early days of the 1970s a doctor prescribed valium for me to help me sleep. At the time, it was the most widely prescribed drug in the world. I had terrible nightmares from it, so after 3 days I stopped taking them and tossed them. I also found they gave me a great high for about 20-30 minutes before I fell asleep. I knew if I were ever going to abuse a drug, valium would be it. I have never taken it again. I have never had a high from an opiate, just takes the edge off of my pain, knocks it down a couple of levels, maybe from a 7-8 to a 4-5 on the good old 0-10 scale. While I was working as a nurse, I opted not to use opiates at all on work days until after I got home. I only used short acting drugs, and never within 8 hours of having to back to work. Looking back, that was nuts, but those were my rules. If you have had a problem with addiction or think it could become a problem, then please be honest with your doctor (assuming it is someone you really trust). I use quite a number of different things that each may bring down my pain levels a point or two. When you add them all up, the total is significant. At this point in my life opiates are part of what I use to make my life doable. I am sure as we all get to know each other you will learn more things that we use to deal with our own pain. Take care, Annette""Hi, FrankXXXX I would only like to comment on your use of tylenol. Taking 4-5 extra strength tylenol at one time can do serious damage to your liver, especially if you do it every evening. Hydrocodone usually comes mixed with tylenol or ibuprofen, so you may be adding even more tylenol at bedtime. I believe that the current recommended dose of tylenol is 1,000 mg. at one time (2 extra strength tablets) and only 4,000 mg. per day, including the tylenol in pills that have it mixed in with other drugs, like Vicodin or Lortab, or even over the counter cold medicines. You may have already cleared this with your doctor, but I would not like other readers here to think it is an okay dose because it is an over the counter medicine. I read recently that acetaminophen (Tylenol) causes more deaths due to accidental overdoses and liver damage than any other drug. Best of luck in your search for a good pain management doctor to help you in your quest for pain relief. Take care, Annette""How can anyone ""unconsciously take more than the daily dose""? I don<APO>t believe anyone who claims they don<APO>t know they are taking extra pills. (just my opinion) What happens when you run out early? I put my meds in daily pill boxes once a week. I put my BT meds in one section of the pill box, when I am out for the day, I am out. I have never asked for a refill early, said my dog ate my pills, had them stolen, etc. I have never given my doctor any reason not to believe that I am an honest, trustworthy patient. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t take benzos because I had a similar episode, unfortunately I now have little memory of about three months of my life. I told my doctor and he took me off of the klonopin using other meds to interrupt the withdrawal process. I felt comfortable telling him about this episode in my life, he did not respond badly at all. He was there for me, and helped me through it. He did not change my other meds at all. I have had problems with antidepressants, I don<APO>t take them anymore either. They affect my memory also, they give me a drug fog, that I at first attributed to Fibro fog. But, when I stopped taking them the fog lifted. I would agree that perhaps the benzo and the antidepressant did not mix well together for you. Or maybe the benzos just are not the right drug for you anymore. It is hard to say. Take care, Annette""This poll was specifically about vicodin, not benzos. Different type of drug altogether. Benzos are very scary drugs, I won<APO>t take them at all. I had bad memory problems once taking them as prescribed. I hate to think what would have happened had I taken extra ones. Opiates taken as prescribed do not affect your memory like benzos do. I can see maybe doing it once, but when you run out of pills early by doing it ""frequently"", wouldn<APO>t you notice? After that, I think people know they are taking them, and make that choice for whatever reason. It is no longer an ""unconscious"" choice. Take care, Annette""HIV can be a chronic illness, many people live for decades without converting to AIDS. I went back and re-read the post, Jeff said his peripheral neuropathy was due to a virus or medicine, he did not say HIV specifically. Take care, Annette""I can<APO>t even imagine mixing benzos and opiates, wow! A nurse practitioner that taught a class for pain management for health care practitioners that I went to a couple of years ago and said that the latest research shows using benzos and opiates conjointly is a really bad idea, very dangerous. She felt that once the data from the latest research is all in, practitioners will no longer prescribe them to the same patients. I can understand why. I keep all my meds in a pill box for each day, so I cannot take more than is prescribed without knowing it. I stop when I run out for the day, I do other things for pain if needed, or tell my doctor. Since I had surgery a bit over two weeks ago, I write down each dose of BT pain meds so I KNOW when the next dose is due. I have done the same thing whenever my meds are changed or things are out of the ordinary. Thank God you are all right. Take care, Annette""No, it is not, that I am aware of. I would call the doctor who did the injection and tell him how you are feeling. He may ask if you have a rash in addition to the itching, difficulty breathing, and he may ask for a list of all the other meds you are taking, prescription and others too. Take care, Annette""I agree with Gail now that you have ruled out any heart problems, you need to continue to seek out other causes of pain. I have bad discs in my neck and the pain I get goes from the shoulder blade deep into the chest. Costochondritis can also cause chest pain. Oral opiates don<APO>t seem to work well in some patients who have had gastric by-pass surgery because they aren<APO>t absorbed as well. If you have been taking the vicodin daily for at least a week, your doctor might try you on a low dose fentanyl patch and see if that is better at controlling this pain. However, if your pain only lasts a few days every couple of weeks, that might not be appropriate for you. You might want to ask your gastric surgeon what kinds of pain meds he recommends for by-pass patients for chronic pain long after their surgery is over with. If he has any suggestions I would appreciate it if you would come back and post again and tell us what does work. This has come up several times on this board without a satisfactory answer. Take care, Annette""Trevor, My primary care doctor is an internist and even she will order an xray of my knee for me so it will be done and ready for the orthopedist when I see him. Especially if I ask for it. I have one knee that has given me pain every 5-7 years, I get an xray, see an orthopedist and wait it out. It always goes away within 8-12 weeks, the xray doesn<APO>t show anything, and the orthopedist has always been fine with that. He holds the MRI out it I ever want it, but so far so good. Trevor, have you actually asked YOUR pcp or orthopedist for an xray and had them refuse you? Or are you a health care worker and discussed it with doctors you know, but do not have a professional relationship with? Just wondering... Take care, Annette""Yes, go see your doctor. Occasionally, some stones are left in the duct and can cause problems down the line. Likely, there is nothing wrong at all, just some random pains, but better to be safe than sorry. Take care, Annette""Best of luck to you with your surgery. I think the more you know ahead of time, the better prepared and the better your expectations are. I think a lot of the time people expect too much from a surgery, and then their disappointment colors their recovery. Hugs, Annette""Mirtazapine is an antidepressant. It also has a side effect of possibly making someone sleepy. If your husband is easily sedated by meds, the combination of all his meds may be making his sleepy during the day. Does one doctor prescribe all the medicines he takes? Make sure if it is more than one doctor, that they all know what he gets from the others. I understand that you fear addiction, and that he gets nervous if they are not there on time in the mail. That is not necessarily a symptom of addiction, he could also just fear that the health issues that he is taking his meds for will come back, along with withdrawal effects, if he does not take his medicine on time. There is no way for any of us to say if he is over medicated or not. I am very concerned about the way you describe him. I would go to his next appt. with him and describe how he seems to you to his doctor, and with him present. Any difference in how a person seems to the family is very important as far as I am concerned. I have been where your husband is, and I did not feel I was different, but my husband and my sister did notice. My sister called my doctor with her concerns. That was a good thing for her to do. If your husband refuses to allow you to go in with him and have this discussion with the doctor, then I would write a letter to the doctor voicing your concerns and send it registered mail so he has to sign for it. That way you know he got it. Your husband may not like this. I feel that any treatment or prescription should improve how a person functions in his life. It does not sound like he is improved to me, from what little you have said. I don<APO>t know if addiction to his meds has anything to do with the changes you see or not, but it needs to be addressed with the doctor. Couples therapy may help both of you to deal with the changes in his life due to his health issues, and communicating better with each other. Please come back and let us know how the two of you are doing. Take care, Annette""Are you currently using anything to even out your leg length difference? My husband had about an inch of difference before he had his THR surgery. He used ""shims"" in his shoes to even things out. His surgeon was fine with that. I expect the PT you go to will suggest that, but you can get insoles for your shoes over the counter. Discuss that with your doctor meantime. My husband never had the fancy, expensive ones made just for him, he just kept adding the over the counter ones until he felt it was right. Take care, Annette""I agree with Kathy. No one your age should live in pain and fear all the time. I am somewhat uneasy with anyone being on klonopin long term, but that is between you and your doctor. It tends to build up in the system over time because of its long half life, and cause over sedation. Just be careful. Keep a journal of your pain, rate it on the 0-10 scale several times a day. Note the things that make it better and the things that seem to make it worse. Write in what time you take your klonopin. I think the key to not being considered a drug seeker is to never ask for specific narcotics. Tell the doctor what kind of pain you have and what activities this prevents you from doing. Emphasize function rather than drugs. Be willing to try non-drug therapies. Tell him what you have tried and if it worked or not. Frankly, I have not had the trouble with doctors thinking I am a drug seeker that some others complain about. I have been on daily narcotic pain meds for well over ten years now. Have you tried things like stretching or heat? I stretch before I even get out of bed, gently moving all my joints through their range of motion. I use my little hot tub all the time, that is my best temporary pain reliever of all. I also think of fibromylagia when someone mentions wide spread pain, and difficulty getting moving in the mornings. For more info about this disorder you might go to www.myalgia.com. They have really good medical info there, they are not selling a cure, just giving out good info. A rheumatologist who cares for a lot of FMS patients is the best place to go for a fibromyalgia examination and diagnosis. Ask them before you make an appt. so you get a doctor who does this kind of care. Some rheumatologists tend to only deal with arthritis and autoimmune disorders. An orthopedic surgeon is the best place to go about your knee. You don<APO>t necessarily need surgery. Often they find the old injury healed and recommend PT or minimal care when it hurts. Don<APO>t consent for any kind of surgery unless you get a second opinion first. Take care, Annette""Make sure you ask the person making appts. if the doctor is a hand specialist. No sense in wasting your time and his if he specializes in backs or large joint replacement. In our community most of the hand specialists are orthopedic surgeons. In some areas, plastic surgeons who enjoy doing reconstructive work are hand specialists. I would go with the doctor who does what you need at lead several times a week. Take care, Annette""Maybe you shouldn<APO>t be driving until you figure this out. No doctor will say see you in the office if you call and say you are having or just had an episode of crushing chest pain with shortness of breath, of course the ER is the place for you to be. I think seeing the cardiologist is a good idea, he can check you over and give you all the necessary tests to see if this is a cardiac event or not. How many of these episodes have you had? I would write it all down and perhaps keep a journal to show the doctor when you see him. Take care, Annette""If the cardiologist cleared me as far as cardiac problems went, then my own pcp made me go to the ER to be sure I was not having a blood clot in my leg/chest, now I would make another appt. with my pcp to further explore my chest pain. I would not make it a secondary problem, but the reason for the visit. This is normal procedure for chest pain, first a cardiologist clears you, then the pcp explores other reasons. Most doctors<APO> offices do not have scanning equipment or ultrasounds, they are in the hospitals in most communities. The fastest way to get to them is via the ER. Many things can cause chest pain besides cardiac problems, but heart disease and clots can kill you so it is wise to eliminate them first. If you are already aware of all this, or just aren<APO>t interested, I apologize ahead of time. Take care, Annette""I wouldn<APO>t expect the pain to go away. Spinal fusion has a fairly low success rate in controlling back pain. I would see your pcp, neurologist, or perhaps a pain management specialist to control your pain. Take care, Annette""I<APO>m sorry, Sara, they were being sarcastic or just kidding. What they meant was that short of knocking you out completely, they could not get rid of your pain for you with drugs. That is not a viable option for anyone. Please come back and share more and hopefully we can share too. What is your diagnosis? Take care, Annette""When you read articles on Google or other search engines, always check the date. Take care, Annette""Where can I read about this, it is something I have never heard of. I will try Google and go from there. Thanks, Annette""I looked briefly and all I found was a ketamine induced coma for RSD that is used in Germany and Mexico. It was in Wikipedia, and the bibliography had articles dated 2010. It said that at that time it was not used in the US at all, as the FDA had not approved ketamine for that use here. Wikipedia mentioned that it worked in 14 out of 41 patients, and mentioned one other patient that got good relief. They also mentioned in one article on another site that one patient ended up paralyzed from the neck down when she woke up and it did not work for her. It is considered a last ditch treatment for RSD only, not for chronic pain in general according to Wikipedia. There was one other site where I would have had to join and pay a monthly fee to read their article, I opted not to. Take care, Annette""Your doctor is not being of much use if he only suggests treatments that are done overseas!!! I am just kidding, all discussion is good. I hope he has made other suggestions that are more helpful to you. Do you have RSD? That was the only kind of chronic pain that I found them using ketamine induced comas for, even overseas. I have always been glad that I didn<APO>t have RSD, or TGN, because that would be so much worse than what I do have. I guess we all are glad that we don<APO>t have something worse than we already have. Take care, Annette""The percocet may not show up at times if you take a low dose and take it quite awhile before, or just before, the test is done. All drug tests have a threshold and if the level of the drug is lower than that, it won<APO>t show up. Check with the company that makes the test they use and ask them why this may happen. Take care, Annette""You should not take that much advil every four hours. I believe that every eight hours is correct for that amount of ibuprofen, but you need to be monitored by your doctor if you are taking even that much. Discuss with your doctor what other choices of treatment are available for your problem. Take care, Annette""You need to see a doctor, none of us can tell what might be wrong with you on line. Just let your doctor know you have a pain that is different than your usual pain. Keep track of when it comes and goes, and any other symptoms you may have with it. The fact that it seems a bit better after you move your bowels or pass gas is important for his diagnosis, so be sure and tell him that. Take care, Annette""Of course, they should not discus any of your medical issues in the waiting room in front of other patients. But, I suspect there is more to this whole thing, I don<APO>t understand why they dismissed your mother??? Take care, Annette""My doctor does not do urine tests, she does a blood test that is sent away to be done. Her asst. draws the blood in the office, it only takes a few minutes. Then they send it off. It measures the amount of each drug present in the blood, so they know if you are taking the proper dosage and if your body is metabolizing it correctly. Using a Walgreen<APO>s over the counter urine drug screening test is not exactly being ""... up to date with the industry."" I don<APO>t have all the answers for this person, we are only hearing one side of the situation, I would be curious to know the whole story. Certainly the office staff should have taken her into an exam room or somewhere private to discuss all this, they broke the HIPAA rules by discussing it out in the waiting area. Take care, Annette""Go to the doctor or the ER if you are still having these pains. Take care, Annette""Actually, I am not in a great deal of pain lately, the last ten years or so. My doctor provides great pain management. I do a variety of things to control my pain, including meds, a hot tub, and exercise. I agree that some people need opiates, and some need higher doses than others, but I do not believe in looking for a doctor based on how high the dose is that you have decided you need. You are correct in saying only you know how much pain you are in, but the doctors went to school and continued their learning by experience and they might know more than we do about what drugs to give us and how much to give, and what other treatments might help. I saw a pain management specialist recently prior to having breast reduction surgery one month ago, he suggested things that I really did not believe would help, but I trusted him and I did what he said, and it worked fine. I have less pain now that I did prior to the surgery, I have already cut my daily amount of methadone in half. No withdrawals, no real increase in pain. I still recommend that one finds a doctor, sticks with that one doctor, and the two of you work together. Take care, Annette""I agree that hyperalgesia is rather rare from my research and from what my doctors have told me. I find it a poor excuse for abandoning opiates right at the start of treatment. I think if after trying several opiates and doses, and carefully evaluating the resulting symptoms and their timing a good doctor can find those cases. I don<APO>t agree that every one needs ""high"" doses of opiates either. I don<APO>t even know what constitutes a ""high"" dose of opiates. That probably varies from one person to another depending on their personal experience. I believe that one should use all types of treatments available to them, and figure out what works best for them. I think that a small amount of relief from each of several treatments will total a significant amount of pain relief. I adore my doctor because she replied a few months ago that ""No one should decrease their activity due to pain."" when I complained that if I increased my dancing to more than an hour a day, I had too much pain. She played with my meds, and I am fine and can do all the dancing I want now. I feel better than I have in years. Take care, Annette""First, please don<APO>t call me ""dear"". I don<APO>t even know you. Plain hydrocodone often is not on insurance formularies, you often have to pay cash for it at a compounding pharmacy from what I have read and heard about it. It is FDA approved, but it is a Schedule II drug according to my drug book when it is provided without any added drugs like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Most people prefer to use other drugs that are covered on their insurance formulary. I do, they are much cheaper for me. I didn<APO>t mention Savella, because it hasn<APO>t been available and widely used for long enough for me to have any opinion at all about it. I won<APO>t try any new drugs until they have been widely prescribed for at least five years. Antidepressants do not work well for me anyway, I have unfortunate side effects, so I won<APO>t ever try it. It is an SNRI as you mentioned, I believe they are not calling it an antidepressant so they can appeal to those with FMS who hate antidepressants. I can also take any drug and tell you how it affected me. Listen to people, more often than not they can do that if they pay attention. But, I don<APO>t believe that anyone can tell how they will respond to a drug or a dose that they have never taken before. Doctors certainly can<APO>t predict how a person will respond to a drug 100% of the time. They are guessing, it is an educated guess if the patient has taken that drug in a different dose before, but still a guess. I hope you find the doctor and the drugs that work for you, so that you can continue working and living in relative comfort. Take care, Annette""Hi, Charles It is always good to see you. As usual we tend to agree on most things. I believe that in a best case scenario really high doses of opiates can be used safely after slowly increasing the dose, and trying other things as well. However, right or wrong, it is really hard to find a doctor who will prescribe really high doses of opiates to new patients. So what happens to those folks if their regular doctor dies or moves away? Or like in this case, got arrested? This is the main reason I have worked hard to keep my opiate doses at a reasonable level AND use other treatments as well. My pain is well controlled, and if something happens to my doctor, hopefully I won<APO>t find myself searching forever for a new doctor. Take care, Annette""How did you come up with the magic dose of 90 mg. a day of methadone? ""Maybe not every day, but most days."" You don<APO>t use methadone that way. You never just take it one way one day and another way the next day. I don<APO>t think most people need really high doses of opiates. I have been on opiates daily for nearly 15 years, and I take less than 10 mg. of methadone three times a day. I don<APO>t believe in looking for a doctor who will prescribe large doses of opiates, although I do recommend finding a doctor who uses opiates as one part of a larger treatment plan. Leave the doctoring to the doctors. Opiates do not work for everyone, or for all kinds of pain. Good luck to you. Take care, Annette""You can get hydrocodone with ibuprofen rather than tylenol. To get it alone you have to get it from a compounding pharmacy according to others who have posted here. I believe it is a Schedule II when prescribed that way. You can also get hydrocodone in a cough syrup of some kind, but it is also mixed with other drugs. Take care, Annette""I have never heard of this side effect. Maybe the doctor can fill us in on what he knows about this. Please, let us know if you find anything. What has your doctor told you? Take care, Annette""I consider any surgical intervention to be the last option. I would try all the oral pain meds first and only if they did not work would I ever consider an implanted device. I don<APO>t have a problem with pain clinics as long as they offer ALL the different kinds of treatments including oral meds. I do have a problem with Pain Clinics that only offer injections and invasive procedures. Take care, Annette""How long were you on Avinza and why did you stop taking it? Did it help at all while you were on it? That is only one long acting opiate, I would try them all before I tried any kind of surgically implanted device. Antidepressants help many people with chronic pain because they mediate the neurotransmitters that carry the pain signals to the brain. They didn<APO>t work for me, but have helped many people I know. Pamelor is one kind of antidepressant, but there are many others to try also. I think I tried 5-6 all together. Hope things get better soon. Take care, Annette""Actiq is a sucker that is supposed to go between your gums and your inner cheek. Only slightly different than sublingual or under your tongue meds. I agree that the best thing is to ask the pharmacy where she got the med for the exact name of the drug, and the dose she was given.""Most MRIs do not show anything wrong in the brain, I sure hope hers doesn<APO>t either. That said, not all migraines or headaches are like the ""classic"" migraines one reads about. I have had migraines for many years, and have never had an ""aura"". It turns out only 10% or so of migraine patients have them. Anyway, I started gabapentin about 10-12 years ago, it<APO>s an anti-seizure med, for a chronic pain condition I have and my unrelated migraines decreased significantly. The side effect of sedation went away after a short time. Wit and see what the MRI shows, then work with the doctor to find the right meds for her. I know you will do the right thing. Take care, Annette""So get a DVD and watch it at home. Do it along with the DVD as long as your doc says it is alright. I have been belly dancing with the TV and DVDs for nearly a year now, it is great. I feel better than I have in years. Take care, Annette""You need to discuss this with your prescribing doctor immediately. Allergic reactions are nothing to fool around with. Take care, Annette""What meds have you tried so far other than ibuprofen? Since you are already depressed, perhaps try Cymbalta or one of the other antidepressants which are used for both depression and chronic pain. What non-drug treatments have you tried already? Take care, Annette""You sound depressed and like you don<APO>t believe they have anything for you that will help. Most drugs cause some side effects, but often those side effects go away after a few weeks. I am on neurontin, it made me feel drunk at first, now, I have no reaction to it at all. But if I stop taking it, I can tell you my pain comes back pronto. The ER is really only good for folks with heart attacks, strokes, and trauma. They deal with the big stuff, and then it is up to you to follow up with whoever they tell you. I suggest you find a doctor you can work with, then stick with that one doctor. Take care, Annette""What about getting Inapsine just before the narcotic? Take care, Annette""As long as you were getting IV pain meds, you would be in the hospital anyway, so getting Inapsine should not be a problem. I used to give/get Inapsine in the ER, and those patients were not on cardiac monitors, I did not experience it as a dangerous drug, either as a nurse giving it, or as a patient getting it. There are side effects to be aware of as with any drugs, of course. Once you go home, perhaps there is a related drug available in oral form that you can take prior to taking your narcotic pain meds, discuss this with your surgeon or your pain management doctor. Inapsine only comes in injectable form, so once someone is out of the hospital, they always end up taking something else. I had surgery recently, and my surgeon asked me to go see a pain management specialist prior to scheduling surgery to get his opinion regarding how best to manage both my chronic and my acute postoperative pain after I had the surgery. My pcp manages my chronic pain, but the surgeon wanted a specialist, so I went to one that I had seen once before. We followed his recommendations and I had very little pain postop, because any pain at all was managed so well before it became severe. All of my doctors were geniuses, in my humble opinion, lol. I have to say that taking ibuprofen a week or two after surgery really has helped my pain. I did not believe that ibuprofen would work so well, but it has. This is because it decreases the inflammation that one gets after surgery so well. Any NSAID would probably work. Intellectually, as a nurse, I knew it should help, but emotionally, as a patient, I did not believe it. It did. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Most day surgery, if you have it done in a hospital rather than a surgery center, is considered a day surgery as long as you are out within 23 hours. Check with the hospital where your surgeon has privileges, to make sure they have a program like this. Most hospitals do. My surgery was considered a day surgery, but I went in one day and came out the next, overnight, but within 23 hours. But if you medically need two days for pain management, then that is what you need and your insurance company should understand that. Your doctor may have to write them a letter explaining why you medically require extra time in the hospital. Most drugs that are given IV or IM do have similar drugs that can be taken orally, ASK your doctors about that, ask a pharmacist also. Explain the situation to a pharmacist and ask him what else you can try. You can then try one dose in the hospital before you go home. Take care, Annette""I had sciatica with pain along the sciatic nerve, from an injection in my backside. My doctor said he had seen that fairly frequently over the years, and put me on a short course of oral steroids. It worked for me. Discuss it with him if you haven<APO>t already tried that. Take care, Annette""You need to take the time to go in and see a doctor about your ankle changing color and your worsening pain. It is illegal for a doctor to call in a RX for a narcotic unless he has seen you. If your orthopedic doctor hasn<APO>t seen you in quite awhile, that may be why his office won<APO>t call in a stronger pain med for you. I am actually more concerned about the changing color in your ankle, that needs to be assessed. Take care, Annette""I would see a neurologist who works with headache patients. I assume you have stopped having periods, but if you have not, you need to ad to your headache journal the days your periods start and end. I would see one neurologist and stick with him/her. Find one you like and feel that you can work with. I had horrible migraines for many years, age 35 to age 53, then I finally went through menopause, that helped some. Take care, Annette""Congrats to your sister for being a recovering addict, instead of an active one. That is a hard path, and you should be very proud of her. Because tramadol does not cause any kind of buzz or high, it is thought to be safe for addicts to use as far as triggering any addiction problems. It does use the same opiate receptors in the brain as opiates do. It can cause a withdrawal syndrome in some folks. So can many other drugs, like antidepressants. I think your sister needs to make this decision on her own with her doctor. As long as she told them she was an addict, and had that discussion with them, I would trust her doctor. If she was seen at the ER she needs to tell them EVERY time she goes there, as they don<APO>t always have access to all her old records, and even a particular ER doctor may not remember her from the last time she saw him. I took tramadol for many years and never had any kind of withdrawal symptoms when I stopped taking it, or any kind of buzz when I was taking it. It is usually prescribed for mild to moderate pain. Take care, Annette""I apologize for my poor communication. By ""buzz"" I meant a high like opiates give not a buzz like feeling. I have never met an opiate addict who was willing to accept tramadol and whatever feeling it might give one rather than the real ""high"" that they get from opiates. Also for Anon<UD>54432 and the comment about addiction and severe withdrawals, I would suggest reading about the difference between addiction and dependence. Withdrawals have to do with dependence not addiction. Many non-addictive drugs cause withdrawals. Addiction is a compulsive use of a substance for something other than what the doctor prescribed it for, and in spite of negative consequences in ones life due to using that drug. We all respond to drugs differently. Take care, Annette""I think you need to approach the doctor with it as a functional problem, tell him what you cannot do due to the pain you have. Then leave it up to him to decide what to do after he examines your knee. He may suggest strengthening exercises, or PT, or some kind of medication. You said PT helped before, it may be you need to go back for awhile, or perhaps they could show you how to do the exercises at home. NSAIDs have an analgesic effect fairly quickly, but it takes about three weeks of taking one on a set schedule to lessen or to get rid of inflammation, according to my doctor. He said that was how to get the maximum pain relief. He might suggest you not take Ibu or Aleve just when it hurts, but on a set schedule for awhile and see if that helps. You have to remember that Vicodin just covers up the perception of pain, it does not address the cause at all. Whether it is appropriate in your case depends on what is going on, and the doctor will need to examine your knee and talk to you before he decides. It might be all you need to get over this hump in your recovery. But, it might not be also. Take care, Annette""Do not do anything without seeing your doctor first. Did you not read the part where I told you to see your doctor and let him examine your knee before deciding to do anything? I hate it when people read things on the internet, then decide to diagnose and treat themselves. My doctor went to medical school then attended a long residency program, she knows a lot of stuff that I don<APO>t. She is a valuable part of my team. So is your doctor. Take care, Annette""10-15 mgs. of hydrocodone is not a really high dose. It is fine to be on it for years as long as your doctor is supervising you and monitoring your health issues. I took it for over ten years, and I did not develop any addiction problems. The latest medical studies showed less than 1% of those who used opiates for pain as prescribed by their doctors became addicted to them. That is a pretty low side effect rate. Addiction or other side effects are why you should have a doctor<APO>s supervision, which you pretty much have to have as he/she is writing your RXs. Be aware, but don<APO>t be scared to control your pain. Take care, Annette""That is just not true. Yes, the 325 is the amount of tylenol in the pill. Since those are available in 10/325, taking two pills only gives you 750 mg. of tylenol. She was asking for a very small RX number of pills, 10 or 15. She wants to take them occasionally according to her. I took about five 10/325 pills a day for years, and my liver is just fine. I was still taking far less than the recommended amount of tylenol per day which is 4,000 mg. and the recommended individual dose is 1,000 mg. My personal opinion is that I would rather not take more than 2,000 mg. of tylenol per day long term. I have my doctor check my liver function tests regularly to make certain my liver is fine and it remains so. I no longer take that medicine for other reasons. I don<APO>t use tylenol in any other products, RX or over the counter. It is important to read labels and add up all the tylenol you take if you use a lot of different products. The 4,000 mg. includes ALL the tylenol one takes. Take care, Annette""Well said. Take care, Annette""Go see a doctor. None of us can diagnose you on line, no one can, not even a doctor. He has to examine your leg and see just what you have done. Take care, Annette""Although I do not have low back pain, I have had too many scans to count on my head for migraines, and my neck for DDD. I find them to be useless most of the time. I understand why doctors do them when you say you ""have the worst headache of your life"", and learned not to ever say those words. I finally found a doctor about 15 years ago that will tell me how the results of a scan will change my treatment plan. She also respects my wishes to avoid scans unless the results will affect my treatment plan. I do not do them just for academic reasons. If it won<APO>t change my treatment plan, I don<APO>t do it anymore. Not just scans, but also all invasive things. Take care, Annette I had one spinal surgery on my C5-6 disc when I lost function in my right hand. That was the only time I feel I really needed a scan done.""MRIs (magnetic resonance imaging) do not use radiation. Some other scans do, like CTs. Regular xrays of course. I have never heard of worrying about breathing radiation before. Xray techs, and nurses who work in radiation cover themselves with lead vests, thyroid covers, etc. I have had a complete bone scan, but only once, I might be concerned if I was to have a bunch of them. I have had a number of CT scans, I worry more about those as they use more radiation than a plain xray. I think the thing to think of is how much you are risking if you choose to not have it. It is all about the potential risk/benefit ratio. Take care, Annette""I use reglan 10 mg. and aspirin 975 mg.or compazine 10 mg. for migraines and they work pretty well for me. Narcotics are a poor choice for migraines as they often cause rebound headaches, and most folks with migraines can<APO>t function well on narcotics anyway. The above meds made me a bit sleepy at first, but after a little while even that went away. The best med for a migraine is one that interrupts the pain so you can continue to do whatever it is you do. I would see a pain management specialist who uses many forms of treatments, not just injections and invasive procedures for your other pain. Many of them do not do migraines, so ask first, or have a different doctor do those. But if you do that, make sure the two doctors communicate well with each other. Take care, Annette""I agree with Swank, there are tylenol type products, and NSAIDs like aspirin, ibuprofen and aleve available over the counter. None of those should be taken long without a doctor<APO>s supervision because of possible negative side effects. You may not need an MRI. I have occasional pain in the back of my left upper arm. My doc found the trigger point and injected it once with a steroid/marcaine mix, that fixed it up for about six months. Otherwise I use ibuprofen products, which she knows about. Take care, Annette""I think you should talk to your pcp and ask him what to do. Let him call the other doctors and he can write your RXs if they won<APO>t do it and he feels it is appropriate. TGN is a horribly painful condition, but I doubt it has anything to do with the meds you took and how they were changed. Take care, Annette""You can ask you old PT person what they would suggest. Or your doctor. I started belly dancing lessons last April using a program on TV called ""Shimmy"", then bought instructional DVDs on line. I am up to 1-1/2 hours a day, most days. I do it because it is fun. Start slow, with your doctor<APO>s approval, and do something you will enjoy too much to avoid. I hate exercise. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t believe myself that we with FMS are more prone to infections and allergies than others. I rarely catch anything infectuous, even colds. The allergies I have with the exception of hay fever I had many years ago prior to having FMS.The hay fever came with moving to Oregon, my doctor told me that was common. Low thyroid is something that can happen, my doctor checks mine yearly and it has always been normal. I let my eye doctor know about my FMS, he was glad to know about it, said my need for glasses had to do with getting older not the FMS. He seemed to be more aware about FMS than many doctors. Vertigo, I had with an inner ear infection many years before the FMS. I would go to an ENT and get checked out. My brother does not have FMS, but he does have a problem with his ears ringing. My personal belief is that FMS is a pain amplification syndrome that is neurologically based. Tender points and fatigue are part of it, and one can have many co-morbid conditions that are not necessarily part of FMS. Please believe that FMS does not include EVERY symptom that EVERY person with FMS has EVER had. Take care, Annette""Find a pediatrician that you trust and stick with him/her. You might try seeing a pediatric gastrologist if you haven<APO>t already. I would try one at a university teaching hospital if you can. Do not be surprised if they ask her to see a psychiatrist, it does not mean that they don<APO>t believe her, chronic pain like she has had can affect everything about the development of a small child. They may want to just see how she is sealing with all of this. Let her go if they suggest it. Was she potty trained, is she having accidents if she was already? Is it possible she has been molested? Sometimes that can cause problems with urination and bowel movements and abdominal pain. There are usually other signs also, but check it out. It isn<APO>t the end of the world if she has been, it will just feel that way to you. I went through it with my son, he is a great guy. Keep in touch. Take care, Annette""Nothing to be sorry about on his behalf. He moved on years ago, had some therapy and joined the Marines as he had always planned. He did three tours of duty in Afghanistan and Iraq,got through that okay too. As far as molestation goes, it can happen. Unless she has been glued to your side 24/7 it could happen with a friend of the family that is visiting, a workman doing work at your house, neighborhood kids over to play. Even relatives. Be very watchful. I hope the GI guy can find something through the scope, and fix it. Take care, Annette""I would just go along with the surgeon who did your revision, and perhaps see a chronic pain specialist. I don<APO>t know how your right leg is getting longer by 2 mm. since the surgery. Look on a ruler and see how small 2 mm. actually is. If it is really bothering you and you believe it may be causing more pain for you, you might go see a podiatrist for a lift to be put in the shoe of the other leg to even them out. My husband wore lifts in the shoe of his bad leg until he got his hip replaced and the surgeon evened the length out. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Marijuana is illegal according to the federal government, that trumps all state and local laws. If they want to they can prosecute anyone for possessing it. Many doctors say no mixing opioids with marijuana, no matter what. Some doctors say anything ""in moderation"", that is what they told me ten years ago. But they won<APO>t write you an application for the medical marijuana card. It is crazy. Why did you wait to ask us what to do until the last minute? Take care, Annette""I replied to you several days ago, and apparently my post disappeared into cyberspace as they sometimes do. Although many of us use opiate meds including me, I am always open to hearing other options for controlling pain. The only exception to that is religion for me. I usually just skip those posts. I just do not believe that God will help individuals in pain based on how hard they pray. I am open and more than willing to hear of any pain control treatments based on medical evidence. Bring it on! Take care, Annette""Okay, now I do see my previous response. Sorry to repeat myself. Take care, Annette""I realize that most people on this board, me included, use opioids for chronic pain, as at least a part of our treatment plan. I have been here a long time and welcome any kind of chronic pain treatment anyone has to offer. I disagree with you regarding not discussing non-opioid treatments on this board. I for one will welcome any suggestions you have. Take care, Annette""Well said, Doctor. I really believe that if each treatment modality one tries gives even a small amount of relief, then when you total up 4-5 modalities the relief will be worthwhile. Thanks, Annette""OUCH!!! I don<APO>t know of anything over the counter that would work better than ice. I know that there is a lidocaine topical product, but you would have to ask your doctor about that as you would need a prescription. Take care, Annette""I would call the doctor or clinic where they plan to do these injections and explain it to them, see what they say. If they have to change the date of the procedure, they will know to do that before you actually get there. Take care, Annette""I would go back to my family doctor or pcp. Let him fight these battles and decide what tests need to be ordered. If the specialists have not found anything within their field of expertise they won<APO>t go further. Take care, Annette""Of course, his parents should call his surgeon and explain what is going on. This happened to my nephew also after he had scheduled ortho surgery in the hospital, and had several days to switch over to oral meds and did fine. But one night after going home, he just started screaming in pain. Of course, then he had side effects to the Lortab, and itched inside his cast, also miserable. We got past that though, and worked things out without him going back to the hospital. The doctor should have plenty of suggestions of things to do, including adjusting his pain meds as needed. Take care, Annette""Thanks for the link to this article. It was very interesting reading. It is always good to read about research that is being done now. Take care, Annette""If you are seeing the dentist or doctor often enough to get tramadol ""every day"" of your life, I would put some of that money towards fixing what is wrong. My mom worked out a payment plan with her dentist when she was in her late 50s, she paid so much a month no matter what he did. It took her well into her 60s to get her teeth all in order and get the dentist paid off. For many years she put whatever money she had towards her five kids<APO> health care needs, including dentistry. Another option might be to find out if there are any dental schools near you and see if you can get dental work done that way. My brother didn<APO>t have dental insurance, and he used that route. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""One other suggestion I have is to try not to look at the whole picture as far as all the dental work you might need and the huge cost involved. Do one tooth at at time. Often dealing with a smaller goal makes things easier. Take care, Annette""I am so happy for you!!! Dental work should be part of any comprehensive health care plan, but it is often overlooked due to cost and lack of insurance. If you can<APO>t eat properly and get decent nutrition, the rest of your body will suffer. Best of luck with the new dentist. Bless your mother-in-law for helping. Take care, Annette""Or call your OB doc and see if he can see you sooner. If you have a fever, go straight to the ER. Take care, Annette""You need to see your doctor and/or a pain management specialist to try and get ahead of the pain. There are lots of medications and other treatments you could try. Compression fractures are very painful for quite a long while until they heal. Take care, Annette""I think they were probably talking about older posts of mine in other threads. Actually, I have not had any trouble in regard to refusing new drugs that have not been widely prescribed yet. I told my doctor that at the beginning of our relationship about 15 years ago. I have occasionally reminded her not to bother me with new drugs, lol. Now, she remembers. Everything I currently use is available in generics. Cheaper and older drugs, win, win. I don<APO>t use antidepressants or benzos because they either do not work well for me, or I have had bad side effects already. Savella and Nucynta both fall into that category for me. I have not even tried them and probably never will. By the way, I don<APO>t think Celebrex has sulfa (not sulfur) in it, it is just one of the drugs that crosses over for folks with allergies or sensitivities to sulfa drugs. So, if you are allergic/sensitive to something in the sulfa drug class, Celebrex is probably not the best drug for you. There is also some crossover between penicillin drugs and cephalosporins. These are just some of the interactions that pharmacists learn about, I like to think of my pharmacist as a good member of my health care team. I am getting totally of the track now, so I will say good night. Take care, Annette""Hi, Charles Of course, if my life depended on it, I might try some cancer curing drug, but not most new drugs. I am so glad that using fentanyl allowed you to continue to work and do the things you love. However, as a nurse, I have seen far too many drugs recalled during that first five year period, and/or no longer marketed in the same way because of side effects that the drug companies either did not know about during their previous testing, or just didn<APO>t tell us about. It has been okay for drug companies to hide research that did not go their way for far too many years. This change came about, as I recall, at the beginning of the AIDS era, when people wanted a fast track for life saving drugs. The FDA gave it to them. But later the drug companies fast tracked not so important drugs. It is up to every patient and their doctor to make these kinds of decisions for themselves. It is okay for each of us to differ on what risks we are willing to take, depending on our own situations. Take care, Annette""I think they are typical statements because they might be true statements. Please see a different pain management specialist, I would see one who uses oral meds in addition to interventional treatments. I think when you find that each of several interventions drops your pain a couple of levels that the total amount of relief is worth it. If drinking excessive amounts of alcohol fixed your pain, you would not have written in this community. I am an old retired RN, I cannot tell you how many folks have told met hat alcohol did not fix their pain. I have never met anyone who said it worked out well and cured their pain. I don<APO>t know if you are an alcoholic or just chasing your pain with alcohol. Try not drinking for awhile and see what happens. Take care, Annette""You see those kinds of patients because that is what you do for a living, day in and day out. Back in the day when I worked as an RN in a drug treatment facility, it got so I could spot a heroin addict down the block just by checking out his eyes. When they seemed to be everywhere, I changed jobs. That was only after about 3-5 years of doing that job, I was young and wanted a change anyway. I totally agree that opiate treatment should be a last choice option, not a first choice. But many of us have tried all of those other options already, when it is time to use opiates, use them properly. Go to a good doctor that will monitor the meds correctly, and monitor your health issues also. Addiction is actually rather rare when one considers the huge numbers of people who use opiates for pain. The latest quote in my nursing journal was less than 1%, before that it was only 3-5% depending on the study. That is a very small % for any side effect at all. I have personally used opiates daily for at least 15 years, I am not addicted by any definition of the word. I have personally never met a doctor who prescribed opiates as a first choice for chronic pain of any kind. They must be out there somewhere, I just have not met them. Take care, Annette""Great comments. We really have to take some responsibility for our medical care. If we can come to boards like this one, we can do basic searches on our health issues and learn all we can. I have been fortunate in my doctors, they go to continuing education seminars and learn every time. They do not get enough of this type of training in medical school. Take care, Annette""Other people post and complain that they can<APO>t get opiates in Florida because of all the drug abusers??? I don<APO>t know, I live on the West Coast. Take care, Annette""You never have to take more than was prescribed to you. First you see your doctor and explain what is going on. I think we pretty much agree on that. Drug abuse and drug use for pain management are two very different things. It is hard for some folks to feel sorry about drug abusers who die due to their own poor choices. I personally do not know these people or the lab results from their autopsies, so I don<APO>t judge them. I personally think addiction is a much more difficult illness to overcome than chronic pain, just my personal opinion. Take care, Annette""Hi again, I have FMS, DDD, and migraines. I have used cervical traction with good relief for pain in the past shortly after having cervical surgery for a bad disc. The surgery was not for pain, but for improved function, which I got. I tried many other treatment modalities from PT, and OT, to non-opioid drug therapies. Lidoderm patches are a God-send for me. But, I do take opioids at this point in time along with the other things I do. My hot tub is my favorite place to be. Cognitive behavioral therapy has also been a wonderful tool for me to use to help myself. I used this when antidepressants proved to be a bad choice for me. Please stay and share any tools you have. Take care, Annette""Cervical traction consisted of a device on the top of a door that held a rope that was connected to my head and a bag of water on the other end. I sat in a chair under the device and it pulled my head and neck straight, and seemed to relieve pressure on my spine. Cognitive behavioral therapy is a series of techniques one uses to change their reactions to what may happen to them or what they are feeling. If you react differently and think differently, you WILL end up feeling differently. It take time and personal work, but I feel it is a great thing. It has been for me and for many other folks. I used a book my therapist gave me called ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns, MD. It is a self help book and you can use it on your own for the most part. The newer editions also have drug information about medications you might use also. CBT is a widely used therapy, it is not one of those things that is in vogue to sell books for a few months then disappears. I most recently bought the book for a friend and it cost around $25 at Borders Bookstore. Take care, Annette""Whatever helps you is great. Discuss it all with your doctor. Take care, Annette""I would see a pain management specialist, perhaps your pcp works with a particular group? I would see one who uses many kinds of treatments, not just injections and other invasive treatments. I would also let your pcp know about the ankle swelling when you are on your feet all day. This is NOT normal. Is your blood pressure normal? Do you smoke? Please keep in touch. Take care, Annette""I would definitely tell your pcp about the ankle swelling. It may be related to your high blood pressure. Is your BP now normal on meds, or is it still high? Take care, Annette""My understanding is that the goal of BP meds is to reduce the BP to the normal range. You aren<APO>t there yet. It sounds like you already know the proper range for normal, less than 140/90 is pre-hypertensive. Both numbers need to be lower, not just one to even get close to normal (120/70). Keep after all this with your doctor. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""I would let your doctor know about this even if the pain has gone away by the time you see him. Can you feel any lumps or bumps there? You don<APO>t say if you are male or female or your age. Take care, Annette""You have had four episodes of rib fractures in less than 3 months? Just from coughing? Why are you coughing? Are they treating the cough to prevent the fractures? Do you have osteoporosis or any other kind of bone problem that might cause fractures? I am glad you quit smoking, that really helps bones heal faster. It may account for some of your coughing, smokers frequently cough up more gunk shortly after quitting. But of ocurse, it should not cause fractures. Have they checked you for lung and bone cancer? They would probably do scans rather than draw blood for that. Please keep in touch and let me know how you are doing. Take care, Annette""I can see why you were coughing so much, but why was it causing broken ribs? I hope all goes well for you and the morphine works to control your pain. Keep in touch. Take care, Annette""Forteo is usually prescribed for osteoporosis. Did your bone density test show any osteopenia? Was your bone density test completely normal? What kind of bone density test did you have? Some are better than others from what I have read. Have you been on steroids or similar type drugs that can cause bone thinning as a side effect? Take care, Annette""Sorry, I don<APO>t know who Terrel Owens is, I assume he is some kind of athlete? How can you tell you have a swelling under your ribs? Sounds creepy. I would just keep after the doctors until you get an answer. I have run out of things that I would suspect right away. Keep in touch. Take care, Annette""Did the xrays and CT not show any fractures, or did they show nothing else but new fractures, and nothing that could have caused them? Best of luck with your regular doctor, when will you be able to see the rheumy? Take care, Annette""Hi, Tim I replied a couple of days ago, but the post didn<APO>t go through, I guess. What did your rheumatologist say, and did he give you enough pain management to keep you functional? Take care, Annette""I had surgery at C5-6 due to a functional deficit, six months later I had an MRI that showed a new herniation at C6-7. I opted not to have surgery as all I had was pain and no functional problems. It healed by itself. A fusion may or may not help chronic pain, it should help address any functional deficits. Do your research first. I also used short courses of steroids orally, maybe two weeks at a time once or twice a year. Some doctors frown on this, but it worked for me. I am a nurse also, no longer working due to chronic pain issues, I cannot imagine working with patients with low back pain. Kudos to you!!! While I continued to work I only took NSAIDs, once I stopped working, my nurse buddy told me that now I could manage my pain the way I would advise patients to manage theirs. She was right!!! That was many years ago, now employers and the nursing board are more understanding about using pain management drugs and also working. One does not preclude the other in most states, like it did when I stopped working. I would suggest you try a short acting opioid after work, and/or at bedtime to start out. That may be all you need at this point in time. I used a long acting opioid just right before bedtime for a long while, I didn<APO>t feel like I needed it during the day back then. Talk about all this with a good nurse friend that you can count on if you have one who knows the rules in your state. Or call the nursing board and talk directly to them. Then discuss this all with your doctor. Always maintain a good relationship with your own doctor, they know you far better than we do. Take care, Annette""Things heal on their own sometimes. Good for you!!! Take care, Annette""I agree with Johnathon, don<APO>t tempt your hubby. Keep all meds locked up all the time. This also keeps kids that may be living in or visiting your home safe. I don<APO>t think you even need to tell your hubby what meds you might decide to take. Mine didn<APO>t know for many years, and even now I doubt he could tell you. Talk to your rheumy, explain what things you would like to be able to do that your pain prevents you from doing? If the doctor just looks at you and has nothing to try, suggest opiates gently. Just ask if there is any kind of pain medicine that might help you? Ask if you can just give them a try and see how they work if you have tried everything else. I have FMS, I tried everything else, and I use opioids for pain successfully. I do suggest you try everything else first, see if it works. Take care, Annette""I would see a physical therapist first of all, and get an evaluation to make sure your spine, hips, etc. are all in good order. Take care, Annette""While I agree that weight around the gut is dangerous, I think far more study is needed to tell if weight loss will help the pain of a particular individual. I agree it may be the chicken or the egg question. It may be the only way to find out is to lose the weight and see what happens. I have FMS, by far most of my pain is due to that. Fifteen years ago I lost 65 pounds, and it made no difference to my pain levels at all. I regained the weight as most people do. Over the last few years I have lost about 50 pounds, slowly but surely. Not on purpose, it has just happened. My doctor tested me and made sure nothing was wrong. I have increased my activity levels over the last year, but again until I had surgery recently, my pain levels remained the same. After breast reduction surgery, my back and shoulder pain decreased to the point of near non-existence. But my leg and hip pain remain the same. FMS is not affected by weight loss according to most resources I have read. Chronic pain can be caused by many different things, some related to obesity and others not. I do feel better generally now that I am 50 pounds lighter, I hope I continue to lose weight. I discovered belly dancing. I do it along with the TV or with DVDs for an hour a day, most days. I worked up to that slowly and have found that making time to do it is the hardest but once I get started, I thoroughly enjoy myself. It is hard to quit once I am dancing. I feel you have to do something active that you really enjoy. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t think most people understand what a physically demanding job nursing is. You use your brain a lot but you also are lifting and helping people move around all day (or night) long. I was lucky and only had one severe back injury in 40 years. I have been gradually losing weight the last few years, and started exercising regularly. I do notice the increase in range of motion and ease of moving around that comes with regular exercise, but neither exercise nor weight loss has decreased my pain. Adding exercise increased my pain, fortunately my doctor adjusts my meds as needed. Recent breast reduction surgery helped decrease my daily pain enough to cut my methadone in half. I hope that stays the same or continues to improve. 70 kilos in 18 months is impressive, good for you. Try to work in some kind of exercise as soon as your doctor okays it. You can do it again. Take care, Annette""I agree with you, however people are also offended when you ask them not to smoke in the house, the car, or around their kids. Let alone quitting for their own health. This happens no matter how nicely you bring it up. Studies have shown that it is still worthwhile to mention quitting smoking to patients repeatedly, preferably at every appt., they end up quitting more often than folks who have doctors who never mention it. I personally feel the same way about weight, if it seems like it even might become a problem, doctors should bring it up. In the ER we always weighed patients as we brought them to their guerneys, because we need an accurate weight for some medicines. Of course it would be offensive if a doctor or a nurse just said ""You are getting fat, you should loose weight."" But, if they instead offered a healthy plan of eating and activity that was attainable, I think fewer people would take offense. I agree that if you are 20 pounds overweight but otherwise healthy and fit, it might not matter, but that 20 pounds can lead to another 20 pounds, etc. I was never 20 pounds overweight that I can remember, I was closer to 100 pounds overweight for the last 40 years, and few doctors ever mentioned it to me. I rarely get sick, and other than my chronic pain condition I am generally healthy, but carrying that extra weight will shorten my life. I am not dumb enough to think otherwise. The studies are extensive. I started worrying about the extra weight when my good friend developed type II diabetes and her sister, my best friend, was diagnosed as pre-diabetic within a year or two of each other. They are obese also. I don<APO>t want things like that to happen to any of us. Take care, Annette""They are not doing their jobs very well then. I last worked in Nevada in the ER, and before that in Calif. I also volunteered for 9 years at a free out-patient clinic here in Oregon. Nearly every doctor I worked with discussed quitting with smokers. Old, young, didn<APO>t seem to make much difference. Perhaps it is a geographical difference, I am on the West Coast. I know that as I moved from state to state, there were other practices that were very different. I have a nurse friend that smokes similarly to you, as have many of my Hispanic patients, who often smoke only one or two cigarettes per day. My friend also runs marathons, she was smoking about 3 cigarettes a day, when I last worked with her 15 years ago. She has been unable to stop completely. A half a pack a day may be light smoking but it is enough to make you ill with cancer in many forms, and heart disease too. I suspect you already know that, but please quit smoking for your own good health. My mom only smoked a half a pack a day, she died at age 69 from lung cancer. Please don<APO>t go down that path. Take care, Annette""Hi, Beth I have been thinking of you lately, and wondering where you have been. I am so glad to see you again. My surgery went great, I have cut my methadone in half since then, and am using less BT meds most of the time. I do not have the back pain and shoulder pain I had before the breast reduction surgery. 98% of my pain now is in my legs and hips. The goal was to reduce my pain and that has been accomplished. In addition to that I have the breasts of a 25 year old, lol. So, it is all good. I was able to continue my belly dancing in the lower body the whole time, although I did reduce it to every other day at first, I am back to daily workouts of at least an hour. After five weeks, the surgeon told me I could slowly add chest isolations back into my routine, and could begin walking dogs for the animal shelter again, as long as I started with smaller dogs. I do that once a week. She won<APO>t permit me to use my hot tub until 8 weeks have passed since the surgery. Some silly theory about the incisions burning because I can<APO>t feel the heat there. Every site I have found says one can get in the hot tub after the incisions are healed, or 4-6 weeks post op. I know that will really help me alot. I am only sleeping 3-4 hours, as opposed to 6-7 hours with the hot tub just before bedtime. I have been really witchy due to sleep deprivation, lol. I already take Ambien for sleep, I am not taking anymore drugs. Now that I am so much more active, my pain has increased in my legs a bit, but I am determined to control it without increasing my opioids. We will see... I am so glad to hear that Kevin has returned home and is as supportive as usual. I hope the current computer holds up for you. I am looking forward to reading your posts. Have your torn internal sutures healed? Hugs, Annette""I didn<APO>t think my insurance would pay for the surgery either (at least their share of it). But my surgeon had no trouble getting it approved at all. I have Medicare Advantage insurance, it only covers basic Medicare stuff, plus a bit extra if you ever get stuck in the hospital. If you have shoulder/neck issues, it may well be covered. I hated having to buy orthopedic bras, when I could find them in my size for cheap. Easier now than 10 years ago. I have to really change my mindset now, I still look at bras from my old point of view. Now I can wear little nothing bras, or racer back bras (they really hurt my shoulders before), or even just wear a chemise. I haven<APO>t had a C cup since I was a teenager. I waited until after my nursing days, then I had to raise my child, then I became ill and wouldn<APO>t even consider an elective surgery. I wish now I had done it 30 years ago. My doctor<APO>s MA had hers done in her late 20s and is so pleased with it. I had minimal pain, I saw a PM specialist prior to surgery, and he made suggestions to my surgeon about how to medicate me post op. I have to say I had really minimal pain as I followed the med instructions he gave me, I rarely took as much BT medicine as he suggested. I did decrease the methadone without calling my pcp first, I tapered down slowly starting about two weeks post op. I saw her for a regularly scheduled visit about 6 weeks post op. She and I are both very happy with the outcome. Go see a good plastic surgeon that you have checked out ahead of time, or even better two surgeons for two opinions. Let them make suggestions to you and your insurance company. See what they say, then decide for yourself what to do. We all follow different paths in life, and you are certainly smart enough to decide which one you will choose for yourself. Hugs, Annette""I assume you saw your pcp or some kind of MD when you were injured the first time, and again this time???I would make an appt. and go back and see him/her again. They have found recently that multiple concussions in young people can cause serious problems as life goes on. Please do not self-diagnose or self-treat. A sports trainer or coach does not substitute for an MD. Take care, Annette""You need to see your doctor. Only a complete exam and medical history can help you and your doctor make a diagnosis. Take care, Annette""Does Subutex also contribute to opioid-induced hyperalgesia? Take care, Annette""You can get used Tai Chi, Yoga and other exercise books or DVDs at thrift stores, so money is no excuse for that. I used my bath tub for hot soaks until I got my little hot tub, that works better. My drug handbook for advanced practice nursing, 2010 edition, lists subutex as a class III opioid analgesic. It goes on to say that the pills are intended for treating opioid dependency and the injectable is for moderate to severe pain. Be aware that once drugs are approved by the FDA for one use, the doctor may prescribe them any way he sees fit for whatever he wishes, unless the FDA has specifically prohibited it. This is called off label use. My understanding of the information here is that it reacts on certain opiate receptors in the CNS, but that it also has a partial antagonist activity that can precipitate withdrawals in someone already taking opiates. The book suggests waiting until one has opiate withdrawal symptoms before starting oral treatment. I have no experience with this drug. My personal feeling is that it might be useful for addiction treatment, like methadone is, as a substitute for opiates while the patient is doing other recovery activities or treatments. I am not convinced that this is a good drug for chronic pain. Just my opinion, we all have one. I am awaiting the good Doctor<APO>s opinion on the hyperanalgesia caused by this drug? Take care, Annette""Hi, Charles From what I have read, Naloxone is a 100% opioid antagonist and Subutex is a mixed agonist/antagonist??? As such they would be used very differently. I happen to agree with you about the frequency of opioid induced hyperalgesia. I also think you can diagnose it by using a pain journal and noting exactly when one has increased pain compared to when one takes their opioids, not sure though. maybe the doctor can fill us in on how one diagnoses this. Take care, Annette""Thank you, Doctor. Take care, Annette""I can only suggest that you keep your foot/ankle elevated higher than your heart as much as possible. This may not be possible at work, but as soon as you get home, lay down flat and put your foot up on a couple of couch pillows if possible. Even if you are not on your feet at work, if your feet are in a dependent position (lower than your heart) they will have at least some swelling, internal or external, that will cause pain. I agree with Charles that pain meds used properly have a low incidence for side effects, including addiction. I believe in using meds when needed. That said there are not enough opiates in the world to get rid of your pain if you don<APO>t elevate that foot! No problem that I see in doing both things, taking meds, and elevating your foot. Discuss this with your new orthopedist or GP. Take care, Annette""Methadone was developed in Germany during WWII when they could not get enough morphine for their wounded soldiers. It was used exclusively for pain back then. Then in the late 1960s it was discovered that it could also be used to help opiate addicts recover. It was used as a substitute for the heroin that most addicts were using back then. Once the patient got therapy of some kind and had their life in order, they could be tapered off of the methadone, or they could stay on it for the rest of their lives. One of my first nursing jobs was in a heroin addiction treatment center that used methadone as one option for treatment. At the same time it was being used for pain in terminal patients in hospitals and at home. Fast forward to last year, I have several chronic pain conditions and I was on MS Contin (generic) as my long acting pain med. Methadone was far cheaper, and I did not want to hit that donut hole for Medicare Part D, so I asked my doctor to switch me from morphine to methadone. No big deal, I swtiched over slowly and adjusted my methadone dose until my pain was controlled. I did not notice any difference in pain control at all. I consulted with a pain management specialist recently and he was fine with my treatment plan that my pcp and I were using, and made some suggestions for an upcoming surgery. I asked him about an EKG to screen for some methadone, dose related, heart effects. He was not worried, he said at my dose he would not expect any problems and suggested getting a baseline EKG and then one yearly. After having breast reduction surgery 7 weeks ago, I decreased my methadone. I ended up taking half as much as before surgery. That is my present treatment plan with oxycodone for BT pain. I am also using a tad bit less of that, than I was prior to surgery. I had no withdrawal symptoms when I decreased my methadone slowly to the present level over a few weeks. I still take neurontin, and zolpidem, but that is it for now. Are you an addict who also requires pain management? Or were you already dependent of opiates for pain? If you have any addiction issues, I would be sure to see an addiction treatment specialist in addition to your pain management doctor. Take care, Annette""We all respond differently to drugs of all kinds, what works for one may not work for another. I am glad you are finally in a place where you at least feel mentally clear, and have lost weight. However, I have been on methadone for a year plus a few months, and I am mentally clear, and have also lost weight slowly but surely. I don<APO>t know why, but I am glad. My doc checked my labs and all is well, so I am just enjoying being more active and enjoying life even more than I was before. I lost several months of my life to antidepressants, I have no memory of that time at all. So, I don<APO>t take antidepressants at all anymore, but I know they do help many people, so I would never tell someone not to take them. Each of us has to decide for ourselves WITH our doctors what meds or other treatments to use. Opioids do not fix anything, they only change our perception of pain. That works for me. Take care, Annette""I had the same thing. The orthopedist went through all the usual treatments, no relief with rest, splints, injections, etc. After three or four months, he finally did the surgery, I opted to stay awake and timed him, it took just under 7 minutes from first incision to last suture. It was a simple surgery, and I wish I had done it first thing instead of last, but that was the right way to go about it. Maybe you will be one of the lucky ones and not require surgery at all. It was the only time working as a nurse that I had Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year<APO>s all off in a row. Too bad I couldn<APO>t really use that hand, but oh well!!! Take care, Annette""The other post by Anon<UD>154313 explained it brilliantly. My only difference is that I did not feel a specific injury or time of the onset of pain, it just started gradually. I didn<APO>t even own a computer back then and did no repetitive movements of my left (non-dominant) hand. My doctor said it is more common with those kinds of activities, but possible with all of us. My insurance covered 90% of it, and because I am an RN, I got a professional discount for the rest of it. No anesthesia, just a local, so I had bills from the hospital for the out patient surgery clinic, and the doctor. I am not sure where you are, but I think Medicaid would pay for it once an orthopedic doctor said it was necessary. Didn<APO>t you see a regular doctor at the walk in clinic? Or did you see a nurse practitioner? Keep in touch. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know if this would help you or not, but some folks I have known over the years with foot problems that were neurological in nature used old soda pop bottles, one liter in size, filled about half full with plain water and frozen. They would put the bottles on the floor and use their stocking feet to roll them back and forth. This gave them a massage and cold treatment in one. It helped loosen up the joints and get them going. They did it again in the evening and some said they could even do it at work, under the desk. As always, when you find something on the internet, discuss it with your own doctor first to see if there are any reasons you should not do it at all. Take care, Annette""Sometimes people just assume that their remedies are all well known and people must have tried them before. The ice in a bottle trick is an old one, but who knows what people have heard of or tried. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Hi, Caprice She is a wonderful addition. I adore that book and have used it for years, over 10, I think. Will she be there regularly or is it a one time visit? Both of the experts there wrote great books that I had read prior to them becoming guest experts for the FMS community. Dr. Pellegrino<APO>s books are directed at folks with FMS, but Dr. Caudill<APO>s book is directed at any kind of chronic pain problem. I hope folks don<APO>t see it as just a FMS book, because it isn<APO>t one. We are lucky to have both of these doctors. Hugs, Annette""Unless you are typing with your bad hand held above your head, it will probably keep on hurting, no matter how many pain pills you take. The swelling causes pain, and not keeping it elevated above your heart causes more swelling. Take care, Annette""You need to have the splotches examined by your doctor. Tell him of any new symptoms also. This could be any of a number of things including circulatory, neurological, or autoimmune problems. Take care, Annette""Talk to your knee surgeon. He should discuss this all with you. Take care, Annette""Have you seen a therapist to treat your mood swings, anger, etc.? They do this without drugs, your doctor prescribes drugs. I like cognitive behavioural therapy myself. Did the issues go away when you stopped taking your meds to see how they affected things? If you need the oxycodone and are taking it per your prescription, and have not found anything yet in the literature you have researched, perhaps the answer is to go ahead and take it, but deal with your issues another way, so they stop being issues. It is not about being crazy, and certainly not about aging. I am much older than you and I am not facing those issues, nor are other older people I know. At 51, I would not worry about aging yet... How old where you when this started? Could it just be related to the chronic pain and medical issues you have? Discuss this with your doctor, he can also give you a referral to a therapist if you decide to try one. Take care, Annette""I would discuss this with your doctor, let him guide you as you tell him how you are feeling. It may just be a bad patch in your life, it is hard to impossible to tell from the info you have given us. The oxycodone in Percocet is also available without tylenol. I found it was also cheaper for my insurance company, so I changed over to avoid the donut hole in my Medicare Part D insurance. I took the tylenol as a part of Norco and Percocet as prescribed and the doctor checked my liver function tests regularly, as she did for well over 15 years, I had no ill effects from the tylenol. I was careful not to take any additional tylenol either by itself or in other products, you might start reading labels carefully if you don<APO>t already. I never got any kind of a high from any of my pain meds. I know the feeling you are describing though, I have had it after getting other IV drugs for migraines, it was a very vague feeling of unease and like you said, crabbiness. I have never heard of it in regards to opiates. I knew to expect it from the meds I was given, and had had other patients react that way when I gave it to them. I just waited it out, but I would hate to take anything that made me feel that way every day. I don<APO>t think you are having an opiate withdrawal syndrome because the oxycodone is stronger than the hydrocodone to begin with. You may be coming off the Soma though. It is a nasty drug, the sooner it is banned the better from my point of view. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know if that is causing your moods or not, discuss that with your doctor. I took Soma one time many years ago for back pain from working as a nurse. I fell asleep on the couch in the early evening and woke up a couple of hours later, and found myself unable to move at all. Literally, the house could have burned down around me. I could not move to get myself to bed or to a phone or anything, so I went back to sleep and when I woke up early in the AM, I managed to get myself to bed. That afternoon, I flushed the rest of the Soma down the toilet, and called my doctor, he prescribed a different muscle relaxant. He did not act particularly surprised, said it did that to some people. A few years ago, a group of doctors and pharmacists I was on a committee with felt that anyone who took Soma along with an opiate was looking to become an addict or already was an addict. They would not even see new patients who were already on that combination of drugs because the local opiate addicts preferred that combo. I don<APO>t think that is necessarily fair, but I do understand where they are coming from. I am glad the Zanaflex is working for you. I took that stuff about ten years ago and it worked well for me back then also. I only took it for a short time for an acute injury. Take care, Annette""I still do not know if the Soma is to blame or not. I would discuss this with your treating doctor. I am so glad you are feeling better. Take care, Annette""YOU are the only one who knows what your pain level is, no one else gets to tell you how you feel. Even husbands, lol. My grandad said if some one told me something I didn<APO>t like about myself, to examine the source first, but if several people told me the same thing, then I better look at how I present myself to others. And, perhaps work on changing it. I moved with my husband from Nevada to southern Oregon, then to northern Oregon so he could find work. My family is all in Calif, and New Mexico, I do okay, I use the phone and the computer to stay in touch. Only you know where you wish to live, think about all the positives and negatives, and you have to decide. I would stay where you are until your SSDI is approved, if you transfer your case while it is in motion you may get put at the end of the list in your new home. I stayed an extra 6 months in southern Oregon without my husband until my SSDI came through. Then I joined him in northern Oregon. There may be counseling opportunities even without insurance, I went to a therapist who was a graduate student, a senior doing her clinical rotation. They were on a sliding scale depending on your income, I paid nothing. If you are in a community with a university, there may be something like that for you. You have to call and ask around to find them. Take care, Annette""Xanax is a benzodiazepine, not a narcotic like the opiates. One should never come off of it without a doctor to supervise you, the seizures can be one of the dangers. Disability is tough, you need doctors to say you cannot do certain things that are required in the work place. It can take up to 2-3 years to get SSDI from Social Security. I would look for a low cost or free clinic in your area, try Google or whatever search engine you are used to. Check with the makers of your meds, they may have assistance programs that will help you get meds cheaply, or even free. Take care, Annette""You can learn to swallow pills if you can swallow solid food, I know because I used to chew even tiny little birth control pills. I would gag and cough and wretch when I tried to swallow them. A nurse friend of mine sat done and taught me to swallow pills when I had typhoid fever and had to take a lot of them. It only took one session. Or you can grind them up, or get them in liquid or skin patch types. All of those are more expensive to make than regular old pills. I use exercise, my hot tub, and meds to control my FMS pain. I take gabapentin, opiate pain pills, and zolpidem for sleep. That is all the RX drugs I use, all generic and cheap. Take care, Annette""She had me tilt my head forward after putting the pill on the very back part of my tongue, then drink a LOT of water through a straw. She said not to tilt my head back at all, to keep it in a neutral or tilted slightly forward position. She said that would keep the pill from hitting the back of my throat where the gag reflex is centered. I started with small pills, and worked my up, to handfuls of pills all at once. I taught my son and my nephew the same way when they were toddlers, they both managed fine also. My son still puts a pill way back on the back of his tongue, he is in his thirties now, lol. Please do not detox off the xanax without a doctor<APO>s supervision, you may not need to be in the hospital if you are tapered very slowly off of it, but that is up to you and your doctor. Take care, Annette""Best of luck with the pill swallowing, it just takes practice. Just think, if little kids can learn, so can you!! Looking forward to seeing you again. Take care, Annette""Is she depressed or in pain or what? Why is she crying? Does she go to a dialysis center or do it at home? My cousin switched over to a home unit, she likes it much better, although it was hard to learn at first. She needs to speak to her doctor, you can also write him a letter telling him what is going on. He cannot respond to you do to privacy laws, but at least he would have the information. Take care, Annette""You need to see your doctor about this. Many people get these kinds of headaches, often taking a migraine rescue med about an hour prior to intercourse will prevent the headache altogether. These meds require a RX from the doctor. You should see a doctor for any new or different kind of headache, to be certain you don<APO>t have anything seriously wrong with you. It can happen, but is rare. Take care, Annette""Has he tried Lidoderm patches? If the rash is completely healed and the skin is intact, they might help a lot. Take care, Annette""All I can suggest is for him to try more than one thing at a time. I find that getting a small amount of pain relief from each of several different treatments combines and gives me a fair amount of relief. He needs to have an honest discussion of his pain with his doctor, he needs to tell him just what activities he misses out on due to his pain. This will help his doctor understand where he is at right now. Take care, Annette PS, Post-herpetic neuralgia is very difficult to treat, there is a lot of trial and error involved.""To the folks with headaches, plus other types of chronic pain, I agree with Beth and Charles on the low rates of addiction, the last medical study I read about in a nursing journal said less than 1% of users became addicted. The article before that quoted about 5%, either percentage is very low. Be aware of addiction possibilities, but don<APO>t make medication decisions based on that alone. The one thing I would caution you about is using short acting opiates like Vicoprofen if you have a tendency towards migraines. They can trigger rebound headaches which can be very nasty. The only way to treat them is to stop the offending medication completely for weeks at a time until they go away. I would suggest keeping a headache journal and write down the times you get headaches, the times they go away, and the times you take each of your meds. This way the doctor should be able to figure out if the headaches are from the drugs or not. Once you know for sure, you can proceed. Take care, Annette""The journal I kept was very basic, once I figured out my triggers for the migraines. After that, I adjusted what I needed to lifestyle-wise and just put a star on the calendar day when I had a migraine, and wrote in the times I took my meds. If they did not help, I noted that in my journal, but it all fit in a Hall Mark type date book calendar. You cannot control the stress that comes to you, but you can control how you respond to that stress. Try reading about cognitive behavioural therapy. I still use many techniques that I learned years ago. As far as withdrawal goes, I doubt that was what was going on, you are on such low doses, but it is your body, not mine. I am with you about honesty being the best policy with your doctor. I read a poll just this weekend that said only 75% of patients were honest with their doctors about everything. Scary, how can the doctors do their jobs if we aren<APO>t completely honest with them? Let me know how you are doing. Take care, Annette""I take neurontin and it works great. However, I take it once a day a few hours before bedtime instead of the three times a day many people take it. My doctor says her chronic pain patients do well that way. It helps me sleep through the night better. The drunken side effects do go away with time, they did for me. They were also dose related. I went up to 1800 mg. a day, then back down to 800 mg. a day. It does take time to work, it is not like taking an opiate pain pill that works right away. My girl-friend used the rooster-comb injections, they are called Synvisc by the way. They helped her put off her knee replacement for about a year. She considered that worthwhile, other people don<APO>t. It is completely different from cortisone injections. I know from experience with friends and family that once you injure a knee, it is never the same again. It is a very complicated joint. I would see a very good ortho from a teaching hospital. Take care, Annette""Your doctor is doing exactly the right thing. All the literature says to start a new long acting med at half the ""equianalgesic"" dose, then adjust as necessary. Our bodies only develop a partial cross tolerance to pain meds, so if we took the whole dose right away, we could overdose and die. This is particularly true with methadone. We often develop respiratory depression that takes longer to develop tolerance to with this med, you don<APO>t want to stop breathing. It is very important to start the dose low, and increase it very slowly, in small increments. This may mean you will have to wait a few days/weeks to have perfect pain relief, but you can do that. I have been on methadone for over a year now, and I am very happy with it. I only increased my dose one time every 5-7 days. I worked with this drug years ago and am very familiar with how it affects the body. I won<APO>t do the math for your doctor, but it sounds to me like he is on the right path. Take care, Annette""Hi, Bet Suboxone contains naloxone. Subutex and Buprenex do not. There are also generics in the injectable form (no Naloxone) at least. Once a drug is approved by the FDA doctors can often prescribe it however they like, thus off label prescribing. I think some doctors use the oral type for pain management, even though it was originally made for opiate addiction treatment. I am an old, cynical nurse, and I suspect that they developed it for heroin addiction more to get the patent on it than because methadone didn<APO>t work. I don<APO>t think that it is any substitute drug that fixes an addiction, it is the work on themselves that the patients puts in while on that substitute drug so they don<APO>t have to worry about withdrawals and scoring more drugs. There may be minor differences, but both are habit forming, cause withdrawal syndromes, and basically just put off withdrawal until later. Then it can be tapered slowly to avoid major problems. From reading message boards both groups have some drug cravings regardless. Do you remember Talwin NX? They took Talwin and added Naloxone to it the same way for the same reason. Talwin was a popular drug of abuse back when it was more often prescribed for pain. They added the Naloxone so it could not be crushed and injected. I thought the new Oxycontin OP was going to be made that way, but it wasn<APO>t. I suspect they will come out with an Oxycontin with Naloxone in it just before they lose their patent rights on the Oxycontin OP. Shame on me for being so cynical!! Hugs, Annette""If you have some sort of a serious adverse effect from a drug, call the company that made it and complain to them. Of course, let your prescribing doctor know too. If you read about it a drug being recalled, call your pharmacist or the company that made it and ask what lots were affected, the pharmacy that fills your RXs should have records that tell them if you need to be concerned or not. Remember that a lot of drugs are recalled for other than serious reasons, so no need to panic. Take care, Annette""Take the meds as prescribed, and tell your doctor<APO>s receptionist that you would like to see the doctor ASAP due to pain from your recent surgery. Ask to be put on their cancellation list if necessary. But, most doctors keep a few slots open for emergencies. Be a bit of a bully, speak up for yourself when you insist on an earlier appt. They don<APO>t know how bad your pain is, because they are not experiencing it. Take care, Annette""Same here. Take care, Annette""First of all, since this is not your first experience with orthopedic surgery, you apparently knew this doctor only saw patients in your facility once a week. I personally would find this unacceptable. I do get over surgery pretty easily so far, but I also know things can happen, I want my doctor, or some doctor to be available if there is a post op problem.If you had a post op infection would your doctor want you to wait until the end of April to deal with it at a scheduled appt., I think not. I am a nurse, and everywhere I have worked we told patients to take their pain meds an hour prior to any activity, including PT, we told them this because that is what their doctors wanted them to do. PT folk agreed with that. Oral pain meds do not work well enough to keep you from feeling what is going on in your own limbs. You still know what part of your body hurts and usually you know what makes it better and worse. Your PT should listen to what you tell him/her about your pain and believe you. Take care, Annette""All I can suggest is that you don<APO>t ask for pain meds at all. Ask for pain relief, and functional improvement. Let the doctor know what you are already doing to improve yourself, and tell him what things you are unable to do that you would like to do and ask him how to get to that place. Be willing to try anything and give it an honest length of time to work. Take care, Annette""I totally agree, lying to your doctor about anything is just plain counterproductive if you want your health to improve. Trust goes both ways. Another problem with lying about side effects to a particular drug is that some doctors will not only stop prescribing that drug to you, but may also not give you other drugs (somewhat related to the first drug) that you may really need some day. Take care, Annette""Medically speaking you have an anterior (front) and posterior (back) thorax (chest) area. To me if someone complained of chest pain, I would ask them where it hurts, and then decide how to write it down so that the next person who reads that chart can picture where the pain is. If someone described pain in the back of the chest when he took a deep breath or coughed, that tells me that the lungs or the outer sack that contains them, or the ribs themselves may be affected. The mechanism of injury would suggest the chest wall as a starting point. If someone described pain in their posterior spinal area, I would look at the spine and surrounding musculature. Remember that your chest goes from the nipples in the front all the way to the back of the spine and the skin, bones, and all the organs inside could be involved. That said, only a doctor who can actually examine the patient and ask questions could make a diagnosis and suggest treatment. Take care, Annette""I am sorry to be the bearer of sad news, but I would personally not undergo any invasive procedure for pain management that only offered a 40% chance of success. I would also ask the doctor exactly what his definition of ""success"" was. Often pain management doctors consider a procedure ""successful"" if only 50% of the pain is relieved. If that is his definition then only 4 out of 10 patients get at least half of their pain relieved with this procedure for this ailment. I was not aware that they were doing epidurals for IC. I have Irritable Bladder Syndrome, so I have done some research for my own problems. I would ask this doctor how many epidurals he has done for this type of pain, specifically related to IC. My general opinion is that I would like a doctor to have perfomed 100 of the procedures he is suggesting for me. That is the learning curve for doctors doing invasive procedures in my opinion. There are lots of other types of overactive bladder medicine besides Toviaz. I took Levbid, and Urispas. I remember the Urispas worked better. If the pain lasts a long time and you are taking pain meds like trmadol, the doctor could increase the dose or offer you a long acting version, or you could try opiates for pain. The problems I had with my bladder caused symptoms of a bladder infection: frequency, irritation, and intermittent pain. Nothing that I required opiate pain meds for. When I started neurontin for my FMS, my Irritable Bladder Syndrome and IBS seemed to improve too. Not sure why. I also eliminated caffeine from my diet and that made a huge difference for me. I had read about that one myself, no one suggested it to me. Talk this all over with your pain management doctor and your urologist, then do your research and decide for yourself what to do next. Take care, Annette""Everyone has to decide this for themselves, lol. I just would hope that the patient and the doctor are using the same language to define successful treatment. I love neurontin, it has helped so many related symptoms of my FMS: irritable bladder, irritable bowel, and migraines too. All are somewhat neuro related. I think it is a great drug for me, but it doesn<APO>t work out that well for everyone. I love you too, Beth, lol. Take care, Annette""I have FMS also, in addition to a couple of other chronic pain conditions. I decided many years ago that this IS normal for me. I doubt that I will ever not hurt. It amazed me how much better I felt once I stopped chasing my tail and wishing to be pain free. I found a decent doctor, got on the medications I needed and started doing what I knew I should do for myself. Life does get better, just give it a little time. Take care, Annette""Hi, Bet I just looked it up in my drug handbook, and it said those were the formulas and doses available. Back when I worked as a nurse in a methadone clinic in the 1970s we got our ""experimental"" methadone and it arrived at our clinic everyday in liquid form, our patients were not told their dose. We mixed it in Kool-Ade. It was also used in a liquid drug cocktail for terminal patients, mixed with cocaine and other drugs. It allegedly treated their pain and allowed them to be awake and alert at the same time. I gave it a few times as a nursing student in 1968-70. I currently take a 5 mg. tablet of methadone for pain three times a day. It is scored so it can be broken in half, as can the ten mg. tablets. I don<APO>t know if the dissolvable tablets are prescribed for pain or not. I can see where they might be just used in clinics that treat addiction as the doses there are so much higher than what are commonly used for pain. It is cold and wet here in Oregon as usual, lol. Where is Spring???? Hugs, Annnette""This is true as long as you are established with a single pharmacy. But they still only tell what you have gotten there, not what you got elsewhere. I would appreciate having a national database for controlled substances as long as it is only used for certain purposes. I would hate for that to be public information. Hugs, Annette""I am pretty sure if you really want your old records you can get them, perhaps not the same day, but in time. The rules usually say the doctor has to maintain your records somewhere for a certain length of time, usually years. Request them in writing, including your full name and birth date.You may be charged a copying fee in some areas. Methadone comes in 5, and 10 mg. oral tablets, and 40 mg. dissolving tablets that I am aware of. Assuming you are getting 10 mg. tablets, you are on a pretty high daily dose. Your doctor may be uncomfortable prescribing that much. Are you asking for 14 a day, or going up to 10 a day from the 8 he is now prescribing you? Just talk to him and ask him why he is prescribing the drug the way he is. He may have good reasons. I know I discussed the long term side effects of methadone with my pain management doc (my pcp prescribes it). I had read about cardiac toxicity and altered ECGs. He reassured me that it was only with higher doses than mine that those problems occurred. He suggested one ECG now and then one a year while I was taking methadone. Perhaps your doctor feels the cardiac risk is too high on your present dose, who knows what he thinks? You have to ask him, and really listen to his answers, take notes. Take care, Annette""No one here is qualified to give you any kind of comparison or diagnosis. You need to take the films from all of these tests to a neurologist who can do a physical exam, a medical history, and then take a look at the imaging tests. After that he can give you his opinion of what is going on in your spine and make suggestions as to what you can try as to treatment. Once you get a diagnosis and treatment plan, bring it back and others with similar experiences can offer suggestions as to what helped them. Take care, Annette""How many grand mal seizures have you had? Perhaps the doctor should put you on a seizure preventative first, then slowly decrease the xanax???? I detoxed from another benzo, Klonopin, years ago, and it was lousy, but it was over with in a few weeks with my doctor<APO>s help. I have also only read about rapid detox in terms of opiates, but I suppose it would also be possible with benzos. I also have heard that for opiate rapid detox it costs about $10,000, and insurance generally does not cover it. I suspect the costs would be similar. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""PS, I also have read and heard on TV that you should only have this done in a hospital setting, not in an outpatient clinic or doctor<APO>s office. Safety issues were cited. Take care, Annette""I agree with Swank, just speak to the pharmacist about it, perhaps their computer is set wrong. Of course they should correctly identify the manufacturer on the bottle, if only so you would know if your pills are involved in a recall of some kind. I suspect there are already rules in place about that. That said, I am sorry, but I am of the mind set that generics are just fine. I have taken many different generic brands of meds I have been on for years, and never noticed any difference at all. The pharmacist at my pharmacy always talks to the customer when they change where they get the pills from, probably to stop all the calls they get when the customer calls and says his pills are a different color or shape, so I do know I have taken different pills that have the same drugs in them. Everyone has different opinions about generics. I feel if you want drugs of a certain brand, ask for them, be willing to pay for them, and you will get them. You can also call your pharmacist and tell him that your pressure went up since you were taking the new generic brand of Cozaar, see what he says. I have found that my pharmacists have been great members of my health care team. Take care, Annette""You call the 1-800 information line and ask for the consumer line to whatever company it is you wish to speak to. They have always given me an 800 number to call. Once I get through to that, I just tell the person who answers the phone what my concerns are and they transfer my call to the appropriate person. Take care, Annette""I am sorry that you feel badly about the way people have responded to you here. I went back and read all the posts, and I did not take any of them as you ""being attacked"". I did not even consider them to be disrespectful. Some of us disagreed with your take on things. A disagreement is not an attack. No one said using opiates for other than pain was a ""terrible thing"" or a ""big sin"". I know I just suggested you look at other options of what may have helped you in the past in addition to the opiates. Even those of us who may not have agreed with you about generics still told you how to go about getting them in your store. One other thing, I cannot count on my fingers how many pain drugs came out and the public was told they would not cause abuse, tolerance, withdrawals, or dependence, and were later recalled or it turned out they did cause one or all of those things. I don<APO>t believe in wonder drugs for pain anymore, I don<APO>t believe the hype that drug companies give us. I will always wait until a drug is widely prescribed for 5-6 years, and then see what the side effects really are. This may be a great drug for you, but it may not be for me. Same thing for drugs that work for me, they may not work for you. That is why I always tell people to discuss their drug needs with their own doctors after they have done their research. Best of luck to you, I hope you stay on here, even if you discount my opinions. That is how we have good, open discussions. Take care, Annette""To me, it makes more sense for you to be responsible for making yourself have that ""I<APO>m okay"" feeling. It took awhile for me to learn how to do that using cognitive behavoural therapy techniques, but I did it. A pain med is not the way to find that place within yourself. It is only to treat your pain. It is just my personal opinion, but I feel like you are putting way too much emphasis on pain meds, brands, makers, etc. I think you probably had that ""I<APO>m okay"" feeling for other reasons, but not due to the medication at all some years ago. It just happened that you were on that and you have connected it in your own mind. Look back, and discount the medication, and try to see what else was going on back then that made you feel good about life in general. Because you have all these personal reasons for continuing to use the same pharmacy, and particular makers of meds, etc., I doubt I will come up with anything that might help you. I wish it were different. Take care, Annette""I also got that shadow of a feeling about the ""I<APO>m okay"" perspective of his regarding the medicine he preferred. I think we often tend to read between the lines, it is so hard to communicate fully on paper and not be able to see the person<APO>s face and body language. Hugs, Annette""I have used a TENS unit for a different kind of pain and it helped some, it was worth using anyway. My husband had AVN in his hip and when it was finally diagnosed, he would not tell the doctor how much it really hurt, his femur head was completely crushed. He was like that for two years while he dealt with other health issues, then he had a THR, his pain was almost immediately gone, and he got off of the methadone he was taking within weeks. In my experience with labs the uric acid level is not enough higher than normal to worry about. The sed rate and the C-Reactive protein mean that you have inflammation somewhere in your body. They go up and down depending on how your body is doing, something as minor as a toothache can throw them off. You will have to discuss this with your doctor when she is available. You and she can figure out WHY they are high. Same with the ANA. It is a screening tool for certain problems, but is not diagnostic of anything on its own. I have had an elevated ANA my entire adult life, doesn<APO>t mean anything, I am just one of those people who has a false positive. Again you have to discuss all of these things with your doctor. She needs to put them up with your physical picture and your history to figure out what is going on. As far as her current availability goes, you have to decide for yourself if it works out. I adore my doctor, she has changed practices once since she became my PCP, and I just recently got a letter saying she is changing again. They take my insurance, so hopefully it won<APO>t be a big deal. I have already followed her from just around the corner to 35 miles away. I am willing because I like her enough, I will see how the change of clinics go, the support staff makes a big difference sometimes. Is there some reason I don<APO>t understand that you didn<APO>t ask for an appt. today? I would also ask to be put on her cancellation list so if anyone else cancels their appt. you might get it. Let the doctor know that this makes it very difficult for you, talk to her in person about this. Ask if there is some way that she could keep one appt. per day open for urgent visits. My doctor keeps her schedule that way, and my husband<APO>s doctor also does and if you call his office at 7 am, it is first come, first served for any openings. I have always been able to get him an appt. for the same day by setting our alarm clock for 6:45 AM. Both are very popular doctors with busy practices. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""It is great that he decided he didn<APO>t need them anymore. That said, he needs to share all this with his prescribing doctor and ask for advice. Opiate withdrawal for otherwise healthy adults is not a life threatening event, but since he has severe RA and is on other meds, he should discuss this all with his doctor. Take care, Annette""Please do not get angry with the rheumy about this incident if he has been fine up until now. Withdrawal treatment is rather specialized and he might not have known what to do in the face of withdrawals. Rheumies ONLY deal with the RA part of your son<APO>s health issues. You are being a good mom taking him in during these tough economic times, and seeing that he gets good medical care. Try using your search engine to look for free or low cost health clinics in your area, it might help you find a primary care doctor or urgent care clinic for your son. He may need other medical care unrelated to the RA anyway. Knowing where these places might be may avoid the cost of going to the ER in the future. Take care, Annette""I had one in a trigger point in the back of my upper arm once and it made the pain go away for months and months. I had no side effects at all. The steroid was mixed with a long acting local anesthetic. Take care, Annette""I would go see a GI doctor, a gastroenterologist, andlet him know what is going on. Some folks retain a stone in the duct after having their gall bladder out, that can cause pain that feels remarkably similar to the original gall bladder pain. They have tests to see if that is the problem. The other option is to go see your pcp and explain it all to him if this feels really different from the gall bladder pain you had prior to surgery. It may be unrelated to the gall bladder problem. Happy quilting, I used to do a lot of it, but stopped when my cervical spine became a big issue for me. Hurt too much, then my hands would go numb. It is a great hobby though. Take care, Annette""Please see a doctor. Having edema is not normal even if you do sit for long periods each day. Are you taking any medicine for your type II diabetes? Are you currently seeing a doctor regarding this? It may go away if you lose weight, or change your diet, but it may not. If your blood sugar is still high even though you have quit the Coke, you may need medications for that or suffer the complications that diabetes can bring. You are so lucky to have been able to travel so much, but it is hard on medical care for chronic problems. Please find yourself a good primary care doctor, family doctor, or GP in the UK perhaps. GP stands for general practitioner, I think they do a lot of primary care over there. My mom<APO>s side of the family was from Ireland, it should be nicer in the summer, she and her brother and my cousin went there on vacation as did my brother. My dad<APO>s family was from Norway, they never even wanted to go visit, too cold. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Are you short of breath at all? If you are, go to the ER right away, if not, see a doctor, but you can probably find a cheaper way to do that. Take care, Annette""Flector patches are NSAID medication in a skin patch. Ibuprofen is also an NSAID. You might call your pharmacist and ask if it is okay to take both of these together, if that was not specifically mentioned by the doctor who gave you the patches. It sounds like things are improving slightly. Take care, Annette""Please go see your doctor. Meanwhile it is important that you take 5-6 deep breaths and cough several times every hour. If you hold a pillow over the area that hurts and squeeze fairly tight to splint the painful area, it may not hurt so much. Again, go see a doctor. Take care, Annette""It would depend on what it is showed you used, and if a new doctor listens to your reasoning or not. Take care, Annette""You didn<APO>t say where your pain was? If it is vaginal pain, and it does not hurt during intercourse, perhaps you are not using the tampon correctly, or it is the wrong size. During intercourse, you are probably more lubricated, is that the issue? If this pain is anything but very localized in your vagina, you need to see a doctor right away. You might have a serious infection. I don<APO>t know if you mean your stomach or in your belly/abdomen. If it is in your stomach that is much higher up, right under your sternum. If you are having pain in your belly/abdomen, see a doctor as soon as you can. Use your search engine to look for free or low cost clinics in your area. There are a lot of them around, but they don<APO>t advertise. Take care, Annette""Vicodin will test as a positive for opiates on some tests, it is a semisynthetic opiate. Is this a drug that they are giving you, or did you get it from some other doctor? Don<APO>t know about the marijuana though. Didn<APO>t the doctor do a blood test for a followup to the positive urine test? Or was the original test from blood? Take care, Annette""Although more can certainly be learned about addiction, I feel we have come a long way in various treatment options. I worked in a heroin addiction treatment center in the 1970s, and we have come a long way since then in learning about addiction and various treatment methods. Cognitive Behavoural Therapy is one that seems to work fairly well for addiction. I am personally far more afraid of addiction than I am of chronic pain management. A very low percentage of addicts recover for the rest of their life. I have managed my pain for 15 years and it does not scare me anymore. We choose to stigmatize addicts, we can choose not to. Addiction is just another chronic illness, with possible severe complications. We at this board often ""scold"" (for lack of a better word) folks who come here with addiction problems, we could be much more compassionate towards them. We may not be able to help them much, but we could be much nicer to them. Think about it. Thank you for this discussion topic. Take care, Annette""I personally do not care at all. I follow my doctor<APO>s instructions to the letter. Those of us who do should not have any problem. Years ago many ERs had lists of patients seen there and in other ERs and freely traded info back and forth about patients who showed up asking for pain meds. I recall one patient who had been seen in 8 different ERs in 24 hours, something of a record in that area. It was halted due to confidentiality concerns. Everyone tore up their lists, or books. No more phone calls to other ERs to check on people. I feel that was a good thing. This is just a larger database. Some states already have one and have had it for years. Other states do not maintain a database. I think it is good to get everyone on the same page about this. Most ER doctors do not have time to look everyone up before they even see them as you suggested. I don<APO>t recall right now what the limits will be as far as who can access it and for what reasons. When I read the legislation, it did not particularly concern me. I guess we will see how it all works out. I don<APO>t think it included ALL medications, just controlled substances. It also does not tell you how the person is actually taking the meds, only how many they got and when they got them. Few people bring their bottles to the ER, although that makes life much easier for the nurses. Far better than the old, ""I take a little blue pill 2-3 times a day, I don<APO>t remember what it is for or how the doctor originally said to use it. Take care, Annette""There are cardiac side effects with higher doses of methadone, people die from arrythmias due to high doses of methadone according to the articles I have read and also per my PM doc that I have seen twice for consultations. I agree with Beth, ask your PM doc why he prescribes the way he does, he may indeed have your long term health in mind. My husband uses methadone for his chronic pain now, he switched from oxycodone. I also use it but we have different doctors. My doc uses it with a BT med in my case. I take a very small dose three times a day. My hubby takes a larger dose twice a day and no BT meds. We are both happy with our pain control. It just goes to show there is no ""one size fits all"" in pain management, we all respond to different things in different ways. He and I both use the hot tub, exercise, massage, and other treatment techniques in addition to our meds, both opioids and adjuvant meds. I would try as many different kinds of treatments as possible to fill in for any increase in pain from the change in the methadone dose. Take care, Annette""I would comment on a couple of things right off the bat. If your doctor has prescribed three pills per day as a maximum, you should not be taking five, it is a trust issue with a fairly new doctor. You should also not be doing any kind of construction work, it clearly is not good for your pain control. Being on short term disability is about making time to get your health care needs met as much as possible without worrying about the money abruptly stopping all together. It is not the same as a paid vacation where you get all the household chores caught up. Call the doctor<APO>s office make an appt. to see him and tell him face to face that the meds are not working to control your pain 24/7. Let him know that if he can<APO>t do it, you would like him to refer you to someone who feels more qualified. Explain that there are certain things, list them, that you would like to be able to do that you cannot do now because the pain overtakes you. Doctors like to see concrete goals that you might be able to meet and move on with your life. Be willing to try other options should he suggest them. Increasing the dose of hydrocodone will not increase the amount of time that it works, that is part of that drug, it only lasts 4-6 hours. It might well increase the amount of relief that you get during that 4-6 hours. That is a good thing. Just a comment regarding that drug. I think seeing the neurologist and the neuropsychologist is a good thing. The FMS diagnosis seems to be a tentative thing since you don<APO>t have the usual pain on palpation of the tender points, perhaps you have something else altogether??? I have seen both those kinds of doctors and found them both to be very useful. They will also be useful in your claim for SSDI if you need some long term disability. Like Bet said, you may win out in the long run, even though you are in pain right now. Have you approached this PM doctor for increased hydrocodone on a short term basis? Perhaps suggest a couple of months to see how the other pain management treatments he tries on you work out? Or ask for some kind of long acting opiate instead? I wouldn<APO>t name brands or anything, but you could tell him someone else mentioned it to you as a suggestion for an alternative. (Me.) Take care, Annette""The ED is not required by the Joint Commission to give you opiates for pain, they are only required to assess and treat your pain at that moment. They can give you an injection that may only last a few hours, or they might just tell you to use a heating pad, or do back exercises and see your own doctor in the AM or in the next week or whatever. One person cannot have anyone<APO>s accreditation revoked for not treating their acute pain properly. The requirement that the hospital ""treat"" pain is purposefully left pretty vague so the doctors are free to do their jobs as they see fit. I would not put the ED that might save my life, in a fight with a doctor over his lack of control over my pain. Other than that, I agree with you, call the doctor in the middle of the night if you feel that is what will get this doctor off his behind. But keep in mind that if you just make him angry, it might not serve you best in the long run. Think the whole thing through and do whatever you can do to advocate for yourself while being polite and respectful. I like my doctor to walk into the exam room and see me, and be glad to see me. Take care, Annette""It is great that your doctor made time to see you. That is the sign of a good doctor. I think those of us with good doctors should be very happy to have them. I know I am. Take care, Annette""A good thought too. I know if I got opiates from other than my usual internist without telling her, she could drop me from her practice. It is in my opiate consent form. That is what the new database is all about, making sure that patients are not getting pills from more than one doctor without telling them each what the other is prescribing. Hugs, Annette""The starting dose is not about matching the oxycontin dose. It is just a place to start, then you adjust the methadone as the doctor tells you to until you have good pain control. I also switched because it was so much cheaper, I use Medicare Part D and did not want to end up in the donut hole part way through the year. I switched from a generic MS Contin that I had been using for about 12 years. No regrets on my part. I get excellent pain control and it is very cheap. You should not need so much methadone as six 10 mg. tablets per day. Most people only use it 2-3 times a day and get good relief. It is naturally long acting and does build up in your system over time. For this reason it is very important that you start out with a fairly low dose and move up very slowly about once every 5-7 days. Many people find that after a few weeks of having their pain under control, they may even be able to lower their dose and still maintain good pain control. NEVER take an extra methadone tablet, like some folks do with other opiates. It can be very dangerous with methadone and one won<APO>t usually get the extra pain relief they were seeking from a single extra dose. It is not for break through pain. Respiratory depression with methadone takes longer for the body to come to tolerate, and extra doses can cause death by one simply not breathing any more. A medic alert bracelet or some way of letting emergency medical folk know you are on this drug is very important. I have been on it for about 18 months now and I am very happy with it. Take care, Annette""Hi, Magsjeanea I really appreciate the invitation, but I would prefer to converse on this board rather than start a separate email relationship. I find it easier to consolidate things to one place. I have had a couple of bad outcomes when I exchanged email addresses in the past with folks I didn<APO>t know well, or only knew from here. One was suicidal and kept sending me horrid letters about killing herself, and the other sent me really dumb, half-naked photos of himself, unsolicited of course. Nothing I could do about either one except ignore them until they went away. I doubt you would do anything like that, but by posting here we have at least one built in security function with the moderators here. Be very careful posting your own email address, I hope it is not your own personal email account, but rather one you can dispose of easily if things do not turn out the way you wish. I am so glad to see you post here, I hope you don<APO>t stop or get too busy with other things, your input is very useful. Take care, Annette""I am so glad you made such a great friend on line. My son met his wife on line, I am truly blessed to have her in my life. I am just a bit squeamish about the whole thing right now. Perhaps in the future. Meanwhile, I hope to keep seeing you here. Take care, Annette""Good, I was afraid you all would go off and leave us here, lol. Maybe someday, I will join you in cyberspace. My DIL is the same, I could not have hand picked a better one. Take care, Annette""I always have someone near me when I try the first dose of any medicine. That way if I have some strange or severe reaction, they can do what needs to be done. Take care, Annette""Go see a doctor and find out what is wrong with you. Only a doctor that you see in person, can examine you and also take a history and get to the bottom of your problem. Take care, Annette""Like the other poster said there is no law that says a doctor must prescribe controlled substances to anyone. What exactly are you saying? Take care, Annette""Interesting, I did not think of it that way, but that could be the real question. I have never had a doctor do a pill check, nor is it in my pain contract. If it is in your contract with the doctor, that is an agreement with him, not a legally binding contract from what I have read. However, Mag is right, if you break the contract by not providing the pills to count, the doctor is under no obligation to continue treating you. Take care, Annette""If not a real safe, get at least a locked tackle box for your meds. This protects them from thieving visitors who might feel a bit bold by walking past you with a tackle box in hand. It will also keep small children and teenagers from dipping their hands in your pill bottles. Don<APO>t hide it in your bathroom, put it somewhere inconspicuous in your bedroom closet, or somewhere else no one should be going without your presence. Having been an ER nurse, please put ALL your drugs in there, not just the ""stronger"" ones. Even plain, over the counter tylenol will kill. Thank you for the opportunity to give my yearly rant on this topic, lol. Take care, Annette""You can get a small metal box that will take a padlock at most hardware stores or sporting goods stores. Meanwhile when you leave the house, lock the bedroom door and be sure to lock any windows in the bedroom also. If your teenager is showing interest it would be easy for him to have a friend go get the pills while you are all out. Teenagers are ignorant when it comes to thinking ahead about consequences. They also do not think their friends would do their family any harm, wrong. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t believe anyone should ever take their meds in front of small children. They often look like candy or TicTacs, kids don<APO>t get it regardless of their mental challenges. I think good parenting classes are a great idea these days. They are available in most communities. Too often we no longer live near parents or other older family members and don<APO>t always have access to good parenting advice. Things have also become more complicated since I was a youngster. Do you have a good support system for yourself as the parent of an autistic child? Take care, Annette""Keep looking for other mom<APO>s to hang out with, you will find someone who is more understanding of your son<APO>s challenges. You can<APO>t expect people to know what to do with him, just tell them or show them. All kids have differences. Is your husband available to go to classes and share info with you when Kaiser has them? Maybe his schedule is better. Take care, Annette""Don<APO>t worry you will deal with whatever comes your way. There are lousy parents of ""normal"" kids, it sounds like you just ran into one of those. My son had learning disabilities, and my nephew has orthopedic birth defects that required many surgeries. All kids have something going on. Take care, Annette""Who asked you if you needed anything else? Who asked the doctor<APO>s nurse about your pain meds? I find it hard to believe that the doctor refused to give you any reason at all, if you asked him directly about the two meds. Did you ask him face to face at that appt.? Taking more tylenol that is recommended will not give one more pain relief, so there is not much point in overdoing it. If it doesn<APO>t work, it doesn<APO>t work. Take care, Annette""If they gave you your meds earlier than they should have, but you have been taking them the way you are supposed to, you shouldn<APO>t be out of meds. They should have just offered you an appt. for later on when they are actually due to be refilled. Just offer to bring in your meds for a pill count, and they should be able to fix this mess for you. If, however, you took the extra pills, and used them as you thought best, you might be out of luck. Take care, Annette""I also have FMS, and restless leg syndrome (and other things). I found I had a very positive response to stopping caffeine as far as bladder urgency was concerned, but did not find it worked well for the pain itself. Losing weight has been shown NOT to be very useful in controlling FMS symptoms. I have lost about 50 pounds in the last couple of years and although I feel better generally, I do not have less pain because of it. The part of your post that I noticed was that he ""wants to"" take you off of your pain meds, not that he has already. Are you worrying before you even need to? If your pain is not well controlled without meds, has he told you he will take you off of them anyway? What else besides pain meds do you do for your pain? I take non-opiate meds, and use other methods including belly dancing to the TV and DVDs, a hot tub, etc. Print out your post and read it to him if that is what it takes for you to talk to him. Or write down your biggest fear, and your questions for him. Take a pad and pen with you and write down the answers he gives you. Or have a friend or family member with your to do that. Take care, Annette""I feel it is impossible to split up the emotional issues from the pain issues. I think the best thing to do is to first treat the pain and get it under control, then see how much more you need to do. Try reading ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"" by Dr. Margaret A. Caudill, MD, PhD. I found it very useful. It sounds like a bit of family therapy might help you work things out so that living with your mother-in-law is not ""compounding"" the problem. Having an older generation live with a family can be a really good thing for your child and for the rest of the family. But, it takes a lot of compromise on both sides, and boundary setting too. Take care, Annette""Okay, I understand about cultural differences, my great-granddad from the Old Country, went upstairs and never came down again after emigrating to the US, and being unable to find work in his chosen profession. Nowadays, he would have been given antidepressants and therapy, it would have saved a lot of grief for everyone. My grandad had a fit when his own sister, an RN, put their brother in the hospital and their sister-in-law in a mental hospital in their old age due to many chronic conditions, including chronic schizophrenia (she had had a total psychotic break) in the sister-in-law. They had had cultural differences that had kept them out of the medical/mental health system for far too long. Even in their late 70s, it did help them both. I was a young adult and I remember. My great-auntie was why I became a nurse. You are a university professor, no excuses for cultural differences, if you live in the US anyway. YOU can go to therapy and find out the best way for you to deal with your mother-in-law and her ways. Be the first in your family to go to therapy, someone has to be? For your child<APO>s sake, that is worth it, no? Who knows what will or won<APO>t happen with your mother-in-law, it is not written yet. If you are the ""man"" of the house, she might do it if you tell her to. I am a feminist, you have no idea how hard that was to write... The men in my father<APO>s parents household had far more to say about who did what than the women did, they pretty much did what they were told by the men. Thank God, Mom and Dad were past all that silliness. A good friend of my brother<APO>s, a young man with schizophrenia was from Jordan, with Old Country parents, they all lived together in the US. They never heard of schizophrenia before, the mother made her son go onto a mental hospital, and then learned all about it through family therapy. It worked out well for them all. The father came around eventually too. Meanwhile, you can teach your child about superstitions and old time beliefs, my folks taught me not to believe all the same things my grandparents did. Back to your pain now, it sounds as if your pain may not be adequately treated for a number of reasons. Addiction effects such a low percentage of users of opiate medications that addiction alone should not deter you from using it, unless you have been a drug abuser in the past. Discuss this with your doctor. I have used opiates daily for about 15 years now, always exactly as my doctor prescribes them for my chronic pain, no signs of addiction here. Opiates and even your Lidoderm patches for pain will not work as well if you use them when your pain becomes nearly intolerable or downright unbearable as they will if you use them at the onset of the pain becoming more than a little uncomfortable. I am a nurse, I know better, and I still used them wrong at the beginning, like you do. A nurse friend of mine told me when I stopped working that she hoped that now I would take my meds the way I told my patients to use them. Ouch, that hurt! I realized then that I did not follow my own instructions. I changed how I used them and got much better relief. Medical studies have shown for many years that you will use less opiates over time and they will work better if you take them earlier on rather than waiting until the pain is terrible. Medical studies also show in a recent issue of my nursing journal that addiction only happens in about 1% of users of opiates as directed by their doctors for pain. So, don<APO>t believe me, believe the experts. To be continued...""Enjoy the book, you might also read ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns, MD. It is an excellent read about cognitive behavioural therapy. I chose to use a few of the techniques that I thought were applicable to me, but using the whole program might be better. I did read the whole book. I remembered it vaguely, so I must have read it when it was first printed. Maybe until you decide if therapy would be useful for you, this would suffice. Discuss this all with your doctor, he has many resources that may help you. Sorry, the reply was too long to post all in one entry. Take care, Annette""I have used Lidoderm Patches that contain lidocaine for pain. I cut them in pieces and apply them wherever I have pain. I am allowed 2 patches every 24 hours, 12 hours on and 12 hours off. The relief continues for awhile after I take the patch off. I don<APO>t know if this is what you are talking about or not. Take care, Annette""Hi, Roe I seem to remember that Jayne<APO>s previous posts included comments that she presently only used opiates after surgery, so her surgeon who did this surgery may be under the impression that she is treating post op pain only, not chronic pain. Jayne has had a lot of surgeries scheduled lately. Not everyone gets GI symptoms from NSAIDs, I took ibuprofen for over two years at 800 mg. 3-4 times a day without any problem. My doctor was aware of course, and monitored me properly. I am back on it at half the dose now, not sure for how long, we will see. Nowadays, doctors often prescribe preventative meds along with NSAIDs to prevent GI problems if someone will be on NSAIDs for a long time. I agree with you on the tramadol, I found it to be very helpful for many years. I had neither side effects or withdrawal symptoms from it. Lucky me, but there are others out there who are lucky too. Take care, Annette""My apology to Jayne. I reread this post and she says she discussed this with her new primary care doctor, not her surgeon. My bad. A pcp should know better about treating chronic pain. The old RX for percocet may have been from her surgeon, I admit I am confused. Take care, Annette""My doctor gave me samples to try, so I did not have to put out any $$ until I knew if they would work. I think they cost about $285 for a box of 30 patches if you have to pay cash. Perhaps generics are available now. Take care, Annette""Why are you afraid to just tell the doctor the truth? You have burn marks on your skin where the patches have harmed the skin to back up your story, she should look at them anyway, just to make sure they are healing properly. The main thing I disagree with you about is leaving phone messages for your doctor regarding chronic problems like pain. I recommend you make an appt. and go and see her face to face, and explain what is going on. You will see her on Wed. so just tell her what is going on, you would not react this way for blood pressure meds that were not working, this is not any different. I would also suggest you see a therapist and maybe try some cognitive behavioural therapy regarding your response to this stress in your life. You may not be able to control the stresses in your life, but you can learn to control your reaction to them. You don<APO>t have to be crying all the time, that only makes your pain worse anyway, besides driving your family away. Take care, Annette""Tell your doctor and see if adjusting the dose slowly downwards helps any. This was a common complaint among methadone users when I worked at a clinic many years ago. Often they said they were better if we lowered their dose a bit. I also use methadone for pain, but I take a far lower dose than you do, and have not encountered that side effect. I rarely sleep longer than 5-6 hours even with a sleeping pill. Take care, Annette""Hi, Dr A. One small comment, occupational therapists are the ones who evaluate your work station, and make suggestions about it, your computer station, and tool bag. They also evaluate home situations as far as how to cook, clean, etc. without hurting yourself. Some years ago when I worked home health as an RN, the PT and OT women explained it all to me. I wasn<APO>t aware of exactly who did what. I really enjoy reading your posts and all the suggestions you make. Take care, Annette""Call your local crisis line or 911 if you truly feel the way you say you do. We cannot help you nearly as well as professionals can for medical and mental health issues. As far as your job is concerned, you may have taken too much sick time for them to continue your paycheck, and/or benefits. Even with FMLA you can only take up to three months off per 12 month period.Perhaps with two surgeries you have gone past that. You can still get COBRA health insurance for awhile, but it is pretty pricey. It does not cost $20,000 though, for my husband and I it would have come to about $700/month, we opted to go on Medicare. That has worked out well for us. Discuss this with your human resources dept., ask for everything in writing, so you can have someone help you go over it. Take care, Annette""As a person with FMS, migraines, and DDD of the cervical spine, I would say not to focus on any one thing having to do with your pain, deal with them all. Of course, dealing with FMS causes its own set of challenges. I had surgery in January, 2011 to reduce the size of my breasts, that alone reduced my back, shoulder, neck pain a lot. I take half of the long acting pain meds that I used to prior to the surgery. I believe that the pain I felt there was amplified by the FMS, but getting rid of the pain trigger helped a lot. On the advice of a pain management specialist, I also added an NSAID to my meds about two weeks post op, after I stopped the blood thinner. He explained why this would help any post surgical patient and that made sense to me. Could taking them also be why I am doing so well on my pain meds though? After discussing it with my pcp who manages my pain meds, I decided to continue taking ibuprofen for now. I have some very early OA, and she, my pcp, felt that pain from that was perhaps triggering worse episodes of FMS pain. That also makes sense to me, so I am still taking it. My belief has always been that anything that helps control your pain even a little bit, might be useful when joined up with other things that also help a little bit. The cumulative amount of pain control may well be worthwhile. I take gabapentin as a help for FMS pain, I also take NSAIDs, opioids to change my perception of pain, and ambien to improve my sleep. As I KNOW that a lack of sleep changes my perception of pain. I also do a lot of stuff, my hot tub gets used daily, I exercise daily, stretch daily, etc. Take care, Annette""If you need PT to strengthen your back and abdominal muscles, ask your doctor if you can belly dance? I do it at night after my husband goes to bed. I use the TV Fitness Channel program ""Shimmy"" and DVDs that I have ordered on line. It will be one year for me at the end of this month. I have lost weight, without dieting at all, and I feel more fit, agile, and all round better. It does not change the amount of pain I have though. If you are up at night anyway???? It is fun and easy, I will never be a great dancer, but it is great exercise. It is really hard for me to get started, but once I do I hate to stop after one hour. Take care, Annette""Hi, Bet I have known one person with FMS who had a spontaneous remission. She got completely well and has been for years now. Then again, my husband had stage four non-Hodgkin<APO>s Lymphoma 20 years ago and was told he would die in six months, and he well today. Who knows why? Hope should always go along with acceptance. We do not know what the researchers will come up with next year, or if we will just get well for no apparent reason. I believe the Vit. D thing is like the vit. B12 thing, too little and it can cause neuropathic pain. Part of testing for FMS should include vit D and B12 levels. If you are low, take supplements and see what happens, if you aren<APO>t low, don<APO>t bother. I was close to the low range for vit. D and my doctor put me on 2,000 IU per day, it has made no difference in my symptoms at all, but my blood levels are closer to mid-range now. I think I would have done just as well getting more sunshine for 30 minutes a day. Hugs, Annette""I record the TV shows on my DVR and replay them at my convenience, that way I can FF through the commercials, lol. The DVDs go into our five disc player, and I can skip from one to another as I prefer. The DVDs are better in my opinion. I went to OceanStateMedia.com and bought cheap DVDs there. There site is great and easy to use. I really like Jenna<APO>s ""Bellydancing: Basics and Beyond"" and ""Bellydancing: The Next Level"". That is where I would suggest starting out. Sadie<APO>s ""Complete Bellydance Guide"" and Autumn Ward<APO>s ""Bellydance, Beautiful Technique from Step One"" were both good. I also enjoy Sarah Skinner<APO>s DVDs. Neena and Veena, the twins, I didn<APO>t find very enjoyable or useful. Always be sure you do their warm-ups first. Once you have done one, you will know if it is for you, and get a better idea of which way to go. Let me know if you find others that you really like. They all seem to approach things differently, Jenna is down to earth, and easy to listen to and follow. Sadie is athletic and drives you harder, she pushes you to use your abs. Autumn Ward is very artistic and detailed in technique, she pushes you to use your legs. Sarah Skinner is fun and encourages you to try things your own way. Her ""Opulent Motion"" DVD is great. I think there are lots of right ways to dance, it is mainly what part of your body you want to work on the most. You can opt to move around a lot on the floor if you have the space or to mostly dance in a smaller space. moondancebellydance.com has cheap to more pricey costumes and dance gear. I have found it fun to get dressed up for dancing. I feel like I have completely recovered from my surgery in January. I still have the occasional twinge of discomfort along the incision line, but all the swelling and bruising is gone. I went from a 46-who knows what size cup, to a 40C. Medicare paid for most of it. My surgeon was not surprised at all, she said that insurance companies are much more likely to pay these days as now all the problems of being oversized cost more than the original surgery does. She had to be sure to remove a certain amount of tissue so they would pay, but she said that is easy to calculate ahead of time and that she has never been denied. Another surgeon that I called, never even saw me, I asked his receptionist for an appt. and explained why, she asked me how tall I was and how much I weighed, and said that Medicare would not approve it and hung up. I think it was bogus and he just didn<APO>t like dealing with Medicare. Medicare told me they never heard of that, and my surgeon that did the surgery also pooh-poohed it, she said that they hadn<APO>t done that for years. My internist, the surgeon, my pain management specialist and a hematologist/oncologist (I saw him due to previous clots with surgery) all thought it was a good idea for me. I remember years ago, I assumed my insurance would not pay for it, because they had a height/weight requirement so you had to lose weight to a ""normal"" weight first back then. I really did not believe they would cover it now, but they did. If I were you, I would recheck with your doctor to make sure it would be considered ""medically necessary"", see a couple of board certified plastic surgeons, and run it by your insurance company again if it seems like a good thing for you. My internist<APO>s medical asst. had it done in her 20s and her insurance covered it. I am SO glad I had it done. I have still not heard from any woman who had it and regrets it. Even a woman on another board here who had lots of complications is glad she had it done. My husband who rubs my back for me, noticed right away that I did not have the tightness, and knots in my back that I had before surgery. That has been there as long as I can remember, my pcp commented on it at least as far back as 1989 that I recall. Hugs, Annette""I had no suggestions when I started, so I went with the cheaper ones first, lol. I saw Sadie and her partner, Katie, bellydance on ""America<APO>s Got Talent"" so I added her to my list. Enjoy, it is great exercise if nothing else. Hugs, Annette""I totally forgot to mention one DVD that I really enjoy it is with Sarah Skinner, it is called ""Bellydance-Opulent Motion"". It is slower music and she shows you the basics, then encourages you too do what you can and improvise also while teaching you flows of movement. It is much more dancing than athletics or exercise, but you can do most of it in a small space if you need to. Hugs, Annette""That is the same program that got me started belly dancing. Now I order DVDs online and have tried a variety of instructors. I used to swim, but I got so I hurt so bad afterwards it just wasn<APO>t worth it anymore. it doesn<APO>t hurt while I am swimming, but afterwards it is terrible. Keep on dancing!!! Take care, Annette""I totally agree with you about labels. I am a person first, and I happen to have a few medical conditions also. I am also on SSDI, the SSA labeled me as disabled. I found that going through their process, they do not use a diagnosis to justify disability, they want to know how your diagnosis alters your ability to work for a living. I worked for years with DDD in my cervical spine as a nurse, that is not why I became disabled. Not even related. I was not self labeled with DDD, my doctors gave me that diagnosis. I did not even have pain from my neck, I had functional deficits in my hands, and later on some numbness. I don<APO>t think of myself as disabled other than that I cannot work for a living anymore, or at tax time, when they ask that dreaded question. I think a diagnosis is a ""label"" given by a MD to a patient. I think you and I agree on the real issue, perhaps not the words, I am not sure. I am curious, in your opinion, what is the difference between a diagnosis and a label? Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know how it works in Canada. I live in the state of Oregon in the US, and the state tax form has a place to add a disabled deduction right near the top. Our federal government has not done that yet. I didn<APO>t have to prove anything, no forms for the doctors to sign. I am getting SSDI from the federal government so it isn<APO>t like they don<APO>t know I am disabled. Take care, Annette""I thought we agreed on the basics, we do! Thanks, for the explanation. Take care, Annette""You can get Marinol by RX in all states, it is synthetic THC, thought to be the active ingredient in marijuana. Some folks prefer getting all the ingredients the natural way, but it is something you could try. I would agree that nausea is a normal adverse effect of opiates rather than an allergic reaction. Beth has had a great response to her spinal cord stimulator, of course, it does help to have insurance to cover it. Take care, Annette""I would never have surgery based on a single opinion, talk to at least one more hand surgeon and a neurologist. It could also be your neck that is causing weakness in one arm/hand. I would personally not have surgery and it attendant risks for intermittent numbness that only happens in certain positions at night. How long does it take to ""wake up"" your hand in the AM when you get up? I have known people with carpal tunnel syndrome that never had any surgery at all, and others that did. It is not an emergency, talk to more MDs and get all your questions answered. I had weakness in my dominant hand that got worse and worse, I had a surgery in my cervical spine that fixed it, but six months later, I herniated the disc below that one. I have not had weakness, only numbness with certain positions of my head/neck. I have opted not to have more surgery. That was in the early 1990s. It is not better, but it isn<APO>t worse either. Take care, Annette""I would see a neurologist, not a surgeon. Get a full evaluation and ask what ALL your treatment options are. Surgeons tend to only want to cut, and don<APO>t always know what other options there might be. Best of luck. Take care, Annette""Sometimes pain IS the problem. Not all chronic pain can be cured. Sometimes pain gets out of control and it is no longer a symptom of a physical or mental problem that can be fixed itself. It would be nice though if it was curable. Take care, Annette""Thank you for your military service, whether voluntary or not. You still went. I happen to agree with you about our sad state of affairs in the health care industry in the US. Take care, Annette""My understanding is that the vit. D issue applies to all chronic pain conditions, not just FMS. A lack of vit. D can increase neuropathic pain from what I have read, they are finding out more and more about it every day. It seems to be the vitamin d<APO>jour lately. Hugs, Annette""I agree. Every mother I have known including myself and my mom developed one hip slightly higher and out to the side simply from carrying a baby/toddler on our hip around the house. In the olden days, doctors asked right away if you had kids, and if so, how you carried them and how much. If you have back/body pain see your family MD, then a neurologist or a rheumatologist, then go from there. I would avoid chiropractors unless you are sent there by an MD who has already made a diagnosis. Take care, Annette""It is just my personal experience that it might be good to see a neurologist. Orthopedic docs are surgeons, and neurosurgeons are surgeons also. They do surgery to fix things. A neurologist does diagnostic work then tells you what kinds of treatments might help you. He is not a surgeon. He might suggest PT, medications, etc. He might send you to a surgeon if he thinks that will help. It was my experience when I went to see doctors for my health issues that non-surgeons seemed to offer me more than surgery, and surgeons only offered surgery. When you talk to the surgeons that you go see, ask them what they expect as far as success with your condition and their surgical treatment. Then ask them to define success for you. I found that many surgeons considered a surgery successful if pain was decreased by 50%, but when I spoke with other patients, they defined success as being rid of pain completely. You have to at least agree on the definition of terms that you both use. I really believe that having the right expectations is very important to the success of any surgery. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""The nerve could also be affected somewhere in your neck, shoulder, or wrist. Have you seen a neurologist yet? Take care, Annette""Remember that an orthopedic surgeon usually wants to do surgery to fix things, a neurologist focuses on the nerves, but not on a surgical treatment. Get more than one opinion if possible before doing anything invasive. Take care, Annette""I didn<APO>t know what ""ortop."" meant in your last post to me. What does it stand for anyway? A neurologist does not do surgery of any kind to untangle nerves, he does diagnostic stuff and non-surgical treatments. Did you see a neurologist who suggested you see a neurosurgeon to have that done, or did you see a neurosurgeon? Take care, Annette""I am so glad I was of help. Thanks for letting me know what you found out. Take care, Annette""Make an earlier appt. if possible, but tell the doctor face to face how you are doing, and that the meds are not helping. There are all kinds of different meds and non-medicine treatment to try for back pain. The back pain may not even be related to the bulging discs. Do your research while you wait to see the doctor, just on back pain and diagnosis. ""Arthritis Today"" has had a number of excellent articles on Back Pain in the last couple of years. Take care, Annette""How much do you weigh? Are you taking any other meds at all? I have never heard of opioids causing increased blood sugars. I don<APO>t know everything though, perhaps the doctor will respond. If not ask again and put Dr. Maine<APO>s name in the heading. Take care, Annette""See an MD, get a diagnosis, and come back. Maybe someone here has the same thing and can offer what has helped them. Take care, Annette""You need to talk to the prescribing doctor and/or your pharmacist. You might also need to be very careful about reading labels to make sure you don<APO>t take more than your doctor recommends in tylenol per day or per dose. Take care, Annette""There is also a maximum you should take per dose, not just per day. Take care, Annette""That is true for a normal, healthy person according to what I have read. Take care, Annette""I am glad to hear you discussed this with your own doctor, we all have a different medical history and the doctor knows you better than we do. Take care, Annette""Not all pain specialists take you off of all your drugs and start over. I would see a pain management specialist, but talk to them before you make an appt. make sure they use all kinds of treatments, not just injections and procedures. Take care, Annette""AARP has all kinds of clinics to help do your taxes and file them electronically. We did ours Monday with their help. It is the second year we have used them. FREE. Make an appt. way ahead of time, or just drop in and see if someone else didn<APO>t show up. The lady that did ours, said they had lots of no shows, and plenty of time to help others without appts. this year. I am organized with my papers, so pulling the necessary stuff takes less than 2 hours, usually less than one hour. I don<APO>t stress about taxes as long as I have someone do it for us. Take care, Annette""Disability is not based on your diagnoses but on whether or not you can work with them or not. If you feel that you can no longer work, then you have to make that decision and apply for SSDI or whatever disability you are aiming at. Please do not feel like you need to justify that decision to me. I know how difficult a decision that is, and I would believe you flat out, unless you gave me a reason not to, lol. You haven<APO>t yet. Take care, Annette""Ditto what Bet said. However, the age of consent varies from state to state. I live in Oregon and the age of consent here for medical care is 15. If you live where it is 18, and do not have insurance, use your search engine to look for free or low cost medical clinics. You have to see a doctor to get diagnosed. Take care, Annette""Bet did not say anything rude or condescending to you. I did not know until I moved to Oregon that there was anywhere that the legal medical consent age was less than 18 for non-reproductive health concerns. Bet and I are both nurses, and chronic pain patients also. We have both met plenty of young people who for whatever reason do not discuss their health problems with their parents, I am glad you have already. The only thing that is ""obvious"" is what you have posted in black and white. Folks come here for a variety of reasons, but we cannot diagnose anything here, nor can you accurately diagnose yourself with ""pseudo locking"" or anything else. Even I do not try to diagnose myself on line. I see my MD and after she gives me her thoughts, I do my research and see what the two of us can come up with. The examination done by a trained doctor is a very important part of making a diagnosis. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""You need to see a doctor to have an examination and medical history done. That way he can help you and your parents figure out what is wrong and what to try to do to help you. There are free and low cost clinics in many areas where you don<APO>t need insurance or a lot of cash up front. Try calling the Goodwill, Salvation Army, Catholic Charities, etc. and ask about what is available in your community. Try Googling ""Volunteers in Medicine"", they have free clinics in many areas. Or just Google ""free medical clinics"". Check with your school, they may know of a clinic you could go to. Some schools have free medical clinics, as do some county medical clinics. Bartering is another thing to try, If your parents have usable skills, they may be able to trade that skill for basic medical care for your family. My hubby is a mechanic and he used to trade his skills for medical care. Those doctors needed their cars maintained and repaired. Good luck to you. Take care, Annette""Only a doctor can tell you for sure. My husband had a traumatic injury that kept healing and breaking open for a couple of years. He finally saw an infectious disease doctor and a vascular specialist. They fixed him up but he had to have vascular surgery to remove a damaged vein under the wound. It healed shut and has stayed shut since. Take care, Annette""Try calling the drug companies, your doctor, your pharmacist, or going to www.needymeds.com and checking out what you need. It all depends what meds you take. WalMart has good program for cheap generic meds. Talk to your doctor about switching over from brand name drugs to generics if possible. It can be tough being the wife of a man who has kids already, it is his responsibility to support his kids first. Take care, Annette""You need to discuss this all with your doctor face to face. Valium should never be stopped abruptly as withdrawal symptoms can happen. Valium withdrawal can be deadly. I wouldn<APO>t blame this on your doctor not wanting to hear your side effects, you opted to stop taking valium for 24 hours after having unusual symptoms. Read the inserts that come with your drugs. Take care, Annette""After having worked with methadone patients in the early 1970s, I would never opt to mix benzos and opiates. That said, I would still see your doctor about getting off the benzos, rather than doing it myself. Benzos can cause seizures when withdrawn abruptly, discuss this with your doctor, I am not a doctor and never try to take the place of one. About 15 years ago, I began taking a generic of MS Contin twice a day, and a generic Norco, a short acting opioid, as a BT pain med as needed. The only side effect I have ever had from opioids is constipation, that is a side effect that is ongoing. It is one of the rare opioid side effects that does not seem to go away over time. All doctors have their own favorite kind of bowel care program. I continue on two different opioids today, a long acting one and a short acting one for BT pain. I am not sure what you mean by how did my body react to the short acting opioid while the long acting one was still in my system. It works and helps deaden the pain. Nothing ever really gets rid of the pain altogether, except sitting in my hot tub, and that only lasts as long as I sit in it. I really do not believe that any one opioid is any ""better"" than another, show me the evidence based studies and I will take another look at it. I think it is more a matter or dosing than anything. Some people seem to be more sensitive to certain side effects with certain opioids. Take care, Annette""I never felt any lightheadedness when I started on opiate therapy, or since being on it. Just me, I guess. When my son was deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq my anxiety levels became quite high, especially during his third and last deployment. I used cognitive behavioural therapy to deal with anxiety and had used it for depression many years ago. It worked so well I did not use other meds like benzos. You might look into it, I am not saying you would not need meds, that is between you and your doctor. CBT just worked really well for me. I am glad you have not been having as many panic attacks. I personally feel that benzos are just bad drugs (especially when used by folks who are on opiates) for the most part, for most people, and in most cases. Just my opinion, we all have one. The constipation stays with most folk who are on opiates, you might discuss with your doctor what he likes best as far as bowel care. Our pharmacist did suggest Miralax to my husband back when he needed help due to opiates he used to be on. I am glad to hear that your anesthesiologist thinks of neurostimulators as a last ditch effort to manage pain, that is good news. Bet tried many different medicines, etc. before getting hers. All treatments for pain should start with the least invasive and work up to invasive techniques. So, don<APO>t growl at him, just be glad you have a doctor who is not procedure happy. Take care, Annette""CBT must be used for the rest of your life, but so do drugs don<APO>t they? It has worked for me for depression and anxiety, and others use it for addiction and other problems. The book I used was specifically for mood disorders, anxiety is one. Give it a try for the anxiety, it may help. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know which meds you cannot take due to your blood sugars, but I would change pcps if mine refused to give me a referral to a pain management doctor if I was in pain and she could not fix it. That is ignorant. Aging does NOT cause pain, either. Would the rheumy consider giving you a referral instead? Lots of folks with diabetes take meds for FMS, you might check out the FMS Board here and see what other people are doing. Take care, Annette""I would see a neurologist. I don<APO>t know what is causing your pain but that would probably be a place to begin. Some types of migraines include neurological symptoms like tingling and flashing lights in the visual field. Another thought would be to check your blood pressure before, during and after one of these episodes. High blood pressure can cause all kinds of problems and is pretty common in the African American population. Does your mom, dad, or siblings have high blood pressure? Have you had yours checked recently? Keep a journal of your symptoms for awhile. Note the time they start and end, when you take your medicines, what you eat, etc. After you do that for a couple of months you may find triggers or trends that would help you and your doctor figure it out. Take care, Annette""I think losing 3 pounds in six weeks is just fine. I have been losing slowly like that and now I am 54 pounds lighter than I was at my heaviest. My buddies who only want to lose 20 pounds all at once, are still at their heaviest. They threw up their arms and gave up immediately. One is now diabetic and another is pre-diabetic. If you are not working outside the home right now, make your health your priority. If you need to sleep after you work out, then sleep. Don<APO>t work out to lose weight, work out to enjoy better health. Find an activity that you really enjoy, and do that. I also believe in volunteering. Find something to do with yourself, where you must get up and get dressed and go out at least once a week. There are all kinds of opportunities available for volunteers, from one time things like events, to scheduled activities like walking dogs at the animal shelter, or reading to kids for an hour a week. We can all do something for an hour a week. We can recover the rest of the week if need be. Take care, Annette""My doctor says she prescribes as much as 3600 mg. per day for chronic pain. I have taken up to 1800 mg. a day, and presently take 800 mg. per day. Your friend should discuss it with his doctor if there is concern. Everyone has a different medical history. Take care, Annette""I looked it up in my drug book and it says 3600 mg. per day is the maximum dose, but I feel everyone should always discuss it with their own doctors because every case is different. Gabapentin is also a seizure med and your doctor felt it was safe for you to go higher in your daily dose and to stop the Dilantin. I think being able to stop another drug is remarkable as long as you and your doctor agreed on that. I also consider it a miracle drug for what it has done to help me. Take care, Annette""Change your ""bad"" habits, and then if you still have the same feelings go back and see the doctor again. I think many people don<APO>t bother to go back and be re-evaluated, that is to their own detriment. Doctors often diagnose things with a bit of time to see where the symptoms go next. Take care, Annette PS, Be sure to keep your folks informed of what is going on.""Hi, I am a retired nurse. I would suggest he see a neurologist for a work up, then some kind of psychologist perhaps. Perhaps migraines of some kind, since he has headache medicine??? Just a thought. I have a history of migraines, and had a stroke like episode with very strange neurological symptoms. It all passed though. Do not ignore him or write it off as psychological without a workup though. A patient of mine years ago started out as a teenager who had symptoms that she ""made up"". It turned out she had a serious, progressive neurological condition and ended up comatose. She and her mom might have had some more quality time together rather than fighting with each other over this. Sounds like you are the kind of nurse every parent wants in the schools where their kids go. Few would take the time to post looking for answers. Take care, Annette""Please tell your doctor all these things, especially how it affects your daily life, like going to the gym, and walking your dog. Taking one half a Vicodin may not be enough to make it work, that is not a theraputic dosage. If you take it as prescribed when you need it, as soon as you need it, you will take less, and feel better, than if you wait until it really hurts bad, and then under treat it. There was a medical study done many years ago that studied just that. Don<APO>t compare your pain to someone else<APO>s, yours is what it is, and it is affecting how you live your life. If your primary care doctor doesn<APO>t know how to treat your pain when you come clean about how much it hurts you, then see a pain management specialist. When your sling comes off and you are ready, you need to be outside walking your dog. Take care, Annette""I keep a little note pad nearby and jot down all my questions and concerns to save for when I see my doctor. Tell him the TRUTH about how you feel, don<APO>t sugar coat things. He is there to help you. Surgeons are not trained to prescribe pain meds over the long term, so I would ask my pcp rather than a surgeon. Take care, Annette""Get a divorce and maybe you will do better financially. I don<APO>t know what is available in NYS for welfare for folks without kids. Check out free or low cost clinics, I volunteered at a free clinic in my community for nine years. We gave very good care, and could refer folks to specialists through a county program. I live on the western end of the country, so I don<APO>t know what is available where you live. I did find a free clinic for a friend in Florida on line. If you were an 18 year old with seven kids, you would have started having them at age 11 if you had one per year. Would you really want to be that person? Take care, Annette""Make an appt. to see your pcp and ask him to fully explain the MRI to you. GI docs know nothing about spinal MRIs so it is good that the GI doc at least told you that. Your pcp is more able to judge whether or not you are a candidate for spinal surgery than the GI doc because he had access to your labs, and knows you better. It may well be that he did not see anything on the MRI that surprised him, because he already knew about your pain problems. Don<APO>t try and figure this out on line, talk to your pcp. Take care, Annette""Until they invent a website that can examine you and take an accurate history, I think you are out of luck. The MRI results are one doctor<APO>s opinion of the MRI film, a radiologist who has never seen you either. Then your doctor(s) look at either the results or the films/DVD/digital copy of the MRI and with what they already know about you, they give you their opinion. If he went to fast, you need to speak up and ask questions, or make another appt. to just talk about the MRI and your spinal problems. Your family doctor sees more than just the spine, so he already knows you are not a candidate for surgery, your pain management doctor also seems to know this about you. What they do not address is that even so, to get the best result from whatever treatments they might use, YOU must understand as much as is humanly possible about your conditions. Including your MRI results. I would not bother with layfolk on line, and I would set up another appt., tell your pcp that if he cannot explain it to you, you would like a referral to someone who can. My husband had a bleed in his head and the best doctor he had was a neurologist who also read his own scans. You might do better with some kind of specialist. Your pcp may not know the best way to explain it to you. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Because their job is to sell drugs, the drug companies tell the doctors through their reps that this is a great new drug, good pain relief, no withdrawal syndrome, no addiction, etc. My personal experience is that there is no such thing as a decent pain med without withdrawals. That said, tell your doctor you want off of it, and follow his instructions for tapering off slowly to avoid withdrawals. One should never wean themselves off of any drug, discuss it with your doctor!! Take care, Annette""Suboxone contains two drugs, buprenorphine and naloxone. Buprenorphine is a mixed opiate agonist and antagonist. I don<APO>t believe it is the only drug in that class. Buprenorphine is considered an opioid according to my ""Drug Information Handbook for Advanced Practice Nursing"". It displays weak kappa antagonist activities and partial mu agonist activities. It causes dependency and withdrawal symptoms when stopped abruptly. Also according to the same book. When it is in a formula by itself it is called Subutex. Suboxone also includes naloxone and is a labeled treatment for opioid dependence only. Keep in mind that once a drug is approved by the FDA, many doctors will use them off label unless the FDA prohibits it, and it rarely does. Naloxone is a pure opioid antagonist, and is used to reverse the effects of opioids and often initiates withdrawal symptoms when injected into the blood stream of a person on opioids. It is only used via injection for this purpose. When mixed with oral opioids it does not work unless the pills are crushed and injected, then it puts you into withdrawal if you have any kind of opioid in your system. (Naltrexone is different and comes in an oral form by itself.) Subutex and Suboxone are not the same drug formula, one has naloxone in it and one does not. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know if your sister is bipolar or not. I do suspect that perhaps she wasn<APO>t really clean and sober, and honest with her doctors about her addiction problems when she was diagnosed as bipolar. No one can be accurately diagnosed with any mental health problem while they are addicted to drugs, in my opinion. Many problems are genetic, or at least there are genetic components. The fact that your brother shot himself may be related to your sister<APO>s problems. I wish I could tell you a way to help her for sure, but I can<APO>t. I would see a therapist yourself and tell her/him what is going on and ask for direction. It may be that the best you can do is to help yourself learn to deal with the family issues you have. Drug abuse and mental health issues like bipolar are very complex. If she is taking anything other than opiates on a regular basis, withdrawals can be deadly. Take care, Annette""I was way younger back in the days when I gave husband #2 more than one chance. His shrink at the VA called me to tell me he had threatened to take our son from me, and kill him and commit suicide. He said the law required him to warn me of bodily threats. Having a child to look after seems to clear ones mind. Our son never spent any more time alone with his dad, only with me or a trusted relative present. Never again. He was mentally ill at that time, but still, one has to protect children. I am so glad you are already there. No one should be afraid of their partner, ever. Anneliese is such a beautiful name. She is lucky to have a mom like you. Hugs, Annette""Same to you and yours. Hugs, Annette""I take gabapentin for FMS, I have for about 10-12 years now. I was afraid of the sedating side effects and refused to even try it for a long time. A couple of years after she first brought it up, my doctor told me that she was using it just once a day for her chronic pain patients and it was working just as well in regards to pain relief. That way it helped them sleep and they often slept through any sedation from the drug. I started at 300 mg. per day at bedtime, and increased it by 300 mg. once a week until I got up to 1800 mg. per day at bedtime. I felt a bit ""drunk"" at first, but that wore off completely after a month or two. I felt a bit lethargic during the day, just tired, not drunk. After I discussed that with my doctor, I backed off the same way I went up until I felt more myself. I ended up at 900 mg. per day at bedtime. Then I adjusted the time I took it slightly earlier in the evening, Now other than having less pain, fewer migraines, and less bowel and bladder problems, I wouldn<APO>t know I was taking it. I have no side effects at all. I tried Lyrica but it did not work as well, and it cost alot more, so I went back to gabapentin. I use a generic, have since they came out. With all drugs you do not know until you try them what kinds of side effects YOU will have. Nor do you know how long they will last. Many side effects go away on their own after a little while. Your doctor and pharmacist will know what side effects you can expect might go away and which ones you may have to continue to deal with. Constipation with opiates is pretty much going to continue for everyone, very few people claim it goes away. Nausea and itching do go away for most people who take opiates though. The same is true for other drugs. Everyone responds differently to them. Take care, Annette""Hey, Bet I am so sorry you have found yourself in the situation you are in. I know you thought you had found the perfect guy. If going to therapy and working out trust issues will help keep you and Kevin together in a HEALTHY WAY, go for it. But, when you say you are afraid of him, it might be time to let it go with him. I went through a similar thing with my second husband after we were married, no computers, but he went through all my personal letters, old diaries, etc., I never trusted him again. I am older now and I wish I hadn<APO>t wasted anymore time on him at all. I realize now it was him, not me. He had issues with trust and needed to make sure I was telling him everything. That was not the right way to go about it. I was always honest with him. He didn<APO>t find anything he did not already know about. By the way, after about a ten year cooling off period, I met my present husband. We have been together 21 years now. So, had I not left husband #2, I would not be happily married to husband #3. All<APO>s well that ends well. You do what you think is best for you and your daughter. I am sure you will anyway. Read those books. Hugs, Annette""See a doctor and get it examined and properly diagnosed. Keep in touch. Meanwhile you might try keeping it elevated above the level of your heart. Take care, Annette""There is a block that can be administered via a very small catheter placed inside the incision. The medicine that goes into the catheter is a numbing drug rather than an opioid. My husband had one of these with his hip replacement surgery. They are used a lot by the GI doctors on men hurt in battle during our present wars. You might try speaking to a doctor that does high risk surgeries, at a university medical center perhaps. Take care, Annette""I would be very leery of taking opiates in addition to Xanax. My personal opinion. I attended a class on pain management for health care professionals a year or so ago and the instructor told us that mixing benzos and opiates was a really bad idea due to their interactions with each other. She said that research was in the works that bore this out and that soon doctors who kept up on things would not even consider it. This only brought home my own experiences years ago with opiate addicts on methadone treatment in a treatment facility where I worked. We told the clients 40 years ago that benzos would not be tolerated while they were on methadone. Respiratory depression and falling were biggies back then when these two kinds of drugs were mixed. If you have no leanings towards addiction or alcoholism I don<APO>t think addiction should even be an issue. Be aware but don<APO>t fret about it. The percentages of pain patients who become addicted to their meds is very small. Kelly and Charles explained dependence and addiction very well. Take care, Annette""You need to go see your primary care doctor for an exam, and maybe some blood tests. Only he can make a diagnosis for you. B12 deficiency can cause neuropathic pain, but it is easy to check your B12 level with a blood test. I am not aware that it would cause swelling in your feet though. I had this test done a few years back. Mine was fine. Write down all your symptoms, and all your questions, and take these lists to your doctor along with a list of any medicines you take, including over the counter ones and supplements. Once you see him and get some idea of what is going on, come back, maybe one of us has had similar problems and can offer suggestions of how to cope. Take care, Annette""Morphine is the only medication in morphine. Take care, Annette""Don<APO>t feel bad, just go tell the doctor what is going on. Often as time goes by and you develop new and different symptoms, the picture becomes more clear and the doctor figures it out. Take care, Annette""I would start with a regular family doctor or internal medicine doctor. There are free and low cost clinics in many communities, you will have to hunt for one as they don<APO>t usually spend money on advertising. I volunteered at one in my community for about 9 years. Has your husband ever had his blood sugar checked to see if he might be diabetic? Diabetes can cause neuropathic pain in the feet. Keep in touch. Take care, Annette""Did you diagnose the neuropathy because it seems like it to you, or did the doctor see him already? My husband was on his feet on concrete floors as a mechanic and his feet started to hurt for awhile. We tried pricey shoes, etc., but nothing seemed to really help. The pain went away after awhile as mysteriously as it came on. Take care, Annette""I would find a good sports medicine physician or neurologist if you can<APO>t find a sports medicine guy, and then stick with him until he figures it out. Make sure he has all your latest films and tests, but if they are older he may ask you to redo them, that is reasonable. I feel you have to be your own advocate, stand up and tell them that this is affecting your life now and you are not willing to stop until you figure it all out. Take care, Annette""Hi, Caprice They gave us a book from Stanford Hospital that lists at $19.99 so that alone is major for a free class. My husband and I both say we can always learn something new from any class. I am sure I will. Hugs, Annette""I am taking a six week class on living with a chronic condition. It is given for free by a local hospital group. I will let you know if I learn anything new and exciting. Almost everyone in the room had chronic pain of some sort. Take care, Annette""What is femara? I tried looking it up in my medical encyclopedia but did not have any luck. Is treating this kind of muscle/bone/joint pain any different than other pain affecting the same structures? Does the femara preclude certain kinds of treatments? Take care, Annette""Thanks for the link, I went and read about it. It mentioned joint and extremity pain as side effects, but did not mention any problems with using the usual treatments for pain. I would discuss this with the prescribing doctor and see what he suggests. Lots of time cancer doctors have little tricks up their sleeves for these kinds of side effects. Take care, Annette""See your doctor. Your symptoms may well be unrelated to the Percocet. If they are related, he is the only one who can fix it. Take care, Annette""I personally found that ibuprofen in larger than OTC amounts works better than most opiates for dental pain. I have read medical research that showed this to be true for others also. Did some doctor prescribe 30 mg. of hydrocodone to you? Or did you take that on your own? If a doctor gave it to you, go back to him and see if he will do it again. If not, you may have screwed yourself in the short term. The good news is that tolerance resets itself in 4-5 days according to my old rheumatologist, This is why drug holidays often work. If you are no longer taking the hydrocodone, it shouldn<APO>t take long before a ""normal"" theraputic dose of 5-10 mg. works for you. Take care, Annette""Most dental pain is caused by swelling of the tissues, the antibiotic deals with this basic reason you hurt by getting rid of inflammation and infection. If most of your pain is caused by infection, the Clindamycin should help with the pain, if not it may not help. Only your dentist can make that call. That said I would still hurt during that process and might need opiate pain relief. Has this person ever used illegal drugs or taken prescription drugs in a way other than they were prescribed? Is there anything else we should know? My intuition tells me there may be more to this story, but my intuition has been wrong in the past, LOL. Take care, Annette""Don<APO>t snap on him when he tells you you do not have pain, just repeat over and over, if necessary, that you DO have pain and require some kind of opiate for the short term at least. I don<APO>t understand why a dentist would not give you a RX for a small amount of opiates. You have to do your part, and take them exactly as prescribed though. Take care, Annette""I would learn all you can about FMS, this helped me a lot. My favorite site for good medical info is http://www.myalgia.com . Your husband might need to read about it too so he is more understanding of what you are going through. It may be doubtful that you will ever be able to do the things you used to do easily, you may need to readjust your sights so what you can do fits your life better. I have FMS, I cannot work anymore, and can<APO>t do many things I used to do, but life is good, I am happy. Is the doctor who gives you vicodin a pain management specialist, an orthopedic surgeon, some other kind of surgeon, or what? What other meds do you take? Vicodin may be the right drug for you, or it may not be, a combination of drugs might work better for you. Perhaps seeing a rheumatologist might also help you. Keep in touch. Take care, Annette""I would ask him for a referral to someone else who might be able to help you if he can<APO>t. Or go see a neurologist, not a neurosurgeon, and ask what your alternatives are as far as treatment go. Take care, Annette""I suggested a neurologist, not another neurosurgeon. Neurosurgeons do surgery, neurologists do not do surgery. They are not interchangable. In my experience non-surgeons offer a number of different treatments, sometimes they will suggest you see a surgeon for that alternative. I have never been to a surgeon that suggested non-surgical treatment, they just tell you whether or not they have a surgical option for you. Just my opinion. Take care, Annette""My personal opinion is to do ALL of the things you have found helped you at all. I little bit of help from this and a little bit of help from that, plus whatever help you get from pain meds, and all together you get significant relief. Even if no one thing works well enough by itself, together you might get worthwhile help. Take care, Annette""Go see your own doctor or go to the nearest ER for help. It depends a lot what kind of meds you were on. Take care, Annette""I worked nights for 15 years for a number of reasons that felt right at the time. I was totally healthy back then. It has destroyed my health. I would stay up for my son for school or his doctor<APO>s appts. etc. or because I just couldn<APO>t sleep. I worked 12 hour shifts, back to back, with no sleep or only a couple of hours in between. Then I would crash and sleep a whole day away. (No drugs, alcohol or caffeine.) It is a bad idea. The human body repairs itself during sleep, you can<APO>t catch up on sleep on the weekend, what is lost is lost. We are not nocturnal animals. The only night nurse that it seemed to work for was a woman I worked with who slept during the day 7 days a week for 30 years, whether she was working or not. She got into a good sleep schedule and stuck with it, 24/7, 365 days a year. My son, 33, is stuck working nights now because he just started a new job, I have warned him to get off of nights as soon as possible, for his family<APO>s sake and his own. Take care, Annette""I still tend to go to bed early in the AM and sleep until 11am - 12 noon. Swing shift was the best for me and my natural rhythms, but not for after I had my son. I was single until he was about ten years old, and by then he could do what he needed to do anyway. But at least his step dad was there for him if he needed anything. I switched to day shifts when he was a teenager. I usually had in home help, a housekeeper/babysitter I gave room and board to in exchange for child care while I was working. That worked pretty well for us. I can<APO>t even imagine what it would have been like if his dad had stuck it out with us. Way easier, except it was like having another child to look after, lol. It is done now, my son is 33 and has kids of his own, and a lovely wife. He turned out great, and that is the main thing. I lived outside Reno for ten years, everything is open 24/7, I agree it is great to do shopping during the off hours, when it is quieter. It was pretty strange when I moved to Oregon and things were only open 9-9 and closed on Sundays. Take care, Annette""I am not an MD. That said, Oxycontin and Roxicodone both contain oxycodone as the opiate they have in them. The Roxycodone releases the medicine, in your care 30 mg. all at once into your system. Oxycontin delivers its dose slowly over time, so you get the 320 mg. per 24 hour day that is slowly released into your system. What happens for the patient is that they get a slower delivery system from their long acting med, in your case Oxycontin. That should treat the base amount of pain you have. Then when you are doing some extra activity that causes more pain than usual, or you just have extra pain that day, you take some of the Roxicodone as prescribed, that is called a break through pain medicine when used that way. Take care, Annette""A normal and natural side effect of using opiates like oxycodone is that you develop a tolerance to the medicine over time, and require more drug to get the same amount of relief. The alternative is that your pain is simply getting worse as your disease process continues. It could also be a combination of the two. Some doctors prefer a patient rotate to a different long lasting opiate for awhile. That is between you and your doctor. Discuss all you are learning here with him. Take care, Annette""I see two kinds of responses from many doctors, the ones that prescribe drugs for pain don<APO>t want to be forced to take yet another class during their already tight schedules, and the ones that don<APO>t use drugs much want more patients forced to try non-drug therapies that may or may not work. There is a conflict of interest here because they reap the benefits of patients being forced to try mind/body or interventional treatments. My personal objection is having the drug companies teach the care providers how to use THEIR drugs. As an RN I once was sent to a class (by the hospital I worked for) that was put on by a drug company that turned out to be an eight hour commercial on why we should use THEIR drug as opposed to another company<APO>s drug used for the same purpose. A year or so later the research came out that showed THEIR drug was much more expensive, but not any better. Drug companies have a bad reputation already as far as pushing their own agendas to make more money for themselves. I wouldn<APO>t, and don<APO>t trust much of anything they say. I would want an independent person teaching classes based on evidence based studies. We don<APO>t have a lot of good evidence based studies on one opiate drug vs. another opiate drug, only opiates vs. placebos. I personally believe that in the best possible world we would all try the least interventional approaches first. Mind/body approaches, acupuncture, PT, OT, biofeedback, psychotherapy, etc. etc. would come first, then oral drugs, then SCS and drug pumps and other kinds of injections and surgical procedures. But this is not the best possible world, everything costs time and $$$ and not all of us have those things, like Kelly said. I did all that mind body stuff first and had little or no benefit from it. I opted to use oral drugs because they worked the best for me, after trying many oral drugs, I opted for opiates, zolpidem and gabapentin. Now, here we are ten years later, I am in a different place now. I continue to take the same meds. Now, I find that exercise really does help me feel globally better, but I couldn<APO>t do it without my pain meds, because exercise makes my pain worse at a certain point. I wasn<APO>t offered pain meds along with exercise at the beginning, just exercise that caused increased pain. CBT was not offered to me back at the beginning, but it has also become a huge plus in my life. I had a breast reduction surgery, at 60 years of age, in January that cut my opiate use in half, no doctor EVER suggested it even though I have had all the medical problems associated with over-sized breasts for at least 30 years. I asked my internist if it might help my back/shoulder pain, then she said yes, and helped me get on the road to that surgery. Neither drugs nor mind/body interventions nor injections/surgical interventions will always help us on their own. We, as patients must be open to trying them all, over and over again sometimes. They may not work in one situation, but they may help us a lot in another situation at another time in our lives. Before we get drug companies involved in our doctor<APO>s educations, lets leave it up to patients and their doctors to try and work things out for the best pain control possible. There have been times I have been let down by my doctors, but I pulled up the slack, and there have been times my doctors have saved my life, literally. I feel we have to work as a team. I don<APO>t feel you can legislate these kinds of problems away. Addiction is a horrible disease, educate doctors in medical school about this problem. Provide more medical treatment for addicts instead of repeated incarceration. What about non-opiate addiction, things like alcoholism, benzo addiction, meth and cocaine addiction? Addiction is addiction, I worked in addiction treatment years ago for heroin addicts, many just changed to a different substance of abuse. Lets not just gloss over the topic, get down into it and fix the problem, don<APO>t just change the substance. Take care, Annette""I am a bit confused, you say in this post that your scar is 1 1/2-2 inches long, but in another post today you said it was 5 inches long. That is a huge difference??? Take care, Annette""I totally pre-check doctors especially surgeons. I always see more than one. I ask them how many of the surgeries I or my family member will have, have they done, what is their complication rate, infection rate, etc. I want numbers, not ""none"", or ""hardly any"". I also check out the hospital(s) they are affiliated with, and call the nursing station for the unit I would go to, and ask what their nurse/patient ratio is. I have found that is the greatest predictor of infection rates. I have even called recovery rooms and spoken to the nurses there. I also had an anterior cervical disc surgery and my scar doesn<APO>t show at all, he put it in the natural crease in the skin. I have to stretch my neck to the other side to show it to people. It is only an inch and half to two inches long. BeautifulBuffalo explained it down below. Hugs, Annette""You are right, now I am not confused. I agree with Swank. It does take awhile for the scar to fade away. Mine is almost completely invisible, it is in a crease on my neck. My son<APO>s plastic surgeon recommended he put sunblock on his facial scars to make them fade out faster and not turn dark. You might consider this once the skin is well healed. My son used it for at least a year. Take care, Annette""If you picked up the box that originally injured you at work, fill out an incident report as soon as possible. Worker<APO>s Comp may pick up the bill for you. It is best to fill out those forms or report the incident to your supervisor in writing immediately, but sometimes they will still take care of it, especially if someone at work knows it happened there and is willing to say so. Take care, Annette""He may have had a TIA, milder than a stroke and often doesn<APO>t show up on a scan. The symptoms often go away after a few days. My grandmother had one. There are lots of things that could cause these kinds of symptoms. Get all the tests back first, then try and see what might have happened to him. Epidurals don<APO>t always work, they can be harder to do one time than another, even for the same doctor on the same patient. In two days he went from the epidural, to tired and lethargic, to living in the past. I don<APO>t know if the epidural caused his present state or not. If he had just eaten hot dogs, would I blame it on that? No, I would want more information. One might never know what caused this event in his life, maybe it was coincidence, maybe the stress of the epidural triggered something else, I don<APO>t know. We never knew exactly why grandma had her TIA. I think the first thing to do is get him well. It sounds like the doctors are on the right trail by doing a scan and blood work, and waiting for the results before jumping into anything else. Take care, Annette""With your back and leg pain, you might not be the right person to be doing those things for your dad, even though you want to. Your own injuries may preclude you from being his caregiver. To find out, I would ask the doctor to send a home health care Occupational Therapist to your dad<APO>s home to see how you can do things easier. I was an RN in home health care for awhile and the OTs were great. They could break things down and teach folks to do them in such a way as to not cause further harm. Or ask your dad<APO>s doctor to get home health more involved in his care and the housekeeping. For instance, you said you are ""unable to stand to clean the wound"", why stand up? Nurses do things like that sitting when possible. This is just one thing you might learn how to do differently so as to cause you less pain. That aside, and back to your pain meds. The starting out dose of a new pain med, when switching over from a different one, should be started very low, then adjusted upwards to cover the pain appropriately. There is only a partial cross tolerance, so if you switch over to too high a dose, you could die of an overdose, then where would your dad be? When I changed my drug dose or switched to a new medicine, I expected to see my doctor in person more often, once it was adjusted properly, I went back to less frequent appts. My doctor and I went by my total daily dose of MS Contin (generic) per 24 hours. Sometimes I took it every 8 hours, sometimes I took it every 12 hours. She was happy to just double the total daily dose, but I wanted to increase it only by 50%. I wanted to then adjust the number of hours apart the doses were. She let me do it my way, after I explained it to her. Eight hours, twelve hours, both worked fine for me. Talk to your new doctor, but please do not compare him to his face with your old doctor. That is like comparing the new wife to the dead one, no one is ever happy with that comparison. Take care, Annette""I took generic Norco as a breakthrough med for many years, and my doctor just checked my liver enzymes regularly, they were always normal. I did not take any other tylenol containing products. Now I opt to use a breakthrough med without tylenol because it is cheaper. Although some doctors would just give you more MS Contin and no breakthrough meds, that would not be the standard of care in most places. The medical research shows that using a long acting opiate with a short acting one for breakthrough pain seems to give the best pain relief, and the fewest side effects. What other meds do you take? There may be other kinds of drugs that you could get through a special program that would decrease your opiates which are sometimes not covered. Have you checked through needy meds.com to see if you might be able to get any help with RX drugs? Take care, Annette""Hydrocodone/APAP comes with just 325 mg. of tylenol also, both as Norco and in generic form. I used the generic for many years with this level of tylenol in it. Discuss it with your doctor. Another suggestion is to try taking a long acting drug like generic MS Contin just at night so you sleep clear through the night, then use short acting meds in the day time. I did that at first. Just sleeping for a full 7-8 hours made a huge difference in my life. Check the prices though, often a larger quantity of pills is not that much more than a smaller quantity of the same pills. Take care, Annette""I would work with the pharmacist. Ask him/her what kind of IR meds they do carry, and then tell the doctor what is available. I am lucky, the pharmacies here have not had this problem. The only thing is oxycodone is only available in 5 mg. pills so my doctor has to order a quantity that seems silly for me. I take 15 mg. at a time, so I must take 3 pills at once. I guess I should just be glad that I can get them at all. I don<APO>t believe there is any magic that comes with oxycodone, I think it is all in the dosing, not the particular med that is given. I have been taking opiates daily for about 15 years, and only recently started using oxycodone. Take care, Annette""If you want cheap, methadone is the way to go. If the doctor increases the dose of her long acting med, she shouldn<APO>t need much BT medicine. Tell your MIL to talk to her doctor and let him know there is a financial aspect to her care. Most doctors are totally unaware of the cost of what they order. Take care, Annette""Ditto, me too. I am on oxycodone, and have no trouble at all getting it from my pharmacy with a legal RX. I will respond in more detail when your ""friend"" posts for herself. Take care, Annette""If oxycodone is not available, she should try one of the other kinds of immediate release meds that are available. There are lots of other kinds. Take care, Annette""I really miss living in the country. I loved sitting out on my porch at night. But, at this point in my life, I need to live closer to the things you find in the city. I agree that it is way worth it to do the things you love, and plan to pay for it later. I hate gardening, but I am so glad that you have the place and the will to go ahead and do it. Food does taste better fresh like that. Take care, Annette""Sorry, but this does not work for everyone. I live in a state where its use is permitted for medical reasons. I had smoked marijuana in my youth, and given it up many years ago for no particular reason. A decade or so ago, I tried it again to try and ease my chronic pain. I tried it both inhaled and ingested, and although I got high, it did not give me any pain relief. It wasn<APO>t even a nice high. So I opted not to use it anymore. I do support the use of it for those who get relief, but it does not work for everyone, just like all the other drugs we have available. There are no guarantees that anything will work. We are all different. Take care, Annette""Discuss all this with your parents and with your pcp. Back pain may be due to your ""unfortunately massive chest"", breast reduction surgery might help. That kind of plastic surgery is often considered medically necessary and is not restricted by insurance companies to young women of your age. Addiction is a small risk of opiate meds, discuss that with both your parents and your doctor honestly. There are other kinds of treatments that also may help your pain, you should not be taking massive amounts of over the counter meds, even they have some nasty side effects and should be monitored by a doctor. Tolerance is not one of the side effects of acetaminophen or ibuprofen, it is more likely that your pain is just getting worse. Take care, Annette""Breast augmentation surgery is to add volume to your breasts, breast reduction surgery is to reduce volume. I think she would want reduction if anything??? Take care, Annette""Don<APO>t worry about it, we all make the occasional error. That is why we are all here, what one person misses, another will catch. Your input is great. Take care, Annette""As long as you are following his directions, you should be fine. Many people think they can substitute taking OTC meds for actually seeing their doctor. It is not a good idea for any long term process. Why are you taking an aspirin along with ibuprofen? I am just curious, because both my internist and my pain management consult told me not to take the two together. Take care, Annette""Talk to your surgeon! The sutures they use to connect muscle tissue are very strong, unlikely to tear. However, he should know what you are experiencing and check you over. You didn<APO>t mention how long ago you had the surgery. This is extensive surgery and it takes about a year for the body to recover completely from any major surgery. Keep in touch. Take care, Annette""My doctor and I agreed that I would use a specific pharmacy. They know I come in every month, and check to make sure they have enough to fill my RX before they take it out of my hand. They always have enough. I suggest everyone get their new RX up to a week before they are due to run out, that way you have some slack if it takes a few days for the pharmacy to fill it. It would be nerve wracking to try and fill it the day I ran out. Take care, Annette""You need to see your doctor and have him look at your heel. The injury was when you stepped down and heard/felt a painful pop. Take care, Annette""A friend of mine had a microdiscectomy some years back and also had trouble afterwards, completely new sciatic pain, the surgeon disappeared faster than you can believe. Told her it wasn<APO>t the surgery and that he had nothing more to do for her. Sorry you are having problems too. Take care, Annette""I would go to your pcp and see what he says. That is what my friend did, rather sheepishly because the pcp had already told her that her back was not a surgical case. She is fine now, by the way. Take care, Annette""I agree with Kelly, avoid chiropractors and see an MD. My family practice doctor was good about dealing with whatever came up and referring me to a specialist as needed. So is my present pcp, she is an internist, but sends me to see other doctors if needed. I don<APO>t know about dealing with insurance, best of luck with that. Have you applied for SSDI? Medicare comes along with that, but it takes two years to be eligible. Take care, Annette""I only tell the truth from my own viewpoint, it may well be different from yours. That is okay. She was asking about taking anti-anxiety meds for tension headaches, you take them for panic attacks and back pain. It is comparing apples and oranges to me. Your situation and hers are totally different. Whether or not I agree with you using valium doesn<APO>t really matter, it is up to you and your doctor. Just like it is up to her and her doctor if she opts to use these kinds of drugs. I have a different set of experiences than you do, and I can only speak from my background not yours. My background as a patient and my professional background. I would not try and tell you about aerospace. Actually, I have used benzos in the past, and will never use them again if I have any choice in the matter. Just my opinion, from my experience. I went back an re-read every post of mine in this thread, and not once did I say that benzos are ""all bad"" or ""analogous to the plague"". I told her if she felt meds were necessary to see a psychiatrist about it. He is the kind of doctor with extra training to prescribe these kinds of meds. Take care, Annette""Sorry about how this came up on the board. I typed it in paragraphs that made more sense. I do not know what the ""br /"" in brackets x2 means, I did not type that in, but they seem to show up where I changed paragraphs. Take care, Annette""I never try and get between anyone and their own treatment given by their own doctor. However, I will say that my experiences, both as a patient taking benzos, and as a nurse taking care of patients taking benzos, have been more negative than positive. They had their place when we had no other treatments for anxiety that did what they did, now we do. Benzos are widely abused, and have been widely prescribed, but not always well prescribed. When I was a young nurse it was barbiturates, now they are rarely given outside of a few circumstances. We have better sleep aids, and seizure drugs now. They were abused more than they were properly used in my opinion. One problem with benzos is that when tolerance builds up you cannot just keep raising the dose like you can with opiates. There is a ceiling above which benzos should not be prescribed due to an increase in side effects and no improvement in symptoms. With opiates the only real problem that seems to continue with slow titration upwards is constipation, and you can take laxatives for that. They are a different class of drugs from opiates. I personally think from my own experiences, that taking benzos and opiates together is like playing Russian roulette. How will you know if the dose of morphine is too high to be safe with the valium? Do you wait for something terrible to happen to you? I don<APO>t know. I won<APO>t do it, if you want to that is your choice. You an educated woman and with your doctor you will decide what is best for you. This is one of those things that we can just disagree about. Everyone gets to make their own informed decision about these things. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I didn<APO>t address part of your post. Most research I have read over the years uses a 50% factor for cross tolerance when changing opiates for chronic pain. Then the doctor adjusts the dose upwards very slowly to curb ones pain without depressing their respiratory drive too much. One particular article was talking about long acting opiates specifically, but I would think as long as you add up all the opiates (long and short acting) that you are taking in a day (24 hours) you can still figure it out. I don<APO>t think you have developed tolerance, I think you just need more opiate for your pain level. Pain levels vary from time to time. Take care, Annette""0% for a cross tolerance factor during a switch to a new opiate could cause one to stop breathing. Yikes!! I am so glad research was done on these things before I changed over. You would be surprised how many people using the internet for these things overlook the tolerance factor when figuring out what their own dose perhaps should be. The first time I took a benzo, valium, was back in 1970, I was just out of nursing school, and a divorce that was very traumatic for me, and couldn<APO>t sleep because of nightmares that I was going to die. So, being young and dumb, I decided to just not to sleep. Obviously, it worked, no more nightmares, lol. However, I looked like death and a doctor where I worked asked me what was going on, I told him, and he RX<APO>d me 30 valium to help me sleep better. In those days it was valium or barbs that were used for sleep most of the time. Valium was THE most prescribed drug in the world back then. I took one before bed as instructed and got high as a kite, very pleasant, for about 20 minutes, then went to sleep. This time I dreamed I did die!! This happened three nights in a row, I put it together and flushed them down the toilet. Decades later, my pcp gave me klonopin (also a benzo) 0.25 mg. at bedtime for migraine prevention. They were using many of the anti-seizure meds for that back then. He had me titrate it up slowly to 1 mg. per bedtime. I was only on it for three or four months. Many bad things happened to my personality, and I also lost my memory of that three months forever (so far, it<APO>s been 15 years). I was finally in a serious one car accident avoiding a rabbit in the road near my house at 1 pm, no meds at all since bedtime the night before. I called my doctor from the ER and stopped my klonopin. I went into withdrawals and he had to give me meds for that. Fortunately, I knew what they were right away and called him. One should NEVER, EVER withdraw from benzos without medical supervision, one can have seizures and die. The half life of klonopin is about 50 hours, so I was one of the people that it just kept building up in my system as I took it every 24 hours or so. So, now I just do not take benzos. My current doctor thinks that is a good idea too. When I said what I did about taking opiates and valium together, I did not mean at the same hour, I meant not to let them be in your body at the same time. MS Contin is taken on a set schedule so it will always maintain a minimum level in your body to combat your pain. Valium has a fairly long half life, about 50 hours or so. Read the most recent literature and decide for yourself what to do. Talk to your doctor about all these med related things. If he blows you off, find a good pharmacist that you trust to be your friend and advocate. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know about the 50% thing, I have not read anything new about morphine lately. If that is true, then you are only getting 7.5 mg upon taking it orally. Morphine is not well absorbed orally like it is IV and we used to give opiate naive patients 5-10 mg IV. My handbook for advanced practice nursing gives the 50 hour half life info regarding valium. I looked it up yesterday to make sure. It can vary somewhat from patient to patient. I am sure you can find something on line about the proper way to taper off of valium, but I would just discuss it with your doctor or pharmacist. The taper may vary somewhat depending on how long one is on it, and what other meds one is on. Compare what he says with what you read and figure it out for yourself. I have always found a good pharmacist is worth millions!!! Take care, Annette""It depends on what else you are taking, and what kind of anti-anxiety meds you are talking about. Anti-anxiety meds do not change the stress you are under, whatever is causing the stress will still be there. Learn how to better respond to stressful situations. If you are having pain from headaches or whatever, treat the pain the best way you can and change how you respond to stress in general. Take care, Annette""We weren<APO>t communicating very well, I<APO>m sorry. I was talking about the 50% number that you gave me when you said 50% was put into your system when you first took the MS Contin, and then the rest was released later. I meant that ""upon taking it"" as that first 50% that you said was released into your system. ""Upon taking it"" as when you took it or immediately after, not that the other 50% simply was not absorbed. The doses for oral morphine and IV morphine are different and are figured out ahead of time, we patients do not have to worry about that. I don<APO>t know what year you were in labor and the nurse wouldn<APO>t give you more morphine, but you have to remember that they are treating two patients when they give drugs to women in labor. They consider that the baby may have depressed respirations due to morphine that they gave mom during labor. When I had my son, I did not have any morphine during labor. Where I worked in labor and delivery back in the 1970s, we rarely gave any kind of opiates to laboring moms, epidurals were also very uncommon. Most of us had our babies naturally with out drugs, unless there was some kind of complication. I don<APO>t know what is going on with you when you miss a dose at work, but what I would suggest is that you carry one dose of percocet and the dose of MS Contin with you on your body, and take one of them with a swallow of water if you are held up and start to feel pain. Business meetings seem to always keep water or coffee on hand for everyone. Or bring your own small bottle of water in your bag. You can be so discrete that no one will every know you took a pill. I personally believe it is fine, and my doctor is fine with me taking my long acting opioid up to an hour before or after the scheduled dose, so if you are going into a situation where you know you won<APO>t get done in time, take your pill a bit early?? Discuss this with your doctor of course. We learn a lot over 6 years, so don<APO>t beat yourself up when you did your reading back when valium was first prescribed to you. I do try and keep up on drugs and the new stuff we learn s time goes on, but that is a professional thing. I would never, ever suggest to anyone to stop taking a benzo without discussing a taper with their own doctor. You should never just stop taking it. Morphine is a blood vessel dilator, but it dilates ALL the blood vessels in the body too, not just the ones in the head, so what you posted confuses me about why it might cause headaches. It is given IV for headaches in the ER. It does not cause blood to rush to the brain, on the contrary it tends more to suck blood down into the body<APO>s vasculature as the body<APO>s blood vessels dilate, and leaves some folks dizzy because of that. Unless of course, the person getting it is flat on their backs, almost never happens. That is why it lowers your blood pressure. Think of the same volume of water being pushed through a large bore hose and a narrower one in the same amount of time. You will have a higher pressure coming out of the narrower hose, simple physics. Think of your blood vessels as the hose and your blood as the water. It your heart, the pump, pushes the blood through your blood vessels while they are narrower, your blood pressure is higher, but when the morphine dilates your vessels, they become a wider bore hose, and the pressure of the blood goes down, thus lower blood pressure. I married a big truck mechanic who has hydraulic and electronics experience and we were always able to understand each others work stuff, because the human body is basically a very fancy machine. The compensatory systems of the body would make him stop and think, but he always figured it out. Take care, Annette""Sorry, your explanation of systolic and diastolic isn<APO>t quite right. The systolic pressure is the higher number, and represents the pressure that happens when the heart is actually beating and pushing the blood through the blood vessels. The diastolic number is the lower number, and represents the pressure between beats, when the heart itself is at rest. We used to think that the diastolic pressure was the more important number, but with more recent research we know that both numbers are equally important in watching blood pressure and preventing related disease. Nowadays, a blood pressure of 140/90 is the maximum acceptable and anything higher than that (either number) should be treated by the doctor, either with lifestyle changes or with medicine if that doesn<APO>t work. I can remember when patients with a blood pressure of 150/100 was acceptable, we were just glad it wasn<APO>t 200/110, now we know that causes problems down the road. Now we aim for a blood pressure of less than 120/70 as the optimal numbers. Times have changed. Let your doctor know about the transitory headaches and dizzy spells, they may or may not be related to your meds. Sometimes inner ear problems cause dizziness. I was pregnant during my hippy days, lol, I stopped taking any drugs, except tylenol as needed, which I didn<APO>t take. No alcohol, no caffeine, etc. That was before the days of decaffeinated everything, lol. I even gave up Pepsi. I was so glad to deliver that child and go back to my bad habits. Natural childbirth was the thing to do, all the Lamaze classes pushed it on the west coast where I lived. No epidurals in those days. I worked OB for a year back then, the doctors mostly did local blocks, the occasional spinal or caudal block. I pushed for 12 hours without meds, then the doc did a caudal block because my son was turned around the wrong way, they used high forceps to turn him over, and pop, out he came. Fat and sassy. A happy ending. Now he is 33 and has a wife and kids of his own. Sorry, I went far into the past. Take care, Annette""Of course she would be unable to write RXs herself. I personally will not take Soma, I had a bad reaction to it, and they are very common with this drug. Have you tried any other muscle relaxants? I have had chronic headaches for many years, I would treat those with a headache specific medicine. I would avoid any kind of pain meds, even tramadol more than three days in a week, to avoid rebound headaches. Maybe there is a headache specialist or headache clinic near you where you could be evaluated. If you feel anxiety is a real problem and you cannot manage it on your own, I would see a psychologist first, then a psychiatrist if necessary for meds. Take care, Annette""The half life of a medicine is how long it takes your body to get rid of half the drug you took. The shorter the half life the faster your body removes the drug from your system. There are pros and cons for both long and short half lives. Take care, Annette""I would go with the neurologist who suggested verapamil for your headaches. I had terrible headaches for many years, I went through one medicine after another for a preventative. I am sorry but your biofeedback therapist has no business suggesting meds in my humble opinion, unless she has a MD behind her name or is also a pharmacist. I would suggest cognitive behavioural therapy for stress and anxiety/depression. I feel it is good for any kind of mood disorder. I used a book my therapist suggested to me, called ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns, MD. You can order it in soft cover at any book store. Another good book for self help is called ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"" by Dr. Margaret A. Caudill, MD, PhD. Both books have forms in them that you can copy and use to track how you are doing. I do not believe in anti-anxiety meds as a first line treatment for anxiety. There are too many side effects, some dangerous. The benzos are frequently prescribed and I feel they can be as dangerous as they are beneficial. We cannot avoid stress in our lives, we can only control how we react to it. You sound like you can do that without drugs, give it a try. Discuss all this with your doctor of course. Take care, Annette""I won<APO>t take them, sorry. I also would not see a pain management doctor for anti-anxiety meds, see a psychiatrist if you feel this is that important. There are many meds that help with headaches, I rotated through a bunch of the standard ones. I have ended up on neurontin for FMS pain and it also decreased the frequency and severity of my headaches. Pain management doctors do not always have training in managing headaches, so look for a specialist. I went all the way from Reno, NV to San Francisco, CA to see a headache specialist about my headaches at UC-SF Medical Center. He was very helpful and sent my doctor back home a report on his suggestions. Take care, Annette""Go to your doctor and get it examined. No one here can make a diagnosis of what the problem might be. Meanwhile keep it elevated higher than your heart if there is any swelling at all. Take care, Annette""Discuss with your doctor about your pain meds, some rotate the med to a different one, some up the dose. I don<APO>t think it really matters, what matters is your pain being controlled. Don<APO>t borrow meds from others, ever. Maybe changing your antidepressant will help too, I don<APO>t think there is any to know for sure until you try it. Congrats on getting that first pill down, that is always the hardest one. It will get easier. Actually, my husband and I agree that it is easier to swallow big pills like vitamins, than little ones. I think they give your throat something more to grab hold of. Let me know what you think when you try more different sizes. Take care, Annette""It is short for fibromyalgia, you can read all about it at http://www.myalgia.com. Pain and a lack of restorative sleep are the two main symptoms, but it is far more complicated than just that. Take care, Annette""Go read at the link I provided, before reading the rest of these posts, lol. If you have anything, you should read all about it, and learn as much as your doctors or more. Take care, Annette""I would just not worry about the diagnosis for now and treat whatever symptoms you have. My doctor did that for me many years ago, it was the best thing we ever did. I took small amounts of opiates for pain and ambien for sleep, because pain and a lack of sleep were my main problems. Later they diagnosed me with FMS, all the doctors have agreed on that, but it took about a year. Take care, Annette""There is no predicting how you would end up. People who have adhesions often get them again from the scar tissue after the surgery to clean out the adhesions. I would see at least two different surgeons and tell the second one he is just a consult for a second opinion, so he doesn<APO>t have any financial conflicts of interest. Then you just have to make the decision with the best info you can get. Take care, Annette""Gail covered most of what I might have said, so no sense repeating it. I would ask her if you might drive her to an appt. with her primary care doctor and go into the exam room with her. Let her know how concerned you are and how much you miss the ""old Mom"" that you remember. Voice your concerns to the pcp and ask him if he can review her meds. Take ALL the medicines she has in their original bottles with you. Sometimes when you have many specialists taking care of a patient the various meds they prescribe are too much or interact with each other badly. After you rule out the meds, then your mom and you and the doctor have to decide what is the next step to take. She is lucky to have you to care about her and for her now, while she is having such a difficult time of it. Take care, Annette""The rules only say that the ER doctor has to assess pain and offer treatment. He does not have to give one opiates. There are no rules about what kind of treatment he must offer. As long as he tells you to take tylenol or ibuprofen, or sit in hot water or ice the area, they are covered. He is also fine with telling the person to see their PCP as needed for followup. This person does not have acute pain, he has chronic pain with a flare up. It is totally different. If you lie to the doctor, you may not get good care. I agree that no one should be treated this way. However, we all have to take some responsibility for our own care, that means getting enough RX meds to cover this kind of thing. I would be angry with the person<APO>s PCP not the ER doctor, The PCP knows this person and has the ability to write a RX that would tide this person over until he sees his new doctor. By the way, his new doctor is also under no obligation to prescribe opiates. The whole thing is very frustrating and something we all are afraid of. Take care, Annette""I never said I don<APO>t agree with you on the entire matter, just the legal implications for the hospital about pain treatment, and that for me, being a witch about stuff wouldn<APO>t work, better for me to be nice to the doctor. I am not sure what medication you are talking about that will offer pain relief but no ""high"" that are given IV. No one has ever stuck a needle in my IV line or heparin lock without telling me what was in it! They have always said this is morphine, or compazine, or whatever. Doctors and nurses do not practice like that where I have lived. We obviously come from different experiences and geographical areas. So, we have different opinions on how to handle certain situations. Take care, Annette""I agree with you that we have a long way to go to get good health care to everyone. I just wanted to clear the air about what the law demands and what it doesn<APO>t. The rules only say that pain must be assessed and treated, not by what means. I have read many posts that implied that the doctors were required to prescribe opiates to folks who had been on them in the past or who felt they needed them. It simply is not true. There is no medical proof that you are having back pain or a migraine requiring opiate treatment. MRIs showing all kinds of changes do not mean you are having pain. It is a judgment call for the doctor, you would not believe how many drug abusers show up with all kinds of papers that you cannot check out because it is after five in the afternoon or on a week end. Working in the ER is a constant battle of figuring out who is an addict and who has legitimate pain. I am SO GLAD I was only a nurse, and not the doctor who had to make that decision. if everyone was just honest it would help a lot. I would far rather an addict just tell me he can<APO>t get a fix and needs a few pills to get by. But, our system does not allow for that. I have been to many ERs in my life for migraines, I have only been treated in a questionable manner one time, the first and only time I was out of town and had a migraine. The doctor just told me he would ""write for whatever I wanted"" and turned around and walked out. I had not had but one or two headaches at that point, and only really wanted reassurance that I wasn<APO>t having a stroke or something. Oh well... he was having a bad day. The nurse took good care of me. I don<APO>t approach a doctor like I want a confrontation, this has worked for me. You are welcome to try what you want. Take care, Annette""Folks vote for all the war on drugs crap like extending jail/prison sentencing, etc. instead of providing more treatment options for addiction. Just thinking out loud... Take care, Annette""No drug is completely safe under all circumstances. They all can have side effects. That is why it is best to discuss these things with your doctor. My neurologist told me that taking any one medicine more than three days per week put you at risk of developing rebound headaches, that scares me more than liver damage does, lol. Tylenol only causes liver damage in most people if taken too often or too much at any one dose. Taking different products that all contain tylenol can cause problems because of this. Discuss this with your doctor. He knows your body and medical history far better than we do. Read all about migraines and headaches on reputable medical sites to learn as much as you can to take care of yourself. Take care, Annette""Yes! When I have a migraine, and I am vomiting in the toilet, nothing matters more than getting rid of it. To think of having a rebound headache for weeks on end is scarier to me than liver failure that may or may not happen. After a concussion in a motor vehicle accident I had daily headaches for several weeks, it was horrible. I haven<APO>t bought or used a tylenol since my son moved out many years ago because they never helped me with anything, pain or fever. I have cared for teenagers who took an entire bottle of tylenol and went into liver failure. However, I took 800 mg. of ibuprofen 4-5 times a day for a couple of years for nerve pain from my neck down my arm. It didn<APO>t kill my stomach or my kidneys, I might have just been lucky. I don<APO>t recommend that for anyone. My doctor was watching me closely, but it still wasn<APO>t necessarily a good thing to do. That is why I try to tell everyone to discuss their care with their own MD. I never claimed that all my own behaviour is rooted in scientific knowledge or makes sense, we all have our own quirks. I made chocolate hip cookies every other day for seven months while my son was a Marine in Iraq because I just knew if I did so, he would come home safely. That was about six years ago, I didn<APO>t tell anyone except my husband for about three years after he got home. One very good friend said, ""Well he came home safely, so who knows?"" The guys that my husband worked with just wanted to know why I stopped making them cookies, lol. Take care, Annette""NeNe is right, I was only talking about rescue drugs. I have used many preventative drugs also. My neurologists all told me that if you get more than about three headaches a month you should try preventative drugs. Take care, Annette""I was lucky because since tylenol never worked for me anyway, I never had to make that decision between taking too many of them or having rebound headaches. I was lucky to have the sweetheart doctor that I had back then, he was wonderful. Now, my headaches are under better control than back then. I did okay for the first two deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq during the invasions, it was the third time that messed me up. I am so glad that is over for our family, I only hope that it will be over soon for everyone. So many deaths and injuries. I<APO>m lucky, my husband does most of the cooking at our house, he is a far better cook than I am!!! Take care, Annette""For info about Fibromyalgia, go read at http://www.myalgia.com . There is lots of good info there. Take care, Annette""Talk to your doctor. Most PT places will get you set up on TENS unit and teach you how to use it. That way you know if it works for you before you buy one. I don<APO>t think it would replace Xanax though. You will find out when you try one. Have you found any research to support that kind of use? Please post a link if you have, it would be interesting to read. I have one and use it occasionally for skeletal pain. It does help some. Take care, Annette""What I understood jmorr to say was that the insurance was crappy and he/she opted not to take it. I don<APO>t know from that post if he could afford it or not. I am a nurse, and I have always believed that in the USA, decent, basic health care should be a right for all of our citizens, just like a K-12 education is. I believe that if we had universal health care and taxed appropriately to pay for it, then we could all be covered. I would not mind paying higher taxes for that. Every other first world country manages to do that much. The USA is not even in the running when it comes to markers like maternal/child death rates, age expectations, etc. for good quality health care. We don<APO>t cover hypertension, or diabetes like we should because many people never see a doctor to get basic stuff done, so instead those people have heart attacks and strokes and we pay the big bucks for hospital care. It is humiliating for most people to come to a free clinic, they wait for hours to see a doctor, the waiting room is hot, and the chairs are hard. Few people in my experience are willing to do that to save twenty bucks on a copay. If Medicaid/Medicare were expanded to cover everyone, and taxes were collected from the healthy as well as the sick like they should be to pay for it and you eliminate the middle man, maybe it would be cheaper, I don<APO>t know. I am not an economist, just a nurse. There are lots of reasons why health insurance is so expensive, my problem is not the deadbeat patients, but the insurance companies themselves who want to make more $$ to pass it along to their shareholders. No one should be making $$ off of someones illness except the doctor/hospital/? who cares for them. Regular doctors, nurses, and specialists are free to volunteer their time and facilities however they wish. In all the nine years I worked at the free clinic volunteering my time, I could probably count on one hand the number of freeloaders that showed up there. All the doctors, medical students, interpreters, and nurses (over 250 per year) who volunteered their time were happy to do so, and were not coerced in any way. I don<APO>t think anyone has the right to force you to donate your time, but no one has the right to tell me not to either. When you have the choices of paying for your own insurance, OR the roof over your head, OR food on the table for your kids, I feel the insurance would be the first to go. It would for me, although we managed to cover insurance until we were both eligible for Medicare. In this country, no one should have to even make that choice. Just my opinion. Take care, Annette""Trust me, I have seen folks who were well kept, had makeup on, and nice clothes and just wanted drugs to get high, and came to the ER to get them. There really is no absolutely sure way of telling who is who. Even street living, run down, dingy, drug addicts sometimes have health problems that require an opiate. It would be nice if there was a monitor or a blood test that confirmed the diagnosis of pain. It is just sad that doctors even have to use the boogey man (DEA) excuse with patients to avoid the question of using opiates at all. My personal experience is that they just do not want to deal with drug abusers, and the reputation of being a doctor who treats pain with opiates gets around quickly on the street. One ER I worked in had that reputation, because the doctors took the patient<APO>s word for it if they had pain (unless they were just too obvious for words). We opted to err on the side of treating a person with pain rather than sending them away. It is very subjective, like you said. I also enjoy real discussions here, we don<APO>t have to always agree on everything, we all have our own set of experiences, but we can talk about things civilly. Take care, Annette""Like I said, we kept up on our insurance until we qualified for medicare. I would not abuse the system, but I will fight and vote to change it. Obama<APO>s plan sucks in my opinion, because he is willing to push people onto insurance companies. Have you actually paid the 20% of 2 million dollars? Do they charge you interest? That is crazy... Our insurance had a yearly limit, so they would not have paid for all of that anyway. It would have been on us to pay for all of it after 1 million dollars, the 20% would only apply for the first million per year. Health care costs so much nowadays, if you are in a serious accident you can eat up that first million fast. That is one thing Obama got right, no more annual limits on insurance. My parents did not have medical insurance when my dad got lung cancer and died 9 months later. My mom paid each medical person she owed $5-10 a month, when she paid one person off she added that amount to the next person in line. It took her nearly until she was retired to pay off all that debt. Dad died when both of them were 45 years old. She retired at 65. She did what she thought was right. Nowadays, hospitals and doctors turn their patients over to collection agencies. I was told by a hospital 2 years ago that if I could pay off our copays/coinsurance in two years on a payment plan and never missed a payment they would not turn us over to collections for my husband<APO>s hip replacement. We paid about $5,000 ourselves. Cash and credit cards. It was the only way he could keep working so we would have health insurance. Most communities have a variety of free/low cost clinics available. We have a county primary care clinic that sounds like it is run similarly to the one you describe. Paid staff. There is more than one free clinic (like the one where I volunteered) in the Portland, OR area, but they don<APO>t advertise. It took me over a year to find the one I did work at, there happened to be an article in the newspaper about them, so I called. We had patients on an advisory board that said we should charge something so people would not feel so terrible about coming, so we charged a $10 a visit voluntary donation, but made it clear it was not necessary to see a doctor if they did not have it. People who could, paid more, and some did not pay at all. Some came back when they were in a better place and gave us $$ or time as a volunteer. I am not yet of a mind that most people are out to get everything for free. People do dumb things sometimes, but it is often because they don<APO>t think it all through. I think skipping insurance until you think you might need it and then signing up for it is wrong, I think that is abusing the system. Insurance does not pay full price either, the companies bargain the price way down and contract with doctors and hospitals to pay those lower rates. Then the hospitals charge more to those who do not have insurance and are willing, like my mom was, to pay full price. We all pay in the end, either through raised hospital rates, or raised insurance fees. I would rather pay through taxes. Everyone feels differently about this topic. I think that is okay, perhaps we will all learn something from this discussion. Take care, Annette""Hi, We had our nearly first spring time sunny day to day. It is supposed to hit 70 for the first time, we will see. I hope your liability suit comes out your way soon. I would hate having all of that hanging over me. I was happy to pay off the last of my husband<APO>s hip replacement surgery, I can<APO>t imagine your situation. I can<APO>t imagine what happens to folks that have a stroke or a heart attack and have Life Flight and hospitals bills due. My friend<APO>s daughter had a very premature (26 weeks) baby whose care came to well over a million dollars by the time she had three surgeries and was in the NICU for months. Her parents weren<APO>t married and the hospital immediately signed her up for medicaid for the baby. The baby is six now and doing great. A cottage on the beach sounds great, my grandpa<APO>s second wife had a house at Stinson Beach in Calif. Not a great house, but it was fun. Hugs, Annette""Helicopter ambulance services are usually private companies. A few nurse friends of mine were flight nurses and ER nurses too. One RN friend was killed taking a patient to a trauma center, the copter crashed and everyone died, 5 people. I would have to be unconscious to get on one, lol. I am lucky my husband isn<APO>t a control freak, we make our own decisions about things, and discuss things but have never tried to control each other. He has never even looked in my purse or email acct. I doubt he would know how. I don<APO>t spy on him either. It is just the two of us, my son lives far away, as do his two girls. I love listening to the waves outside, what a joy that would be. Hugs, Annette""Please, please do not feel judged by me. I try not to ever judge anyone. I would not ask you what your particular financial/insurance situation was because it is none of my business. I am all about using free/low-cost/income-based clinics if you are ill, that is what they are for. We were having a lively discussion, as far as I am concerned, all hypotheticals. It just happened to be your post that got everyone going. I am very sorry if you feel dumped on or don<APO>t come back. Take care, Annette""I worked in a volunteer position as an RN twice a week for nine years at a free clinic. We offered care to anyone without insurance, we did not check financial records or ask if insurance was available where they worked. When I started working there 11 years ago, about 85% of our patients were unemployed, when I stopped a couple of years ago, it was about 85% employed, but didn<APO>t have insurance. Folks who are unemployed for awhile might get on medicaid in our state if they are legal residents. Most employers in our community do not offer affordable health insurance to all their workers, they say it is too expensive. $200 a month with a $1500 deductible may sound good to you, but if you are making minimum wage and supporting more than just yourself, that is very difficult to do. Lots of adults opt to cover their kids first when insurance is available. If you have SSDI or no income at all, it becomes impossible. We had to show we had paid out our deductible before our insurance kicked in for their share. If I had a spare $1500 to pay for MRIs, surgery, etc. I would be very lucky. Thank God for credit cards, and payment plans. When I started working as a nurse, I had a $50/year deductible, and never even used that up for many years. I was healthy and used Planned Parenthood for my yearly exams. When my husband retired last year, his health insurance had a $3,000 apiece deductible and horrendous premiums that we paid out of his check, over $400 a month. Now we are on Medicare works fine for us. My experience with specialists and other diagnostic workups done for folks using free clinics is that the specialists and radiology places offer pro bono or free appts. It is not paid for by taxes, but by donations from folks willing to give up some free time. The person who accepts this care is free to do what he wishes, I would hope that he would pay it forward by helping someone else. One free clinic in my community was in the news last year because they traded free medical care for volunteer hours by the patients. It would be nice if we all could afford insurance, but we can<APO>t. I would ask what do insurance companies really do to earn their keep and make money for their shareholders? They are middle men who provide no product or tangible service at all, in my opinion. I think we should get rid of all insurance companies myself. Billing should be clear in who is paying for what and how much. I just had surgery and it is not clear at all. Hospitals and insurance companies have secret contracts for a specific kind of surgery, no one will tell the patient anything, and I am an educated woman. Just my opinion, I believe in single payer, universal health care. Take care, Annette""I wish you the best of luck. Usually in free clinic settings, specialists volunteer their time, a certain number of hours per month. So don<APO>t just be grateful, volunteer some of your time somewhere and pay it forward. We can all do something. Starting treatment with tramadol is appropriate, let the doctor know if it isn<APO>t working and be open to trying whatever he suggests. As you try different things the two of you will learn to trust each other, and he may offer you stronger meds. It sounds like he is doing the right things so far. Take care, Annette""Hi, Kelly I have worked in the health care area for most of my life and the DEA never went after anyone I ever met. As long as a doctor does due diligence and documents his care properly, the DEA is not going to bother him. I went to the DEA<APO>s website and read about their enforcement and a very small percentage of doctors are ever investigated, let alone prosecuted. I also investigated the other side of the coin, by reading all about a doctor who was investigated, and how he ran his ""cash only"" office, he deserved to get whatever was coming to him. Just him, not every doctor. Some doctors don<APO>t want to deal with drug abusers constantly making appts. and hassling the doctors for drugs, so they say on the phone that they don<APO>t prescribe opiates or treat chronic pain. I don<APO>t believe it has much to do with the DEA. I have dealt with law enforcement in the ERs I have worked in and they always knew who was a ""soft touch"" for opiates and where to find him. These are the doctors who trust the patients to tell them the truth about their pain, and then prescribe accordingly. It can go either way, depending on whether the patient is telling the truth or not. Rather than demonize anyone, I try to be a good patient, keep my appts., fill my RXS, be honest with my doctors, etc. If I have a good relationship with my doctors, it is all good for all of us. I have had great doctors over the years. I can only think of one ER doc that might have been a bit testy when I went in for a migraine out of town. ALL my other doctors have managed my pain well, and not ever treated me like a drug addict. It is always good to hear your opinion on things. Take care, Annette""Please remember that Federal law is always against the use of marijuana and that it trumps all state ""medical marijuana"" laws. I live in a ""Medical Marijuana"" state, and tried it before OR was one, and it did not work. It, like all drugs, does not work for everyone, or all kinds of pain. Make your own choice, but I would keep it very secret. Take care, Annette""No worries. I live in OR, but I have read that in CA the feds are busting people for selling medical marijuana. I don<APO>t want to get caught up in all that. People should just be aware. I asked all my doctors at the time, and they all told me, ""everything in moderation"", but none were willing to actually tell me how much to use, or when, or anything else about it. One neurologist in Idaho answered his own phone and talked to me for about 20 minutes. I had gotten his name from an article he wrote about migraines and marijuana. He was far more helpful than my own doctors. Take care, Annette""The positions they used for your back x-rays were the ones they usually use. I have never heard of x-raying the spine with the patient laying on her stomach. Degenerative spinal disease as shown on x-rays or MRIs do not always coincide with where you feel pain. It is often the soft tissues that are painful. If he can<APO>t seem to get you comfortable, ask him if he can refer you to a neurologist for further testing and an examination. Take care, Annette""Discuss this with your doctor. He might be able to prescribe something to help with the rash under the patch, or he may be able to adjust the dose of your pain pills. There are lots of different roads to take to get you to the same place. Relief. Take care, Annette""What kind of nasal spray did the PA suggest? I have heard that a RX spray like Nasonex that contains a small amount of steroids works well for skin allergies to patches<APO> adhesives. That makes sense to me scientifically. However, lots of drugs come in nasal sprays nowadays, which one are you using? Take care, Annette""Ditto what they said, call your surgeon right away. I had neck surgery because I was dropping things all the time. My surgeon told me it was due to pressure on the nerve to my arm, he fixed that. Since you started that since your surgery, and are losing track of the days, and generally don<APO>t feel well, give his office a call and make an appt. or go to the ER if they won<APO>t fit you in right away. Take care, Annette""Do you have a link to the article you mentioned? I used a generic MS Contin for about ten years, and only changed the dose every 3-5 years.I don<APO>t know what they consider a low dose, did they say? I have never heard that tolerance is dose related. I don<APO>t even know if tolerance is a problem with you, perhaps you just need more medication to manage your pain, because your pain itself is worse. That, however, is all academic. I hope your doctor opts to treat your pain as you state it is, so that you can be more active in your life. My doctor, bless her heart, told me recently that no one should have to decrease their activities to control pain. She told me if I had more pain if I exercised longer, to let her know and she would adjust my meds. My only suggestion is to focus on your functional abilities not the pain itself when you talk to him, and treat it like it is high blood pressure and you need more treatment for that. Don<APO>t act all nervous and strange, it is pain and needs treatment, nothing more or less. You are not guilty of anything wrong. Take care, Annette""I am glad it went well, I suspected it would. You may well be able to decrease the amount of BT meds you take now that you are on a better level of MS Contin. Please just talk to your doctor like you would us or anyone else. Take care, Annette""Well said, Dr. A. I use many other tools in addition to my meds, I think they are so ingrained that I sometimes forget to mention them. Do you have any links to the research you mentioned on long term use of opiates, esp. side effects, and opioid induced hyperalgesia? Thanks again. Take care, Annette""Thanks for the link, I will go and read the article. Unfortunately what works on mice does not always work with humans. Mice are usually the first animals used for drug possibilities, they work up to humans. I started on 15 mg. same as you, went up to 30 mg. every 24 hours at bedtime within a couple of days, to every 12 hours a few months later (my choice, my doctor suggested every 12 hours from the beginning, but I felt I just needed better overnight coverage so I could sleep). I stayed there for 3-5 years, and then increased my total 24 hour dose by half or less every 3 years after that. My doctor was willing to double my dose each time, but I didn<APO>t want to do that unless I had to, she was happy to do it my way. So, I went from 30 mg. twice a day, to 30 mg. three times a day, to 60 mg. twice a day, to 60 mg. three times a day. Then I switched to methadone because it was cheaper, not for better relief. I used breakthrough meds at about the same level throughout this period. I am retired so I don<APO>t care so much about how many pills I take per day, it just doesn<APO>t matter that much to me. Anyhow, you have not even been titrated to the best dose for your pain yet, so I would save the worrying for later on. Easier said than done though, huh? Take care, Annette""Come on, Kelly! Last time you asked for a titration, he let you have it. It is safer to do smaller steps upwards, but you have to talk to him, and tell him exactly how long it lasts and what kind of relief you get. Think in your head that it is blood pressure medicine you are talking about, be matter of fact about it. After you got the last titration, you told me it turned out not to be a big deal after all, but you were scared to death that he would turn you down. No one will treat your pain more aggressively until you treat it like a part of your life that you just need to deal with, like everything else. Tell the doctor all the things you would like to do, but can<APO>t, because you have too much pain. Be very specific about what your goals are. When your doctor actually says NO, and refuses to write for a different med, dose or frequency, ask for a referral to someone else who might be able to manage your pain better so you can attain your goals. Doctors are just like the rest of us, they hate to admit defeat, maybe he will come up with something. If not, it is better to see someone else. I see my doctor more frequently around the times I have needed drug changes or dose changes, that is good medicine. Once we get to a stable place, I see her less frequently. I dare you to just tell him what you want as far as pain relief goes! Hugs, Annette""All doctors should be aware that the latest and best medical science shows that only the patient knows what level his pain is at currently. They should treat it appropriately. I feel that is why we should develop a relationship with our doctor so he knows we are trustworthy. We trust them, and they need to know they can trust us not to be drug seekers or abusers. That just comes with getting to know each other. Take care, Annette""Hi, Kelly Don<APO>t worry or even think about what happens to other people. If they seem to have no pain, or like Barius have had complications to opiate therapy. That isn<APO>t you! None of us know what may happen to us off int he future. Just deal with the present. I would personally not wait until I need a refill on another medicine to discuss with the doctor problems with the MS Contin, he might think it is not that big a deal if you can wait until you are seeing/talking to him for something else. That is just me though. I am unsure about the deal with the oxycodone, did it work for the first 15 minutes after you took it then stopped working, or did you have to wait a while for it to work, then 15 minutes after that, you got pain again? Were you pain free for that short time, or did your pain level just go down some? Don<APO>t feel bad about the fold up chairs, they make everyone<APO>s back hurt. I can<APO>t sit still for long without something hurting, I would not even sit down in one of those things. I know when you are in pain, everything feels worse and feels more hopeless too. I hope for you that your doctor adjusts your meds again, and quickly so you will feel better soon. If I could take your pain for just one day, I would. You need a break. Hugs, Annette""Hi, Kelly I would suggest you add some kind of exercise into your day, maybe start with just stretches, discuss this with your doctor first of course. The fact that you state you live a pretty sedentary lifestyle makes me think that perhaps your muscles are somewhat deconditioned, and that may be why you have increased pains when you do chores. Maybe talk to a PT about just strengthening your core muscles to start???? I take my breakthrough meds about a half an hour before I start mowing the yard or vacuuming, in addition to following a pretty strict exercise routine daily. It has really helped me a lot. But once my back hurts, I stop what I am doing completely. Do it another day. Pain is often your body telling you something is wrong. I feel that taking meds and going on with doing the same thing is counterproductive. For me anyway. Take care, Annette""I would agree with you about trying PT again, let them know what your goals are. That should include doing exercises at home on your own, so of course they should teach you how to do them right for your own condition. What I really like about belly dancing is that you can be as athletic as you like, or you can stand in one place and work on isolating your muscle groups, totally low impact. I don<APO>t do any kind of exercise machines anymore, I found they usually ended up as clothes hangers, lol. Been there, done that. All I need is a space on the floor about 6 ft. square. Anything more than that is gravy, lol. Take care, Annette""I read the abstract that your link sent me to regarding the ""low dose"" morphine in mice. They stated in the abstract that they used daily injections of 10 mg./kg. of morphine in these mice. I am totally unfamiliar with mouse doses of morphine, but this is not a ""low dose"" for a human adult. For the sake of easy math, say a 220 lb. (100 kg.) human was to get 10 mg./kg. of morphine, that would come out to 1,000 mg. of morphine. Please correct me if my calculation is inaccurate it has been a long time since I had to do this. The normal injection of morphine for acute pain in a non-tolerant adult human, contains about 5-10 mg. total, not 10 mg./kg. The abstract also was discussing the use of ""genetic or pharmacologic"" blockade of a particular neuropeptide in order to decrease opiate tolerance. The mice that took more than three weeks to develop tolerance had been ""treated"", the other mice developed tolerance within 10 days. Humans do not develop tolerance near that quickly. This may be one of those instances where mice and men are not even close to the same in how they react, I just don<APO>t know. It would be interesting to read the entire article not just the abstract. Also, to know how it was set up and who is paying the bills for the study. Thanks for the interesting link. Take care, Annette""Hi, Kelly You sound much more positive than you did when you first came here. I am glad things are working better for you. I have found over the years, that how I take my meds and use other techniques really affects my pain levels. I always take a hot shower or sit in the hot tub after strenuous activities, I find that it helps whatever meds I am taking to deal with stiffness and pain. I bet over time you will incorporate many things and find the best ones for you. Things that do not work seem to go by the wayside. I don<APO>t mind the pain after I accomplish something, it is when I have pain after not doing anything that I get angry. That is FMS for you though, you cannot always figure out why you hurt. See if your TV system gets a program called ""Shimmy"", I get it on the Fitness Channel. It is a basic belly dance intructional program. You might try it. It usually consists of several moves, 3-4, that are done in easy repetitions. Each program only lasts 30 minutes with commercial breaks. They include yoga type warm up and stretches to start out, then instruction and practice, then they use the moves in a very short choreography with music. Always warm up first. Talk to your doctor about any new fitness routine. That is how I got started. Take care, Annette""I am so glad you are feeling better!!!! I know once I got my pain meds in order, I could do more (including exercise), and that made me happier. Hugs, Annette""I am so glad that you are doing so much better. I do not clean my home all at once any more, it isn<APO>t worth it. I clean in shorter bursts, of an hour or so. It is amazing how much you can get done in an hour if you pay attention. Then I rest for 30 minutes or so, then go on. I rarely do more than a couple of rooms a day. The one exception to doing chores in short bursts is yard work, I work at that until our yard debris container is full, then stop for the day. It is only picked up once a week, so that chore has become self-limiting. If I have to take more drugs after the first BT dose, I stop working altogether. With time you will find the best way to do these things for yourself. Take care, Annette""What part of the doctor<APO>s post was unrealistic for you? What kinds of things do you do to help control your pain? My husband and I were talking about the use of the word ""suffering"". I don<APO>t call my pain ""suffering"", I personally feel that ""suffering"" is more of an emotional response to pain, than a physical response. I am not sure I made myself clear to my husband or to the group here. Sorry... The word ""suffering"" is not one I use relating to me or my pain. Take care, Annette""Hi, Bet You said it far better than I. But the feelings are the same. I just refuse to ""suffer"" just because I have pain. Hugs, Annette""No reason at all to apologize. We all feel things differently. I have come to realize that words have great power, and so I pick them very carefully these days. I choose how I react to pain, I choose not to suffer. That does not mean everyone else has to choose the same thing as me. It is just something to think about. Take care, Annette""Thanks so much. It is very kind of you to take the time to write something so nice. Take care, Annette""Although there is technically no ceiling for opiate dosing, most doctors have their own limits as far as what they are willing to prescribe. When I took morphine at night, my pain was okay during the day if I slept well and took some vicodin type meds in the daytime. I was so afraid of being sedated and losing memory of things after my experience with benzos that I was very cautious. I use all the different things I have tried that give me even a bit of relief along with the opioids and other drugs. The cumulative effect is worthwhile. I want to keep my opioid dose as low as possible for as long as possible, or even get off of them someday. I cut my dose of methadone in half slowly after my breast reduction surgery, and decreased my BT pain meds also. No withdrawal symptoms at all. I only take 15 mg. of methadone per day now, 5 mg. three times a day. Take care, Annette PS, Let me know how the phone appt. with your doctor goes.""No one can diagnose you on the internet. Go see your doctor and let him examine you properly. Take care, Annette""Ibuprofen works better than any other over the counter med for dental pain, but follow the limits written on the bottle until you see a dentist. My husband used clove oil in those little dental first aid kits when he had a broken tooth, it worked for him, but still it is only until you can get to a dentist. Look around for a dental school or a dentist that is willing to barter or work out a payment plan. Call all the numbers you can find for free/low cost medical clinics, they usually know where you can find whatever dental care is available in your community. If nothing else, their doctors might be able to give you antibiotics for any infection you might have. Most dentists want that cleared up before they do their thing. Free dental work is very hard to find, even in my community where free medical care is pretty available. There is nothing to do to fix this problem permanently except see a dentist, so start figuring that out. Take care, Annette""No one can diagnose you online. The longer you wait the more you risk serious complications. That is up to you though. Go see your doctor. Take care, Annette""Methadone is a long acting opiate, it is just a naturally long acting one, rather than being in a special delivery type of pill. Don<APO>t reach out to take the scripts, ask him to please sit down, when he does, just repeat to him that the meds are no longer working for you and you need something adjusted. Are you taking any antidepressants, muscle relaxants, or antiseizure meds? Any of these may augment your opiates enough so you don<APO>t have to increase that dose yet. You may have already tried these, you didn<APO>t say. Excuse me if you have. Sometimes you just have to be very assertive with doctors. Take care, Annette""Hi, Jackie You mentioned that you stress every month wondering if they are going to give it to you or not. Have they ever NOT given it to you? If they always end up giving it to you, stop worrying about it, easier said than done, I know. If you always take it as prescribed and are only using two tablets a day, I would start saving up as many as you can so you have a bit of a stash going to tide you over, then start looking for another doctor who will not hassle you. Interview doctors just as you would plumbers or lawyers, or any other employee. Most doctors will tell you they will not treat chronic pain, they have always told me that. But, once we got to know each other, they always have. So, look instead for someone you feel comfortable with. You don<APO>t even have to tell your present doctors that you are looking around. Ask their office to send a copy of your records to you for now. Take these with you to show the new doctors. Take care, Annette""The other option you have, depending on your insurance is to follow your old doctor to his new place of business. I was seeing a doctor that I liked at a practice a few blocks from my home, and she left and moved about 30 miles away and set up her own practice. I went with her, it was worth it to me to hit the freeway and go down there to see her. Now, she gave up her solo practice and joined a clinic down there, I followed her there too. I am fairly healthy so I rarely see her except for pain management. Did your old doctor move out of state or so far away you aren<APO>t willing to follow him? Take care, Annette""One reason I would not have Kaiser if given a choice. My mom had Kaiser and she was fine with her doctors, but I am really attached to mine and would hate changing again. Most of the doctors where I live here in Oregon will take a multitude of insurance plans, so it hasn<APO>t come up for me. I have changed insurance plans three times since I have been with her, and she has changed practices twice now. As far as getting refills for RXs, I would never call less than one week ahead of time. I like to give them plenty of time, then they can<APO>t ever blame me for calling at the last minute. I see my doctor about every 2-3 months and always remind her of what RXs I need to have in hand, the CII ones, and which ones I need her to called in. I also take care of my husband<APO>s meds and he has a different doctor. As long as I don<APO>t fill them too close together my insurance company doesn<APO>t care. So far this has worked for me. Take care, Annette""Glad you are here, I am an old nurse, disabled since the late 1990s. I worked in ERs, ICUs, OB, Medical Floor, as the house supervisor, just about everywhere except the OR and RR doing real hands on nursing. Start volunteering as soon as you can. Even an hour once a week doing something useful will change that self esteem. We can all do something for someone else. Even home bound folk can call on the phone and check on other home bound folk. Start a chain of folks who call and check on each other once a day. I volunteered at a free clinic as a nurse for nine years, twice a week. Now I volunteer at the local animal shelter once a week. Take classes, anything to get you out of the house and meeting people. I keep up my license in Calif. because I can do distance learning and only need 30 hours every two years. Here in Oregon you have to work or volunteer an average of 4-5 hours a week, that got to be too much for me. I let that license go, but kept the one in Calif. I probably won<APO>t ever work as a nurse again, but you never know??? My son lives in Calif. with his family, maybe we will move and I will improve enough to work again in some capacity. It really hurts to give up nursing, I became very suicidal when I stopped working. But I couldn<APO>t find a day to kill myself that didn<APO>t fall near a holiday or someone<APO>s birthday. It is a lousy gift. I got a book called, ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns, MD. It turned my life around. I am happy and life is good. Give yourself a day or two to mope around then get on with your life. See a therapist if need be. Take care, Annette PS, I would change the name you use first off, you are not a victim unless you decide to be one.""Hi, Denise Change all those ""we(s)"" to ""I(s)"". I also have fibro and I love life and I am pretty darn happy. Hope you feel better soon. Take care, Annette""All large bruises can cause one pain for quite awhile. I had one on my upper arm from running into something, and it didn<APO>t stop hurting for weeks. Remember that a bruise is simply blood that pools where you injured yourself. As long as the blood is still there it can put pressure on the structures and cause pain. Blood outside of the blood vessels in the tissues can also cause pain and swelling. What I did was really stop doing those things that caused pain, until the discoloration and swelling were nearly gone. Then I SLOWLY returned to full activity. It may have been a full 6 weeks before I had full range of motion and no pain at all. See your doctor and let him examine you. We can<APO>t see anything on line and could not diagnose you anyway. Elbows are very tricky joints, and there are not good replacements for the two that you have. Take good care of them. Take care, Annette""I am a believer in cognitive behavioral therapy. I think it is good for most things in my life. It helps one learn how to react to the stressful things in ones life. I wish I had answers for your husband, but I don<APO>t. I would not do anything that requires surgery, without trying CBT first. Take care, Annette""I agree. My husband had non-Hodgkin<APO>s lymphoma, Stage IV when I met him 22 years ago. He had been given six months to live by all of his doctors if he stopped the treatments he was getting at the time. He decided to stop anyway, because he was so miserable from side effects. After a few months passed and he didn<APO>t get any worse, he decided to get a job. He magically got well, no one can explain why. His birthday is Sunday, he will be 67. I know he will die of something some day, but I am no longer watching him breathe at night. Life is good. He finally retired last year. We will all die of something, some day, I am not going to worry about it. Take care, Annette""Numbness is usually a nerve problem not a bone problem. I would see a neurologist and ask if there is anything that can be done. Take care, Annette""Where is your AVN? My husband had that in his femoral head, it collapsed completely by the time he was even diagnosed. He eventually had a hip replacement, and his pain levels went way down immediately. He used to race dirt bikes (motorcycles), rock climb, etc. Not anymore though, lol He has broken many bones over the years, and the places where they have healed all hurt now. Now he uses music and cooking to take up where the more strenuous activities left off. He finally retired last year, he will be 67 this Sunday. When you say you can<APO>t walk due to pain, do you mean if your house was burning down, you would burn with it, or would you make a run for it? If it hurts to move, but you still can move, that is one thing, but if you simply cannot move, that is another. Use your upper body as much as possible to maintain strength there. See a PT or OT, or both, to assess your lower body and try out whatever they suggest to get more mobility. Use whatever drugs you need, but stay mobile at all costs. Take care, Annette""Mid cycle pain where you say it is happening is often connected to ovulation. Have any of your doctors mentioned this? Take care, Annette""I can only speak for the ERs where I have worked as a RN in Calif. and Nev. They did not call medical records and request the old surgical or hospital charts for patients even once in 20 years that I can think of. It simply isn<APO>t done on any kind of a regular basis. They are far to busy, and many medical records offices are closed on weekends and PM and night shifts. Then you have to call the house nursing supervisor and wait until she has time to go and search for it. This is a good reason for digital charts, perhaps there would be a way for ER doctors to access digital charts, I don<APO>t know, because not that many hospitals are using them yet. VA and some big city hospital systems are using them now. I would recommend speaking with your doctor about what he would like you to do in case of emergency. With a good plan in place, ER visits should be rare. I have a plan with my PM doctor for both my chronic pain and migraines and have not needed to visit the ER in over 15 years. My doctor will see me within 24 hours for urgent care Mon.-Fri. during her usual business hours. She keeps a couple of office visits open for these kinds of calls. Take care, Annette""I am so sorry that you are being treated this way. I would speak up and ask for relief, not for specific meds. Not even complete relief, just pain control so that I could do the daily things I need to do. I have never been treated the way you describe, I am 60 years old now, but it has never happened to me. You actually see a doctor every week, and never get any relief? Why would you keep going? Take care, Annette""The best site I have found for information about FMS is http://www.myalgia.com. It is not an interactive site, but has many good, and dependable articles by people who deal with this disorder all the time. If it sounds like what you have, print out the article that seems most appropriate and take it to your MD to discuss. Take care, Annette""It could be anything, go see your doctor and explain to him what is going on. If his response doesn<APO>t feel right to you, go see a rheumatologist that deals with FMS and get a proper diagnosis. I have FMS, I am lucky my doctor recognized it and diagnosed it fairly quickly. My favorite site for good medical info about FMS is http://www.myalgia.com . Read about it and if it feels like it fits your symptoms, print out the article and take it to your doctor with you to discuss. It is a reliable medical site with articles from professionals like rheumatologists and PhD prepared nurses. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I didn<APO>t realize when I wrote this that I had already replied. Take care, Annette""Do your homework and bring info to him/her if necessary. I am so lucky, my doctor likes to read stuff I bring her from reputable sites. Visible swelling is not usually part of FMS, often times things will feel tight and swollen but if it is visible it may well be something else or something that you have in addition to FMS. It is very possible to have FMS AND have arthritis or some other ailment. I am part of a large family, and I am the only one with FMS. I believe there is a genetic predisposition, but I don<APO>t think they have found an actual gene that is responsible for FMS. Is your appt. with your pcp or a specialist? Take care, Annette""Ditto what Charles said. My husband is a reserved and stoic man, he had AVN of his hip after a fall and I knew he was in pain as he cried out in his sleep whenever he turned over in bed. I finally complained to his doctor, that the pain scale they used did not work for my husband, and to please explore this further. He examined my husband<APO>s hip and he still acted like it did not hurt. I continued to complain, then they x-rayed his hip and discovered the AVN, the head of his femur had collapsed completely. It was not the doctor<APO>s fault if my husband said it did not hurt that much. I KNEW something was wrong, my spouse has learned to trust in this doctor and tells him the truth now. Please do the same. Take care, Annette""I will keep good thoughts for you on Monday. I hope all goes well. My experience with SSDIis that they want to know how your various medical issues keep you from functioning in the work place. I concentrated on that rather than on diagnoses. Take care, Annette""Congrats, I know how disturbing it can be to be in the middle of all that again. Take care, Annette""I take it also. I started out on 300 mg. a day in the evening, then increased it by 300 mg. once a week until I got up to 1800 mg. After my pain stabilized I dropped it down to 800 mg. where it is now. I adjusted the time so the sleepiness was at bedtime. I take it all at once because I don<APO>t want to feel sleepy all the time. My doc has a lot of patients taking it once a day for chronic pain and it seems to work for many of us. It did make me feel kind of drunk at fist, but now I have no side effects at all. I still take opiate pain meds, but I have been able to keep from escalating the doses of those meds by using the neurontin. Take care, Annette""If you have been at that dose for several weeks and it isn<APO>t helping, I would ask the doctor about tapering off and trying something else. You are at the maximum dose I think for pain management. At least according to my doctor. I take it at 800 mg. and I love it, but we are all different. It is not one of those meds where you take a pill and an hour or so later your pain goes away. I notice how well it works when I miss a dose for some reason and my pain level shoots up. I would only adjust/change one med at a time, so you know what might be causing any problems you have. Take care, Annette""Thanks, but due to problems I have had in the past, I do not email anyone I meet on line. I prefer to use this message board along with their moderators. This is not a fatigue board at all, although fatigue is a natural outcome of chronic pain. I had the breast reduction in January and am very pleased with my decrease in pain. Take care, Annette""I also take methadone, it was 10 mg. three times a day, decreased to 5 mg. three times a day now. It is long acting. I occasionally would forget a dose and other than increased pain, had no symptoms of withdrawal. I have never heard of someone having withdrawal symptoms that soon after lowering a dose. It does not make sense medically or chemically. But, every ones body is different, and it might have been withdrawals or it might have been something else. How much are you taking now, how many times per day? Go see your doctor that prescribed this medicine, and let him know what happened to you and ask him what to do. It is not something I would see a psychiatrist about, I would call the rheumy that prescribed it to you and make an appt. to see him. I personally do not believe in dealing with this kind of thing over the phone. I believe you will get better medical care in person than by phone. Tell the scheduling person that you think you had a reaction to the medicine change, I would not go farther than that on the phone. Take care, Annette""In my experience with folks taking methadone, fatigue and lethargy can be side effects of the drug. However, they can also be side effects of both depression and FMS. I have FMS, and I have found the fatigue worse to deal with than the pain at times. There is no reasonable treatment for the fatigue. Take care, Annette""Fatigue is worse than pain as far as I am concerned because I can treat the pain but not the fatigue. I won<APO>t take stimulants, as I think they are counterproductive as far as getting good quality sleep is concerned. I would disagree with the substance abuse council as far as your sudden illness being part of opiate withdrawal goes, but we are all entitled to our opinions, and the only ones that matter are yours and your doctor<APO>s. I have not read of any connection between taking oxycontin many years prior to taking methadone and having ""early withdrawals"", do you have links to any articles on this topic? I would love to read them. I am not trying to wean off of methadone, I had breast reduction surgery in January and decided to try taking less meds after I recovered. The surgery really reduced the amount of back/shoulder/neck pain I had, so why not reduce the amount of opiates? I actually had already done it by the time I saw my pcp 7 weeks post op. I decreased it by half within a month or so. I take it three times a day, and simply reduced one dose at a time from 10 mgs. to 5 mgs. about once a week. I use a BT med 2-3 times per day as needed. I adjusted that as necessary as I went along. When I am more active I hurt more, so I am free to take the BT meds as needed at least 4 hours apart. My doctor says no one should have to reduce their activity to control pain, so she is willing to treat the pain as needed. I hope you find the best treatment for you. We are all different. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t believe that FMS and CFIDS are the same disorder. They may be related, I don<APO>t know. I have FMS, but I do not have the criteria for CFIDS. Having chronic fatigue is completely different than having Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Having chronic fatigue means you are tired all the time. Many people have that for many different reasons. CFIDS includes fevers that FMS does not for one thing off the top of my head. Take care, Annette""My personal experience with migraines is that opiates do not work. They can cause rebound headaches as can most drugs if taken more than three days a week. This is according to all the pcps and neurologists I have been to over the years. It is also my own experience. Do a headache journal, including the times you take any meds and the time the headache starts and stops. also ALL the foods you eat/drink. Take the journal to a headache specialist and work with one doctor all the time. Mine told me that first you take one preventative at a time for at least 3-4 weeks, then you try another, and another, etc. When you have tried them all, one at a time, then you start doing the same thing over again, only you use two at a time from different families, like an antidepressant and a Ca channel blocker. He told me it can take a couple of years, but he always found two that would work together. He also told me that if I found a drug that worked and it gradually stopped working, to go off of it entirely for 6 weeks then start it up again, and 9 times out of 10 it will work again. I saw a headache specialist at UC-SF Medical Center. I lived in Reno, NV and flew down there for my appt. He did not cure anything, but it was worth it to me to talk with him. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I haven<APO>t lived in Reno for about 15-16 years. Talk to the nurses if you know any, they always know who the good doctors are. Take care, Annette""I have had sciatica after pain medicine injections in my butt for migraines. The ER nurse hit the nerve, wrong place and I knew it right away. My PCP gave me steroids orally for ten days, and then I took Ibuprofen for awhile longer. He had run into it a few times in the past. I don<APO>t blame the nurse, I am a nurse, I know that everyone has a slightly different anatomy, maybe my sciatic nerve is a bit lower/higher than ""normal"". It took some time, but it went away. I accepted it as a possible side effect of treatment. You might look up Piriformis Syndrome, that is what I thought off when I read the first part of your post regarding your original problem. The piriformis nerve goes through the buttocks and can be pinched and cause similar symptoms to what you described. Do a search on a good medical site and see what you can find. If it sounds familiar you might discuss it with your doctor. If you don<APO>t feel comfortable with injections, just say no! Take care, Annette""I doubt there is any research on this topic. I have personally not heard of any ill effects of using marijuana and NSAIDs together, that does not mean they don<APO>t exist, it just means I have not heard about it.. How many time has he had gout? Has he seen an MD for it? There are known dietary changes that can effect gout, and more specific drugs for its treatment. Take care, Annette""I would do a search on Medline or Medscape and see what you come up with. Because there are still federal laws against using marijuana for any reason, very little research has been done. Take care, Annette""It is legal in my state too, but the federal government still considers it illegal. You have to get a doctor to sign your medical marijuana card in Oregon but a very high percentage of cards had been signed by the same doctor here according to the local newspaper. He barely sees patients, you fill out a form and he signs off on the application. All of my doctors in Oregon said that ""anything in moderation is okay"", but none of them signed medical marijuana card applications. They flat out refused. This person seemed to want to know specifically from medical professionals what the possible interactions are. I don<APO>t think there are any, but maybe the good doctor will reply. Take care, Annette""Congratulations on having a new baby! Please call your OB or anesthetist and let him/her know what you are experiencing. You may need the blood patch repeated, I don<APO>t know. Make sure you are properly hydrated meanwhile. Take care, Annette""Best of luck to you.The headache will pass. Enjoy your two babies as long as you can. They grow up fast. Take care, Annette""I appreciate all the different things you have tried, and hope you continue to use whatever seems to help. The only comment I have is that the way you describe taking your pain meds is not the way that is backed up by medical research. Even back when I was in nursing school, the late 60s, we were taught that one should take their meds before the pain gets ""so bad I can<APO>t stand it anymore"". By that time the meds just will not work as well. It is far better to take the meds when your base level of pain starts to go up. By doing this you will get better control of the pain with less narcotic medication. I read medical research way back then that showed people would end up using less narcotic pain meds and get better relief if they took the meds when the pain first started escalating, rather than waiting until it got really bad. I understand why people do that, I used to do it back when I was still able to work. I would drive home after a shift in the ER in tears because my legs hurt so bad, then take a hot bath and my pain meds. When I finally stopped working, one of my nurse buddies commented that now she hoped now I would take my meds properly and get my pain under decent control. She was right. I might have been able to continue to work had I done that sooner. The pain med patches that contain fentanyl should only be used by folks who are already taking opiates on a daily basis. There are specific doses of narcotic meds that pass that requirement. Speak to your doctor, he can let you know if the fentanyl patches are appropriate for you. I have found that if I can get a small amount of pain relief from each of several treatments, the combined amount of relief is worthwhile. I hope you find the right combination of treatments for you. Take care, Annette""Go see a doctor and let him/her examine you thoroughly and do whatever tests are needed to make a proper diagnosis. Do not take anymore drugs until you talk to a doctor. Take care, Annette""Bless my husband, he is a keeper. When I first developed FMS and had not yet been diagnosed, he called his dear Auntie, and told her what I was going through. (He did not discuss this with me until years later, when she died.) She told him it was probably the beginning of the ""Change"" and that he ""should give me whatever I wanted as soon as possible."" He did that anyway, but kept on doing it. That was over 15 years ago. I was in my mid forties and did finally go through menopause at 53. That was no big deal. I am 60 now, and I would not take offense if someone close to me suggested what your husband did. I am proud of my age and every gray hair on my head. Take it as a teaching moment. Getting old does not cause pain! Older people may have more pain because they have lived long enough to earn it by having arthritis or some other pain causing illness. You still deserve to find the cause of the pain and either treat the cause or treat the pain itself. He is your husband, mine is used to fixing things, watching me hurt and not being able to fix it, kills him. I don<APO>t know your husband, but he may have said it wrong, or at the wrong time for you. Only you know if you need to cut him some slack or kill him, lol. Don<APO>t worry, I will never blame it on your age. Take care, Annette""Unfortunately, opiates are about the only kind of strong pain meds there are. The sedation, itchy skin and nausea are all a part of the side effects of opiates, but the good news is that they usually go away with time. There are meds you can take in addition to the opiates to treat the side effects if necessary. Only you can decide which path to follow now. I don<APO>t know how much physical care you provide to your disabled relative, you may need to find someone else to help you until after your hip replacement surgery. Take care, Annette""As long as you can do that, good for you. My husband had hip replacement surgery a few years ago. Many folk don<APO>t need any kind of pain management after the acute post op period. Keep your sense of humor, that gets you through a lot. Take care, Annette""When my migraines were really bad I saw a neurologist in San Francisco who told me if I had used a drug in the past that worked, to just stop it for six weeks and start it again and it would likely work again. I would suggest you discuss with your doctor rotating the meds that work well for you. Decongestants are only meant to be used for short times, many people get a rebound effect from some decongestants and get even more congested if they stop after taking them for a long time. I don<APO>t use them for longer than a week at a time because I read that somewhere. One doctor suggested estrogen patches all month long so my estrogen levels would be even all month instead of going up and down. The drop in estrogen is one trigger that can cause migraines. Did they take out your ovaries when you had your hysterectomy? Take care, Annette""You are already taking opiates, what did you think the Vicodin and Percocets were? Are you just talking about long acting opiates? I have a strong aversion to mixing opiates and benzos, although some doctors still do it, I feel the interaction of the two produces bad results. If I were you, and I am not, I would taper off of the Xanax first, slowly according to my doctor<APO>s taper plan, then go on long acting opiates and see how it goes. I would use some other method of controlling anxiety instead of benzos. Cognitive behavioral therapy is harder work for the patient, but works as well in my opinion, if you put your mind to it. I used it for depression and it worked well for me, but it does take mindfulness. There are other meds also that may be useful if required. From what I have read it is far easier to become addicted to short acting opiates like Vicodin and Percocet than it is long acting opiates. Even then addiction is a very small side effect of opiates in any form, less than 1% is what is quoted nowadays in my nursing journal. I used a generic of MS Contin for over ten years, and now I am on methadone as it is far cheaper. I feel that long acting opiates are the proper treatment for chronic pain, as is using a short acting opiate for any breakthrough pain. I also use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy techniques, and my hot tub, and exercise, etc. for my chronic pain, I feel that even a small amount of relief from each of several treatment techniques will add up to significant relief when you do them all. The only other RX meds besides opiates that I take are gabapentin and zolpidem. I recently had surgery, and had no problems controlling post op pain. I also decreased my methadone by half and had no withdrawal symptoms. My husband has gone off of major opiates twice in his life without any withdrawal symptoms at all. I know because I was there the second time around. The first was over twenty years ago when he had cancer. The second was after he had hip replacement surgery a couple of years ago. I don<APO>t feel that addiction is the same as dependence, or that opiate withdrawal is something to be feared as long as it is done properly. Take care, Annette""Hi, Kelly Well said on all fronts! Good explanation of long acting opiates. All I can add is that I would not take methadone prescribed by a doctor without lots of experience using it. I have worked with it in a methadone clinic, dosing can be tricky. Take care, Annette""I think it is a great drug, but the dosing is trickier than other opiates, and patients also need to know that they CANNOT double up their pills because they still hurt. It doesn<APO>t work that way. Take care of yourself. Annette""See the surgeon and perhaps a neurologist, and see what they say. It is impossible to say what kind of treatments are available if one doesn<APO>t yet know the diagnosis. If you are having the worst pain you can even imagine (10) you should see your surgeon ASAP not ""later this month"". Did your surgeon okay you taking lots of aspirin? Take care, Annette""You need to go see your pcp and/or a neurologist to get a proper diagnosis. No one on line can diagnose you. You need to have a comprehensive history and examination done. You may need either blood tests or imaging done in addition. Take care, Annette""Find the basic heart healthy diet at the American Heart Association<APO>s website. Read and learn and go from there. Take care, Annette""First of all, surgeons are not good at long term pain management in my experience. They are trained to manage pain for a couple of weeks pot op, that is about it. I need more than you don<APO>t ""feel well"", to figure things out, later in your post you say you feel ""sick and fatigued and light-headed."" That kind of complaint usually means you are getting too much medicine, or it is a transient side effect and may go away with time. I would try working on my communication skills. Really specific complaints work best, saying you don<APO>t feel well could be interpreted to mean you have too much pain, or that you are sick to your stomach, or you had the flu/allergies/etc. that week. You may be being more specific with the doctor than you are here, so please don<APO>t take offense. Personally, I would want my doctor to treat my pain until it is managable. Once I find that point, I would deal with side effects like you mention by either waiting them out until they go away, or by slightly reducing my dose, either of my long acting med, or my breakthrough meds.. I don<APO>t think from reading research studies that it matters much which opiate you choose to use. I have not read a decent study that shows any one of them is better than another. I would concentrate more on the dose and frequency. Work with your doctor and tell him if they don<APO>t last 12 hours, I did that with my doctor and she changed my long acting opioid to every 8 hours. Take your insurance formulary with you to your appt. so he can see what is covered and what is not. I think it is kind of rude to take the RX home and then call him later and tell him on the phone something isn<APO>t covered. There is no sense in him ordering something that is so expensive for you that you may not take it correctly. I have told my doctor that I will only use generics unless she can show me evidence based studies that prove the brand name drug is actually a better deal. So far, nothing has shown up better. That is just my personal preference. Keep trying different combos and I am sure you will find the right thing for you. Just know that we are all different and you just have to keep trying different stuff. You are on the right track, I believe that less is almost always better for me too. Take care, Annette""I would see a neurologist next. I would also assume that feet take a long time to become pain free simply because we use them for weight bearing every single day. They don<APO>t get much real rest. Take care, Annette""I agree with CBT except, I would talk to the doctor in person with a friend of relative with me. I would not discuss this over the phone with a nurse or asst.That is just me... Take care, Annette""Ditto what Trudy said. My doctor sends out her urine tests for gas chromatography also, it is very expensive, over $300. Last time she did it, she didn<APO>t charge me at all, because Medicare won<APO>t pay for non-medically necessary tests. The lab just doesn<APO>t charge for Medicare folk. She didn<APO>t say anything to me so I guess they all came out like they should. I had an employer<APO>s random testing years ago and it did not show the Vicodin I was taking daily for pain, or the Klonopin I was taking either. I suspect they were using a cheaper and less precise urine screening system. Perhaps they didn<APO>t even screen for those drugs back then. I would let the doctor know at my next appt. that in the past I have tested negative for oxycodone while taking it, and just see what he says. They test to make sure you are actually taking the drug and not selling it on the street or giving it to your friends and family. They hate it if they think that drugs are being diverted illegally. Take care, Annette""I also have to say that my doctor only tested me once in over 15 years. Not sure why, but I think the signs are there to scare away the drug abusers. Take care, Annette""I am only aware of doctors who are prescribing opiates that are prescribed to be taken daily doing drug tests. But even if you did not take the drugs daily, the basic urine drug screen will show opiates in your system for up to 72 hours after your last dose. Part of the reason my doctor<APO>s tests are so expensive is that she checks for the amount of the drugs in the urine, not just their presence, and the asst. asks you specifically when you last took a dose and how much you took before she collects the urine. If my test were negative, that would point to a difference about how it was prescribed and how I was actually taking it. Although no test specifically means diversion, that would be a pretty strong clue. Everyone has different instructions on how they are to take their meds. I don<APO>t believe that drug tests are infallible, the doctors I know just use them as one tool. I have never run out of opiates too soon, my doctor is very good about prescribing a specific number of pills, and setting up appts. for the next RX. She can count, lol. Take care, Annette Take care, Annette""Hi, Where did you find the information about Paxil lowering the pain relieving effects of opiates up to 80%? Is there a link to a professional journal that you could share with us? In my nursing drug handbookis actually says that some opioids may affect the Paxil in the blood, actually elevating that level. Perhaps the pharmacist who gave you that info could share with us the name of the article and the names of the authors. It is killer to have a good pharmacist on your side. Take care, Annette""I would go ahead and make an appt. with whatever doctors are available. Otherwise, a year will go by and you could still be stuck with this doctor. I don<APO>t see a PM doctor but once in a blue moon, about every ten years...my internist who is my pcp writes the RXs for my pain meds (including gabapentin, I like it too). I am on a low dose of methadone and a BT med for the bad times, but the difference between your doctor and mine is that mine stated out loud that ""No one should have to decrease their activities due to their pain levels."" She has adjusted my pain meds as necessary over the years, both up and down. I also have FMS, so we know we won<APO>t do damage to our joints or muscles by doing activities. I have also found that it is not wise for me to limit my activities based on fear of hurting tomorrow or the next day. I do what I want to do, then schedule in rest periods to compensate. I have now worked in belly dancing periods of 1-2 hours a day, along with strengthening exercises based on a book I got from a class on living with chronic illnesses. So far so good. Take care, Annette""I also take gabapentin and have for nearly 12-13 years now. I felt somewhat drunk at first, as I take my total daily dose once a day after supper. That side effect passed and my doctor and I adjusted my dose until I felt I got good benefits, including help with pain levels, and I now have no side effects at all. I take 800 mg. per day. I really do not understand why a person who is willing to go through all that you already do, and also takes clonazepam twice a day is reluctant to even try a drug like gabapentin. I have used clonazepam in the past, and it has far more possible ill effects than gabapentin. You will never know what your personal side effects will be from any drug until you try it yourself. Take care, Annette""In my experience, it is a matter of trial and error as you go along that you come to realize what you can and can<APO>t do and how much pain it is likely to cause. I personally do not skip doing something because it will cost me pain-wise. My doctor is great and treats my pain as needed. I pace myself due to fatigue, and also due to pain I guess. But if it hurts too much, I have meds or my hot tub. I took morphine for over ten years and now I am on methadone with BT meds. They have seldom made me pain free, so I can tell if I am having a problem that needs the doctor<APO>s attention. I have been taking opiates for around 15 years on a daily basis. I guess part of it depends on why you are having pain to start out with. I would discuss all that stuff with your doctor. Take care, Annette""I have only been to pain management doctors for consultations, my pcps (and one rheumatologist) have always manged my pain. They have been doing it for well over 15 years of daily opiate treatment and another nine years or so before that of intermittant opiates for pain management. Do all the research you can and take articles from main line journals to your appts. with you. My doctors have all appreciated that. My brother found that vicodin helped him more than percocet, so who knows. I took a generic of Vicodin for BT meds up until last year. Everyone is different. What have you tried in addition to opiates? There are lots of things to try, a bit of help from many sources might add up to plenty of help. Take care, Annette""What kind of side effects have you had on the morphine? Take care, Annette""Thanks for all the good information. I hope it continues to work well for you. Never inject any medicine in an area that is red, hot or lumpy. You won<APO>t get as good absorption of the drug. Do not get complacent either about rotating injection sites, often diabetics will find a place that is easier to get to, or just more comfortable for them, and stop rotating sites. Sometimes a chart of possible sites is helpful and you can check off each site as you use it. Nurses often do that as we change patients often. Take care, Annette""No, it was not Miralax, it was Mirapex. There had been a study showing that using it for FMS might work. They did not include nausea and vomiting as side effects. It was a slightly larger dose than for other uses. My pharmacist was not surprised though, he said folks who take it often complain of nausea and vomiting, just not as bad as I had it. It is used for Parkinson<APO>s and also for RLS and FMS. Take care, Annette PS, Beth is a nurse, like me, and knows how to give injections. We always check for blood by aspirating the syringe slightly before injecting the drug. If you get a flash of blood in the syringe you know you are in a blood vessel and should not inject the medicine there.""As someone with FMS I have tried Magnesium for that, but it did not loosen up my bowels. Thanks for the suggestion, it may well help someone else. Magnesium is why Milk of Magnesia works as a laxative. Take care, Annette""Hi, Beth I can sure understand why desperation moves us to do things we would not otherwise do. Thank goodness, I haven<APO>t been there yet regarding constipation. Hugs, Annette""Not everyone responds to over the counter bowel stimulants forever, they also may stop working after awhile. I totally agree that is the best place to start though. Take care, Annette""How often must you inject yourself? I do best when I have a BM every day or at least every other day, does that mean daily or nearly daily injections? There are also side effects in the subQ tissues from constant injections of some meds. How long have you been using this drug? How long has it been in use generally, not in clinical trials? I will at least read up on it, but I believe that unless I have a problem with the stimulant type lax pills that I currently use, I will stick to them as the least invasive choice. Thanks for posting an option for those who need it. Take care, Annette""I just looked it up in my drug handbook and it lists adverse events by percentages. It lists abdominal pain at 29%, flatulence at 13%, and nausea at 12%. Other side effects all fall below 10% and include dizziness, and sweating at 7% and diarrhea at 6%. I don<APO>t consider adverse effects that appear in more than ten percent of users to be ""quite rare"". I give great shots according to others, lol, and have self injected Imetrex, Lovenox, and flu vaccine. I agree with you that it is the slow speed of injection that makes a good shot. No one feels the needle go in if you are any good at all, it is when you inject the medicine that people complain, especially if you inject it too fast. My book also says it is only for those in advanced states of illness who are receiving palliative care. It is not available in generic yet, I would wonder how long it has been used and how often. Take care of yourself. Hugs, Annette""It seems to me that anything that causes extreme vomiting and nausea can also cause dehydration, and tachycardia and hypotension could go along with the dehydration. I can<APO>t believe it got you to the ER though it is not hard to picture that. I had an adverse reaction to Mirapex once and vomited every hour for a day and a half. After two days, I had a huge argument with my dear husband because I swore it was only one day that had gone by. He finally had to show me the newspaper to convince me what day it was. He had offered to take me to the ER while I was still sick but I told him it was just a reaction to the meds and would pass. Had I realized it had lasted two days already, I might have let him take me. I also had a long talk with the drug company that manufactured the drug. Filled out a bunch of forms, etc. You are a brave soul, I would not be the first patient my doctor prescribed anything to, lol. Hugs, Annette""I would stick with one doctor, if the rheumy feels right to you, stick with him. You both have to learn to trust each other and develop a relationship. It makes for better medical care in the long run. Take care, Annette""I have Fibro and restless legs too. I use gabapentin and zolpidem and between those two I have stopped kicking all night long (per my husband), and no longer wear holes in my bottom sheets where my feet go. I also force myself to get in the hot tub, EVERY night before bedtime. It makes a huge difference. I notice it when I go visit my son, and only have a bath tub or shower to use each night. I don<APO>t worry about back problems or spinal things getting worse, because I know I won<APO>t consent to surgery unless I am having a functional deficit that they can follow precisely. The restless leg thing you mention might also be due to lowering your methadone. If you ride it out for awhile it might go away. Take care, Annette""What does DBT stand for? I went to a therapist and when I moved away she suggested a book about cognitive behavioural therapy. It was great. I wish she had suggested it sooner, lol. Some pain management doctors do not use oral meds at all, they just do injections. I have never had those. Take care, Annette""I have found that CBT helps in all areas of my life. It does not necessarily decrease my pain, but it does alter how I respond to the pain and other stresses too. My pcp manages my meds for pain and other problems. I saw a therapist for the depression when I first stopped working. She is the one that turned me on to CBT. It turned my life around but it takes constant work on my part. it isn<APO>t something that cures you, it is something you have to continue to practice for life. The doctor you saw sounds terrible, I don<APO>t think I would see him again. Take care, Annette""I would get a pain management specialist at the hospital to go over your plans and goals, when he also can be there along with the rest of the caregivers managing your care.. It sounds like you and all your doctors need to have a meeting together and sit down and work things out to try to help you address your need for meds once an for awile. Give then time to work and then in a couple of week, (sooner if necessary) you can adjust them a bit.""After you have tried all the non-opioid meds, you can always try regular old pain pills of the opioid variety. That is something to discuss with the pain management doctor. Surgeons are not equipped to deal with chronic pain, only regular post op pain. Some pain management doctors are interventionists and prescribe little or no oral medicine, they do injections, etc. I would personally go to a PM doctor that uses all means available to control your pain, including opioids, adjuvant medicines, PT, OT, biofeedback, massage, exercise, life style changes, your TENS unit, hot and cold treatments, etc. in addition to injections and other invasive treatments. I would call ahead and ask him what he offers before you keep the appt., just so you and he are on the same page. Take care, Annette""Drinking alcohol for pain management is seldom if ever the right answer. I have never met anyone other than alcoholics getting pain relief from alcohol. Please discuss this part of your own treatment plan with your doctor. For now, I feel that drugs are the answer for me. I don<APO>t have any side effects other than constipation, and I know how to handle that. Take care, Annette""I was just re-reading my post, yikes!!! Although I do believe that drugs are PART of the answer for me, they are certainly not ALL of what I do for pain. I use many non-drug techniques and also use non-opioid meds. I am so sorry for giving anyone the idea that just taking a magic pill will fix everything. They don<APO>t even exist so far as I know. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t understand what ""Obamacare"" has to do with the British system, but I guess we will see. ""Obamacare"" is not a governement run health care program, it does is tell us we have to buy health insurance and has altered some of the rules that the insurance companies are used to. Anyone who thinks that their doctor is really totally in charge of their health care now, has never battled the insurance companies for a preferred drug or procedure that they and their doctors want. Not everything is covered under our system, and not every thing is covered under the British system. I am not sure which is better, but all the Canadian nurses I know chose to go back to Canada for major chronic health care. They just worked here for awhile, and then went home again. Since I have not been troubled so much by either the insurance companies or the government run Medicare that I now have, I doubt I am the expert on this subject. Take care, Annette""Being obese might delay healing in some folk, but it does not in everyone. A lot depends on the definition of obese. I fit in that category by medical definitions, and I just had a breast reduction surgery to decrease my pain. I have had a number of surgeries, elective and emergent while being fat, and never had any problems healing. I healed quickly, no infections, and my pain is much improved. I consider it a huge success, and only wished I had done it when I was much younger, I am 60. Medicare okayed my surgery as medically necessary and helped pay for it. I am as down on smoking as anyone, and have seen horror stories regarding non-healing of incisions and non-union of bones either traumatically broken or cut in the operating room. That said my mom was a smoker and had some surgeries in later life and did fine, healed normally, etc. There are doctors now who refuse to do surgery on smokers at all. My neurosurgeon was one (plastic surgeons are another group who often feel the same way), he said the possible complication rate was too high, he did nicotene blood testing on all his patients to make sure they were not smokers. I believe we ration health care now. I think it is an economic reality, there is not unlimited funding for medical care. I also worked as a RN in Critical Care, and I agree, just because you can, does not mean you should. I would prefer this be up to the attending doctor and the patient though. Blanket rules without exceptions just do not cover all the possibilities out there. Take care, Annette""The ENT is the right person to go see. If he doesn<APO>t help you, then I would see a neurologist. Do you have diabetes? Diabetic neuropathy in the head is rare, but a TV doctor said it is possible to get this kind of neuropathy in the nerves of the face/head. Take care, Annette""Is it connected to migraines or tension headaches? If so it might be that if you treat the headache and it goes away, the ear pain may go with it. I have also heard of diabetic neuropathy occurring in the ears, are you a diabetic? If your ears have been thoroughly checked by an ENT doctor, and declared alright, then you might have your doctor discuss with other possibilities where the pain might be from a systemic problem. Take care, Annette""You need to see a doctor and let him/her examine you in addition to taking your medical history. No one can diagnose you on line. Take care, Annette""I would let your dentist know and perhaps he can prescribe something else. I have taken unrelated drugs that did the same thing to me. One also gave me hallucinations while I was still awake and one gave me horrible nightmares. My MD changed the meds to something else. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t think it is common, but it certainly happens that young guys have chronic pain. I wouldn<APO>t focus on one or more drugs for relief. I would tell your doctor what your goals are as far as activities go and ask him how to get there from here. He may prescribe drugs, he may suggest other modalities. As you work together to get your pain levels down to what you can manage, the two of you should develop trust that goes both ways. That should be the basis for any good doctor/patient relationship. It sounds like you are very sedentary, not necessary for bilateral knee problems. You still have an upper body, perhaps a recumbent bicycle that takes the weight off of your knees, or water exercise, or a bicycle that you power with your arms? There are even just exercises to do in a chair on your upper body that folks who are wheelchair or mostly bed bound can do. It is very important to keep your upper body in good shape even if you are unable to exercise your legs due to other problems. What kind of surgeries did you have on your knees? Osteochondritis-Dissecans, for others reading this post, is a form of avascular necrosis, the bone dies due to a lack of circulation. There are at least a couple of surgical options for treatment. You don<APO>t mention any diagnosis that explains your back pain, if that has been going on for awhile I would ask my pcp to evaluate it. Take care, Annette""For AVN of my husband<APO>s hip, he used a cane to walk with, two kinds of opiate pain meds, a short-acting one and a long-acting one, and an antidepressant that is commonly used in pain management. I use an antiseizure med for my chronic pain. We both used the hot tub for pain relief. He continued to work so he never really got sedentary. I don<APO>t know how he did it though. He lasted about two years before he finally had the surgery to replace his hip. But he was much older than you. I would see an orthopedist who specializes in knees at a medical school teaching hospital. You want to see someone who does just knees if possible. This would be true even if you had to fly somewhere for an appt. At least get his opinion on what to do. You are never out of options! Take care, Annette""I want to thank both you and Proof43 for your service to our country. My son also did 8 years in the Corps and all that humping will ruin a man<APO>s knees, I think everyone who had all that marching and hiking in the Service should get reimbursed for it. My son is only 33 and his knees are a mess also. I think part of the VA<APO>s poor response to pain is the whole military culture of sucking it up. Hopefully, they will come around along with civilian hospitals/healthcare. I have to say that in my experience in nursing, the VA hospitals have vastly different reputations depending on what community they are in. I live in Portland, OR, now and the VA here is well thought off, but the VA in Reno had a terrible reputation back when I lived there. Best of luck to both of you. Take care, Annette""I would get a consult with a gynecologist, take copies of all the lab work including the elevated prolactin level with you. At 19, it could be difficult figuring out why she is having so much breast pain, but I bet a GYN could do it if anyone could. Take care, Annette""I also have FMS, I however, would not try nerve blocks unless I have a particular area that needed relief due to some other problem. I don<APO>t believe the widespread pain of FMS is affected by nerve blocks. Just my opinion. Take care, Annette""I would ask your pharmacist about all your meds. Often, each one will cause a certain amount of constipation, but when you add them all together it really shows. Take care, Annette""I agree with Swank. Usually, post op pain gradually goes away, or waxes and wanes. Be prepared if it does come back, I would keep a few pills on hand just in case at this stage. Usually the RX for opiate pain pills says to take them ""every 4-6 hours as needed"", rather than around the clock whether you have pain or not. Call your doctor with any questions you have. Discuss all of this with your own doctor at your next post op appt. anyway. I suggest you write down all your meds that you are currently taking along with how often you are taking them, and also write down all your concerns and questions to discuss also. Write down the doctor<APO>s instructions as he goes along, it is very easy to forget what he said later on. Take care, Annette""What did they give you? Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t think anyone should try and read up on this topic then withdraw their meds on their own. Please talk to your pcp and let him know exactly why you feel coming off of this med is the best thing for you, and follow his taper instructions. If you are going through withdrawal big time now, I suspect you are not following a slow enough taper. Take care, Annette""No, Ativan in a benzo, it is unrelated to opiates at all. It does however treat some withdrawal effects from withdrawing from opiates. Please speak to your MD about all of this. Take care, Annette""I disagree that opiate withdrawal alone can last six months from the past dose. Benzos are a completely different animal than opiates though. I cannot imagine the mix of the two, and going through that withdrawal on my own. I do agree that you need to be under a doctor<APO>s care, even if you want to go faster, most doctors will say okay, and treat you again if it is too much for you to deal with. However, it you just quit and do not stay under your doctor<APO>s care, it may be tougher to get a doctor to manage you later on. Take care, Annette""Hang in there with your decision. I am so glad that you have some doctor involved with all of this. Just follow his instructions and keep in close contact with him. I was given Ativan for withdrawal from Klonopin (another benzo) I did not have to taper off of the Ativan, I only used it as needed, like you are doing. Unless you use it for awhile on a set schedule, you should not have to taper it. Again, go with your doctor<APO>s recommendations. Withdrawal from any drug is an individual thing, some people have a harder time with withdrawals than other people. Take care, Annette""I am so glad to hear that you are doing well and have a doctor looking out for you during this time. I try not to question why anyone does not want to be on opiates, if they want to get off of any drug it is better to have a doctor supervising. The question about how addictive a drug is changes every day, with opiates being found to be less and less addictive as more medical studies are done. The latest studies I have read show opiates are addictive in less than 1% of users. That is a VERY small number, but still something to be aware of. I feel all doctors should tell patients all the things to be concerned about when prescribing any drug. It is always a trade off between possible beneficial and adverse effects when one decides to use a medication. Take care, Annette""Although the fentanyl is pretty much done as far as pain control goes after 72 hours, you body is still going through withdrawal from the opiates, that is why you still have the leg cramps/pain. I would call your doctor and ask him what to do and how long he expects it to last. Using the Ativan occasionally might do the trick, but I would suggest you talk to him. Hot baths/soaks might do the trick. Placing hot wet towels over your legs might help too. Opiate withdrawal can last a week or two from what I have read. Everyone is different, that is why I suggest you speak to your own doctor. He knows you and your medical history better than we do. Take care, Annette""Hi, Bren<UD>bren I got terrible leg cramps when I stopped taking Klonopin, they never stopped, I ended up with RLS, it feels a bit different though. I might have gotten RLS anyway, but I never had a symptoms of it before then. There is a difference between treating RLS and treating leg cramps from opiate withdrawal. Different thing entirely. I take Neurontin (generic=gabapentin) now, I started taking it for FMS symptoms, and it really helped my RLS too. It said in my nursing journal that some form of neurontin was just approved for RLS specifically, you only have to take it once daily, special formula for once daily use. I had to laugh, I take the old, cheap, generic gabapentin once a day, it works fine that way. My doctor says most of her chronic pain patients take it once a day anyway rather than three times a day, and it works as well. I have been taking it for about 12 years now. Take care, Annette""I hope you have called your pcp and let him know what happened over the weekend, and in urgent care. When you say he, do you mean your own doctor that is managing the taper, or the urgent care doctor? I would personally ride it out at this point, you are at least half way through, the worst of the withdrawals is probably behind you. What non-drug methods are you using to control the leg pains? Take care, Annette""I have read in one article in a medical journal that they recommended that opiates only be tapered by 10% of the total daily dose per week. That slow a taper should really reduce withdrawal symptoms. Be careful with the ativan as that is also habit forming. Be sure to use it as prescribed for only the length of time that it might take to get your opiates tapered. Don<APO>t take extra or save any to use later. Take care, Annette""Please let your doctor know what is going on now. There are things that you can do with his help. I would not suggest anything more than I have already. As long as he doesn<APO>t hear from you he will think you are well and doing great. That is not the case. Take care, Annette PS, I am think of you.""Why are you going to different doctor again, I thought one of them was helping you. I would stick with the doctor of your choice for awhile and see how it goes as this drug gets our of your system. Take care, Annette""Addiction is rare for anyone who takes opioid meds for pain as long as they follow their doctor<APO>s instructions. The latest studies say less than 1% of folks who take them become addicted. I have never heard anyone say that addiction only happens if you are 40 or younger though. I have known lots of older opiate addicts. Take care, Annette""I assume the doctor you said you saw Friday was your PCP? The reason I said to pick one doctor and just see him whas because you mentioned a surgeon, a neurologist, your pcp, an Urgent Care doc, and then said that you made an appt. with a doctor that your friends suggested. I went back and reread this whole thread and that is what I got. I assume that by ""my doctor"" you mean your PCP so all of my assumptions now are based on that. I have no way of knowing which is which unless you tell us. I don<APO>t know why you are having leg pain, if it was related to opiate withdrawal or something else entirely, no way for any of us to know. That is why I have repeatedly said to discuss all of this with your own doctor. I told you at the very beginning to keep in close contact with him because if he doesn<APO>t hear from you, he will reasonably assume you are doing fine. I do not recommend you diagnose yourself, that is why I go to my doctor. Take care, Annette""Since the leg pain has not yet been worked up fully, so that you have a diagnosis of something that you can deal with, I would continue on with your pcp while you seek symptom relief from a pain management specialist. Missycats35 suggested you have a doppler study done of your legs to rule out blood clots since you recently had surgery, that is a worthwhile thing to do in my opinion. I had a DVT after spinal surgery, I diagnosed it myself the morning I was to go home from the hospital. My neurosurgeon was so arrogant that he wrote my discharge orders anyway, and just wrote for the test to be done before I went home. I stayed in the hospital for a week more to get anticoagulated. Even though your surgery was some time ago and the symptpms seem to be bilateral rather than on just one side, it is still possible. I hope you were clear with your pcp about how much this was hurting you, most of us tend to minimize our symptoms while at the doctor. I am not sure why, we don<APO>t do ourselves any favors that way. Let me know how the doctor<APO>s appt. went. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know what the ""neural therapy"" is? I assume with D5W it is some kind of injection or IV??? Can you share more about this procedure? I would personally avoid any therapies that the doctor could not show me via evidence based medical studies work for my conditions. We all get fed up with the pain, and often allow a doctor to do things without finding out all we can about it first. As you learned with the doctor who put you on fentanyl to begin with, they are not always entirely honest with us. I am not a big fan of Ativan or benzos in general, but one a day to sleep for a short period of time sounds fairly reasonable for opiate withdrawal. Did your pcp think it would take 6 MORE weeks to get done with withdrawal, or six weeks from your last fentanyl dose? What did the PM specialist say about the leg cramping? Does she feel it is due to opiate withdrawal also? How long does she think it should last? She might have more experience with this since she deals with pain meds all the time. Best of luck, I will keep my fingers crossed for you with these new treatments. Take care, Annette""The problem is that people can get the same kind of withdrawals from any opioid, including Norco. Some studies say that tolerance and dependence can develop faster with short acting opioids, vs. long acting ones. I am in total agreement with you, we all should be reading more about our meds before we decide to take them. I also use my pharmacist as an active part of my health care team. Take care, Annette""The microcurrent sound similar to a TENS unit, they help with some pain sometimes. I use one occasionally for pain, it works some, some of the time. I have never heard of using this microcurrent therapy to detox the body of anesthesia, I will have to Google that one. My neurosurgeon told me it takes about 6 weeks to get all the anesthesia drugs out of your system as they cling to the fat cells in your body and are then released slowly back into your blood stream and gotten rid of. It certainly was my experience after my neck surgery in 1992, I was exhausted constantly, but it seemed to let up when he told me it would. The second therapy you mentioned sounds like Prolotherapy to me. I read where with that they inject sterile water with or without medicine right into areas that they feel are inflamed. The theory is that this will cause the body to send anti-inflammatory agents and decrease the amount of inflammation and thus decrease pain. Prolotherapy has not been proven to be useful in my opinion. I am not sure this is even the same thing, just sounds like it. To me, this is invasive since they are sticking you with needles, and injecting a foreign substance into you. I would want to see real studies that showed this was a good therapy for what ails me. I doubt that this would cause you any problems as far as infection, etc. Is she doing this to help your leg cramps/pain or just around the scar area from your surgery? I have a midline abdominal scar from my belly button to my pubic hairline. I felt all kinds of strange sensations along it after surgery for about two years. They would come and go. But were never bad enough to treat. They went away on their own with time. Now I had breast reduction surgery in January, and I have weird fleeting pains and things along that incision line. I expect them to go away on their own also. Chest tubes are nasty, I have never had one, just assisted in inserting them. It is brutal, I imagine it hurts alot, and that pain would be part of the healing process. I understand you wanting to be rid of that sensation. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""I went and Googled both of these procedures. They are not medical doctor things they are usually done by chiropractors and naturopaths. The microcurrent therapy website that I visited claimed that it fixed all kinds of different things from kidney stone pain, to FMS pain, to the actual lesions of Shingles. The practitionerstook a three day course, and bought the equipment and could go to work. The other one, the neural therapy is also done by chiropractors. The website I read claimed that 100% relief of pain should be immediate. I did not find evidence-based studies for these things. I generally do not find good studies to support chiropractic treatments. When I followed the instructions, I found chiropractors and naturopathic doctors in my area who did this stuff, but not MDs. Good luck to you, let us know how it works out for you. Take care, Annette""I am glad that you checked her out thoroughly, it sounds like you did your homework on this one for sure. I had breast reduction surgery around the same time you had much more invasive surgery. I still have pains along my incision line and bras are not the most comfortable things to wear anyway. I usually wear one while exercising and when I go out, but don<APO>t the rest of the time. A chest tube is a horribly painful thing to have done to you, let alone lung surgery. Shouldn<APO>t you expect to have pains along the incision lines at this point? It has only been six months? I had abdominal surgery with a mid line incision and I had pains along that one for several years. They did gradually get better over time. I<APO>m with you, the microcurrent thing sounds like it wouldn<APO>t hurt anyway, the needle thing bothers me though. How about waiting to schedule the needles until after you see how the microcurrent things goes? At least then you would know the doctor better, and have some idea about how much you trust her. You haven<APO>t had the best luck with doctors lately. Take care, Annette""Why would you let a doctor of any kind do injections that you do not know the reason for??? The scars from gall bladder and kidney surgery are at some distance from your lung surgery scar are they not? Do they still hurt you significantly? I have been taking gabapentin for nearly 12 years now, I think. I went up to 1800 mg. a day, then decreased it slowly, 300 mg. per day once a week, until I got to 900 mg. Going much lower made my pain and other FMS symptoms return. I ended up at 800 mg. per day because that way I could take one pill per day. I take mine at supper time. I would never give it up, it works really well for me. It helps me with pain, migraines, irritable bowel, irritable bladder, and RLS. At last I stopped wearing holes in the bottom sheet from kicking my feet all night long. I have no side effects at all from it. At first I felt kind of drunk from it, but that wore off quickly. Let me know how it works for you as you get down to a lower dose, and off of it completely. Remember, you are in charge, so let her know how you are doing each step of the way. Take care, Annette""I went to that site and the guy they were talking about was a chiropractor, not an MD, but a DC. The sites I Googled had the same diagrams, and promised instant relief, just like this one did. I did not buy the guy with ""the shirt being pulled on"" as an analogy for any kind of medical issue. I disagree with the basics of this whole theory. Of course, the disclaimer at the bottom of the page didn<APO>t instill confidence either. If the older scars did not cause me any problems, I would not let anyone inject them with anything. I would personally go back to my pcp, stay on the neurontin, and get a referral to a different pain management MD from my pcp, rather than friends/family. I would not taper off of any meds without speaking to my pcp first. My pcp manages all my meds, I feel safer that way. Any consultants I see, send her a report with their recommendations, and she and I then talk about it, and decide together what to do. But, she writes all the medicine prescriptions herself. The only exception to this was when I saw a surgeon last January, the surgeon wrote for two weeks of additional pain meds after my surgery, and some other surgery related meds, but it was all discussed ahead of time and the two doctors agreed on this. All of this is just what I would do, not necessarily what you would or should decide to do. You need to decide for yourself what is acceptable treatment, and go for it. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""That was your experience on methadone, it is not everyone<APO>s. My husband has tapered off of methadone twice in the last twenty years in a matter of weeks with no withdrawals at all. NONE. He also tapered off of morphine and also oxycodone without any trouble. He has the right biology for opioids, I guess, lol. I am currently on methadone and have been for nearly two years. I reduced it by half over three weeks last January (after surgery which reduced my pain) with no withdrawals at all. I expect if I went off of it altogether, I would have increased pain as my untreated pain came back full force. I expect I will have to gradually increase it over time as I develop tolerance to it. I have been on opioids for fifteen years now so I know how my body responds to them. EVERYONE responds differently, and I think you are spot on when you say folks need to work through this WITH their doctor. People who stop taking any drugs without discussing it with their doctor first are playing with fire. I hope your current treatment plan keeps you relatively comfortable. Take care, Annette""I think the main thing to remember is that there is a difference between addiction and dependence, they are treated differently medically and psychologically. Take care, Annette""I would not recommend you do anything different without speaking to your doctor about it. You are on multiple meds, please, please speak to your MD about all of this. Take care, Annette""Thanks for the info. I looked it up later. I am glad it is working so well for you. I have never found anything but my hot tub that wiped the pain completely away, lol. I wish that lasted, after I get out the pain comes back. There are mixed reviews on Nucynta from what I have read, but that seems to be true for all meds. How often, and at what dose do you take it? If you don<APO>t want to say, I completely understand. Take care, Annette""I have only heard of this on line, not in person. I have a question and a comment that might help next time you try a new drug. My question is what would you do with it anyway? If it doesn<APO>t work, why would you take it again? You certainly would not give them to anyone else. So why not let them dispose of it properly, in front of you, while you watch? That would prevent any reuse of the pills which would be illegal. We are told not to flush pills down the toilet or toss them in the garbage without mixing them with used kitty litter or coffee grounds. (I don<APO>t have a cat or drink coffee, so I am not sure what I am to do? Anyone else know, please post...) The comment is that every pharmacy I have been to would let me fill a partial RX of a new drug to see if it worked, so I didn<APO>t have to lay out so much money on an unknown drug. Then if it worked and I didn<APO>t have any unacceptable side effects I could fill the rest of it. The exception to this might be Schedule II opiates, I don<APO>t know about those. But I don<APO>t think Nucynta is a Schedule II. Ask your pharmacist. For the present situation if you don<APO>t want to give the pills to the doctor<APO>s office, I would ignore the nurse<APO>s instructions. See the doctor, get the new RX for percocet, and if the doctor asks for the old pills, just tell him you forgot them. See what happens, at worst you will have to go get them, but not after asking the doctor if he is willing to pay you what you paid for them, or explain why they have such a policy. Take care, Annette""I have never heard of a pharmacy giving someone a refund for partially used RX drugs. They can<APO>t re-use them or re-dispense them. I live on the West Coast, perhaps this is a regional thing? I never heard of it before. Take care, Annette""I am sorry, I was in error by using the word refund, I should have said credit. I have never had that option or even heard of it before, but like I said it may be a geographical thing. I live on the West Coast, I have lived in Calif.,NV, and Oregon. I understand why the doctor would want to see them, although again, that has never been a condition out here where I live. Our doctors don<APO>t even do pill counts. Devilsgurl15 sounded surprised about the whole thing, so I assumed that she either did not have a contract with her doctor, or signed it without reading it. It has not been a part of any PM contract I have signed or my husband has signed with any of our doctors. Take care, Annette""I truly believe that most weight gain is a matter or eating more calories than you burn off. Even many drugs that cause weight gain, actually cause an increase in the sensation of hunger, but what you eat is up to you. Healthy food, or junk food. I personally prefer the junk food, lol. I have been fat all of my adult life, I am now 60 years old. The last few years, I have been slowly losing weight, a few more pounds each time I go to the doctor every couple of months. After about a year, I started belly dancing along with a TV show called ""Shimmy"", then I bought DVDs on line to practice with. I have lost a total of about 50 pounds, and I still eat junk. But, I burn off more than I eat. The best thing about belly dancing for me is that it isolates the areas you want to work on, so I can opt to dance, but not use muscles that hurt. Even right after breast reduction surgery, I could dance using the hips and legs, but not the chest and shoulders. As my best friend said to me, weight control is a marathon not a sprint. So go slowly. My Internist, who manages all my meds for me, is great about prescribing what I need so I don<APO>t worry about increased pain. You might check with local hotels or motels with pools, or call your local Arthritis Assoc. and see if they know where the pools are near you. Many motels and hotels will charge you a minimal amount each month to just use their pools. I love swimming, I just don<APO>t like having to factor getting there and home on their schedule. I am a night owl. Take care, Annette""Just do whatever you will enjoy and are likely to keep on doing. There are all kinds of dance classes on TV so if belly dancing isn<APO>t your thing, try salsa....etc. Take care, Annette""I would call the manufacturers of these two drugs and tell them your history. All drug companies have an adverse effect department that takes these kinds of calls, and does investigations into the medicines. Meanwhile ask your doctor about an alternative. Perhaps get out of the NSAID family of drugs altogether. Take some other kind of pain medicine. There are other choices. Take care, Annette""If you call the Arthritis Foundation in your area, they usually have a list of swimming pools in your area that are heated a bit warmer than usual. This helps with folks with FMS and arthritis who like having the water hotter than other folks. Take care, Annette""I would discuss your concerns about it taking so long to get an appt. with the doctor himself. The staff often have little control over how he wants his day scheduled. He is the boss after all. My doctor keeps a couple of appts. each day open for emergencies, as does my husband<APO>s doctor. If no one needs them, they do paperwork, there is plenty of that. Since you have already had a couple of CT scans, and been examined, I doubt you have a fracture, but I guess anything is possible. Take care, Annette""See your doctor first, then you might check in with your dentist. If your teeth don<APO>t feel they are aligning properly your jaw could be partially dislocated. Take care, Annette""I would not even try to diagnose you on line. I would finish the process and see what the neurologist says. My main comment about the drugs is that tramadol and hydrocodone only last as far as any effect goes for 4-6 hours, so they were acting as they should???? I would also try all the non-drug treatments like CBT, OT, PT, massage, exercise, heat, ice, etc. Especially the Cognitive Behavioural Therapy if you suspect anxiety as a part of your discomfort. I found it also helps with managing pain. Get moving, for sure, but only after your doctor okays it. Take care, Annette""Hi, Dr. A Could you post a link to the study you read? If not could you tell us how many patients were included in the study, and what their definition of ""positive results"" were? Thank you so much. Take care, Annette""Hi, Laura Read all you can, but pay attention to who sponsors the sites where you read. My favorite site for good medical info about FMS is http://www.myalgia.com . It is not an interactive site like this one, but the articles are very good and reliable in my opinion. Dr. Robert Bennett, MD is a rheumatologist who works at the university medical center where I live. He has done a lot of research on FMS with his group. I have tried many things in the 15 years that I have had FMS. What works for me may not work for you as far as meds go. But I feel that exercise is absolutely necessary to keep your muscles in good condition. I use my very tiny hot tub EVERY day, it is the one thing I can count on to make my pain go away, at least for a little while. Vitamins and supplements are up to you, I wouldn<APO>t get carried away. Try one thing at a time so you can see if it is actually helping or not. Continue with what actually helps you. Then on to the next thing. This is also a good idea with meds, as you will know what side effects are from what medicine. I think it is important to find the meds that help you sleep, and control your pain the best so you can exercise properly. Your doctor should help you with that. Go slow with the meds, you have to give some of them several weeks to see if they help or not. Also for the side effects to go away, they often do if you wait it out for several weeks. You didn<APO>t mention how old you are, but that is important also. Keep in touch. Take care, Annette""I forgot to add that a hot tub may not be a wise thing to use along with the fentanyl patch. Because I use my hot tub daily, my doctor and I decided not to even go to the patch. Increasing your body temperature can cause uneven absorption of the fentanyl in the patch. Although my doctor originally offered fentanyl patches to me, after we discussed how I used my hot tub, and my unwillingness to give it up, we decided to use oral meds for pain instead. Take care, Annette""I would be very careful while doing this, a blow dryer is not meant for this purpose and you might burn the skin. Take care, Annette""Hi, Kelly Rehab websites are there to sell you a product, not to save your life. They want everyone to be as scared of withdrawal as possible, so we will pay them big bucks to allow them to manage our detox and recovery from addiction. They are not there for folks who have become dependent on opiates, they are there for addicts. Go to reputable medical sites and read about opiate addiction/withdrawal. Not from someone in the business of making money off of addicts. I worked in a non-profit heroin addiction treatment center (no one had to pay to get treatment there) for several years, blood pressure and heart rates did not go sky high when folks went through opiate withdrawal. Certainly not stroke level. No one died from opiate withdrawal during that time, I don<APO>t think we gave any better medical care than anyone else did, I just think it is a rather benign withdrawal. Morphine has more of a blood vessel dilating side effect than other opiates which is why it is used for acute heart attacks, other opiates do not do that nearly as much and are not used for that. Different opiates have slightly different side effects. Would you have a heart attack if you stopped using opiates? I don<APO>t think anyone could tell you that. I doubt it though, just my opinion. Scheduled drugs in the US include marijuana with heroin and LSD, so I don<APO>t buy what the folks who made that list say. Cocaine is legal by the way, it is used in eye anesthesia, it is a Schedule II, along with plain old codeine. So in our government<APO>s humble opinion pot has the same potential for abuse as heroin and no legitimate medical use, and cocaine is equal to codeine in those properties. That list was made up in the 1930s, I believe, when the Harrison Act was passed. I don<APO>t think the opiates themselves know whether you bought them at a drug store with a RX or illegally on the street, so I don<APO>t think the withdrawal effects would change if one were taking the same dose of the same opiate. Of course, I agree one should always take and stop taking opiates, and other drugs, under a doctor<APO>s supervision. Sorry, but I still believe that anyone who died during, or immediately after, opiate withdrawals died of their pre-existing health issues. In 40 years of nursing I have never seen or heard of anyone dying from opiate withdrawal, nor have I read anything like that in nursing/medical journals. I would be happy to see any evidence based medical articles that say anything about opiate withdrawal causing death. I am always more than willing to read anything anyone sends my way. Knowledge is power. I will Google it again just to see. Take care, Annette""Hi, Roe The firemen at many fire stations would also be happy to check blood pressures, that is where my mom got hers checked all the time. I however, agree that buying your own digital BP monitor is the best investment in your health possible. They are easy to use and have all the normal-high levels written in their information so you can<APO>t forget them. High blood pressure is the ""Silent Killer"", it can sneak up on you over the years, or all at once. Heart attacks, strokes and kidney failure are often the first symptoms. Take care, Annette""Hi, Kelly We all learn from each other. I think that is the main point of the discussions here, or it should be anyhow. We all have areas of expertise to share with others, whether it is through education, professional experience or personal experience. I believe the more folks participate here the better it is for all of us. Take care, Annette""Although you and I disagree about benzos and their use for outpatients, I was still able to read your post calmly until I came to the part about opiate withdrawals being life threatening. That discussion has occurred on this board before, and no one has been able to post a single reliable source that states that opiate withdrawal alone in an otherwise healthy adult has ever caused death. Anecdotal evidence aside, if you have a source we have not been exposed to, please post it so we can all check it out. Opiate withdrawal, particularly among heroin addicts is a benign part of life. You can<APO>t hook up and get drugs, you get sick, you are miserable, and then you get well again, usually within a couple of weeks. Unfortunately, the problems of addiction are still there, and the addict usually goes back to their drugs. I worked for 4-5 years in a heroin addict recovery/treatment center many years ago. Not one client ever died of withdrawals while I worked there, even complex patients. Not all drugs cause dependency, antibiotics don<APO>t. Some do in some people and not in others. I drank caffeinated sodas daily in excess for many years, I read that my bladder problems might improve if I stopped the caffeine, so I went to the store and bought decaffeinated sodas, went home and tossed the others out. That was the end of caffeine for me, and I had no withdrawals at all. Other people get terrible headaches, like you mentioned. The bladder problems improved vastly within 24 hours. My husband can go on and off opiates and has never had withdrawals, even when he should have had them. I wish everyone would carefully read the information that their pharmacists pack with their RXs every time you fill them. This info applies to everyone, if you have any questions, discuss them with your MD and with your pharmacist. ALL withdrawals, from drugs should be overseen by your MD, on that you and I totally agree. Take care, Annette""Hi, Kelly I still take exception to your comments about opiates. The withdrawal from opiates does not include things like stroke or heart attacks, or seizures which could cause them. The withdrawal from benzos and/or alcohol does cause seizures, which can cause death. I would never put opiate withdrawal in the same sentence as benzo, alcohol, or cocaine withdrawal. It is completely different chemically and medically. Opiates do not suppress heart problems, so withdrawing from them does not cause reverse these kinds of problems. TV aside, do some research on this subject, and you will probably find that withdrawals from alcohol, benzos, and stimulants are totally different than withdrawals from opiates. As usual, I am open to any information from reliable medical sources. If you find any articles in medical journals or other reliable sources regarding opiate withdrawal that say it is deadly, please post the links or names of the articles/authors so others can read them. We had a discussion about this here 6-12 months ago, and I looked through the info I was able to find and did not find anything relating death to opiate withdrawals. I went through medical sites, like Medscape, the Mayo Clinic site, etc. My brother is an alcoholic and although he has been given benzos in the recent past during detox, it has always been under medical supervision as an inpatient, never has he been given benzos as a RX or pills to take as an outpt. I support that kind of use. They hand him a pill and stand there and watch him take it. As soon as he is well enough to be discharged they do so. They do not give him benzos to take outside of the clinic setting. Again, alcohol detox is a totally different animal than opiate detox. One should not drive while taking opiates until one knows exactly how one will respond to them, same as other drugs, and then only where it is legal of course. If you are parking your car in the middle of the street, you are also showing other types of behavioural changes, better to find out before you drive a car. I believe that people who take any new drug should let a family member/close friend know so that any personality changes are noted by someone else, and you can discuss them with your doctor. If one read all the side effects possible with any medicine, one would not take it if they assumed they would get ALL the side effects. Many people get no side effects at all, or only ones that can be dealt with. We agree on lots of things and disagree on some. Makes for a lively discussion. Take care, Annette""I did not look back through your posts to figure out what all you are taking, but medications with sedating side effects often have a correlation to falling. Like the benzos do. Your doctor has to see you at least twice a year to hand you RXs, please discuss this with him. Or see some one at a free/low cost clinic. Take care, Annette""Personally, I would find a doctor before I moved. Just like when I was working, I always found a job first, then moved. Now, I would find a doctor first, then move. Take care, Anentte""MRIs are not always the best way to diagnose things that require pain meds. I think your long relationship with the same doctors is a better reference. Take care, Annette""Do you belong to this program, how much do you pay per month to belong? Take care, Annette""You are in college now, and you have discovered chronic pain already. It is a shame to start out so young. Go see a pain management specialist, and use every single resource available to you, not just opiate pain pills. All you mention is using narcotic pain pills, there are many different therapies to try and each may give you a small amount of relief. Keep at it, and together they may give you significant relief. Most folks in chronic pain will never be pain free, but they should be able to lower their pain levels enough to cope well with what life throws at them. All you say in your post is that you have pain and you want drugs to deal with it. We don<APO>t even know what kind of pain you have, there may be someone here with similar problems who has more specific suggestions to help you. If you feel comfortable with it, tell us a bit more. There are two books that I highly recommend for you to read, ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns, MD, and ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"", by Dr. Margaret Caudill, MD, PhD. After you read them both clear through, pick out whatever seems that it might help you, or do the whole program. They even have worksheets in the back that you can copy and use to check your progress. This takes a lot more work than popping a pill, but they saved my life and I continue to plug them whenever I can. You can get them both through any large book store for less than $30 apiece. Take care, Annette""I would see another orthopedic doctor who specializes in hips and get a second opinion. If that didn<APO>t take me anywhere, I would see a neurologist about the pain and numbness, it may not be permanent. Another option is to see a pain management specialist. Best of luck to you. Keep in touch. Take care, Annette""Not everyone had that prosthesis put in that was recalled. My husband had hip replacement surgery and we worried after reading about the one that was recalled. He called his surgeon and he told us that he didn<APO>t use that type at all, so not to worry. I would ask the doctor who did the original surgery if he used the type of hardware that was recalled. Take care, Annette""Diesel15, I replied to you based on that scenario, I assumed if you had a THR you would have said so, and you did not. My reply to piochrobert was in regards to hip replacements because there was a specific hip prothesis that was recalled recently. This whole system of posts and replies can be very confusing. Take care, Annette""Congrats on the new baby! I would ask the OB-GYN for another referral for this problem. Ditto with the PM doctor. See what kind of suggestion they give you. Make sure that this is not a GYN kind of problem by getting a second opinion for that, then I would see a PM doctor that deals with PM techniques in addition to procedures and injections, things like oral meds, opiates, biofeedback, PT, OT, cognitive behavioural therapy, heat/cold, massage, etc. Ask before you make the appt. what kinds of treatments they do. Since you have already gone the interventional road of nerve blocks, etc. try the non-interventional road. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know what you are talking about, I would ask for the name of the procedure, how often he does it for other patients with your diagnosis, and what his success rate is, and also what his adverse effect rate is. Make him define success for you, we as patients often think ""pain free"" means success, but many doctors think if your pain is relieved by 50% the procedure is successful. Be sure you are all thinking on the same page. Take care, Annette""Thanks, Swank. I will try Googling it. Take care, Annette""Sorry, he is having so much trouble. I would suggest he try a low income or free clinic depending on where he is with the insurance. Do a search on the internet for clinics in your area. If he has any insurance at all, they should be able to give you a list of providers. If his testes are swollen, I would get him to the ER if nothing else. That can be other things besides his chronic conditions. Take care, Annette""As long as you drift into the other lane while driving, you ARE putting others in danger. It may be inconvenient for you to stop driving, but you can do it. If your car blew up and you had no means to get another, you would not be driving. I had to stop for awhile, it stunk, but it was possible. I had migraines that caused similar symptoms, that is when my doctor told me either don<APO>t drive, or he would report me to the DMV. I did not drive until he cleared me. I scheduled appts. around when I could get a ride with someone else. With migraines, I would continue seeing the specialist. I found that changing meds, taking two or three together, whatever, it took a long time to figure things out, but one does. I would stick to one doctor in your situation and let him approve all the meds I took. My internist does that now. Take care, Annette""My doctor and my husband are the only ones that need to know anything about my pain. I really do not think it is helpful to tell acquaintances or co-workers about health issues at all. Just my opinion. Hugs, Annette""The husband has been there for many, many years, lol, but I have changed doctors several times since developing FMS, and I have to say I have never had even a whisper of trouble as far as them not wanting to treat my pain or not believing I had pain. I don<APO>t have the same experience as some others on this board have had that way. Not sure why. Hugs, Annette""I would try what he gives you and make sure you get back to him promptly and let him know that they aren<APO>t working well for you. Trust has to develop on both sides for him to prescribe you opiates if that is what you are after. It sounds as if you only just met this guy. Make sure he has your medical records and give him a bit of time to read them. My advice is too late for you, but for others, if possible I would set things up with a doctor before moving just like I would have with a new job some years back. I don<APO>t think I would move until I found a doctor in the new area that I liked. Take care, Annette""Go back to the same doctor, it sounds like she was a good fit for you. Scoliosis is something that requires ongoing medical care, and only your treating doctor can tell what might be in store for you later. Take care, Annette""Hi, Charles As I read her post, the back pain is caused by scoliosis, which is idiopathic in nature. Perhaps I read it wrong, communicating in writing without being able to see each other lends to misunderstandings. Take care, Annette""Thank you for your military service. If you are taking the maximum doses or ibuprofen and paracetamol and you are still having terrible pain, it is time to see a doctor. Perhaps you could be seen by a VA doctor or go to a low cost/free clinic in your area? I am a bit confused as to why you would take a RX for a drug that you already had and knew would not work? Did you tell him it didn<APO>t work and you already had some, what did he say? Take care, Annette""I would go to my pcp and make sure there is not anything else wrong and see what she said to try next. Take care, Annette""I have no idea what she has, but I would discourage her from sitting on a heating pad. Most of them will get much hotter than intended and actually burn the skin when sat upon. Read the instructions or call the maker and ask. I hesitate to say there are none out there that is safe used this way, one may have been invented lately. Please check. Take care, Annette""Get her leg problem diagnosed before she has surgery!!! Get another opinion, have her see an infectious disease specialist. Maybe she had H. Zoster, maybe she burned her leg putting a heating pad on it and the blisters never healed properly. Who knows, but if she has any active infection, from Herpes, or anything else, it could cause an infection in any surgical site. This can be really dangerous if they cut any bone. Is she cognizant, what does she say about having spinal surgery? Where is her pain, does it follow a specific dermatome? Can she move if she wants to? What do you mean when you say she doesn<APO>t tolerate high (what is high?) doses of opioids well? Are you aware that fentanyl (the medicine in pain patches) is an opioid? It sounds like you need to talk to her with her doctor and see what the answers to all these questions are. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know what is best for her. Is she competent mentally? If not, do you have a medical power of attorney for her? Was she aware that you were prescribing the Valtrex kind of behind her doctor<APO>s back? If she really disagreed with him about that, why didn<APO>t you restart and complete the course of Valtrex immediately? I know it is hard to deal with a frail, ill mom, I did that years back when my mom died of cancer. She signed all the power of attorney papers for her medical care while she was still able to do so, just in case. Since your mom is 84 and facing surgery, that is probably a conversation you should have with her now, if you haven<APO>t already. Take care, Annette""Have the blisters on her leg completely healed by now? One concern I have is for infection if she has surgery of any kind if she has open wounds on the skin of her leg. As for diagnosing the cause of her pain, would an EMG be useful? Perhaps that would tell you whether the pain was coming from the spine or the skin lesions. Is she cognizant? Is she alert enough and together enough to make her own medical decisions? I think that is also important. Good luck to you both. Take care, Annette""Since she has not had any new lesions for two weeks, if it is Herpes then all the lesions should be scabbed over by now. Is she healing well? I am not there of course, but with Herpes Zoster, where I live it is usually treated with antivirals within the first 72 hours of the onset of symptoms. Since the doctor did not even see her until 2 weeks after the symptoms began I would accept that he did the medically appropriate thing. At least in my community. If it is Herpes Zoster. I would check the EMG results and see what they show, perhaps they will shed some light on her case. Is she mentally competent to make her own medical decisions? Take care, Annette""I am sorry, I am a little confused. You posted earlier that the treating doctor refused to give her anti-virals, but now you are saying she got the Valtrex (an antiviral), who prescribed it for her? I have not heard of anything related to using or not using antivirals based on whether or not ""new"" lesions were appearing in Herpes Zoster. My nursing drug book suggests that caution be used in prescribing this medicine to elderly people. If you gave it to her without saying anything to the doctors, it is time to come clean with them. Be honest with the doctors, particularly if she is to go to surgery soon. I am not sure that one should call this pain ""post Herpetic neuralgia"", PHN is usually diagnosed after all the skin lesions are gone entirely, but pain remains. From what you describe she would still have Herpes Zoster, if indeed that is what she has. I don<APO>t know that. Take care, Annette""While you are deciding, try using a 5 iron (golf club) upside down for a cane. My husband did this while he was waiting for his hip replacement for AVN, and he got lots of conversation from it, and very little sympathy. I bought rubber walker tips at the drug store and he put one of them on the end rather than wear it out. Make sure you get properly sized and fitted for the right length for whatever you use for a cane, and learn how to use it properly by a PT. Don<APO>t just go to the store and buy one, it is far more complicated than that. I am a retired nurse, so I did lots of research regarding a hip surgeon, I suggest you do the same. Find a surgeon who does 4-5 hip replacements a week if possible. I found three or four in our city after talking to other nurses. Ask him what his infection rate is, and what his rate of other complications is. It is a major investment in your time, money, and your life in general. Take care, Annette""I have been to two different pain clinics at different stages of my illness. I believe there are basically two different kinds of clinics out there. The first kind pretty much limits their treatments to injections and procedures. I went to one of these early on after my fibromyalgia was diagnosed. I declined the proposed injections. My pcp and I agreed they would probably not be very beneficial. Much later on, I went to the other kind of pain clinic. They used many different kinds of treatments including injections and procedures, but also used PT, OT, psychotherapy, biofeedback, acupuncture, oral meds including opiates, and other treatments as well. They seemed to look at the whole person and designed specific treatment plans for each person with various therapies. Unfortunately for me, he agreed with what my rheumatologist was already doing and had nothing more to offer me at that point but reassurance that I was in good hands. I feel that if you can get some small relief from each of several therapies, and continue to do them all, significant relief can often be attained. Anyone who thinks just taking a narcotic will cure them is likely to be unsuccessful in attaining decent pain levels. It is hard work, and we may be doing it for the rest of our lives. I really believe in going to the second kind of clinic if your primary care doctor is unable to manage your pain successfully. Generally speaking I have been lucky in that my pain has been managed as well as can be expected without needing a pain management specialist. My pcps have been wonderful. I would ask the pain management clinic what kinds of therapies they use, and be sure they are in line with what you and your pcp think would be useful in your case. Spending a lot of money for a first visit only to discover they will not provide what you need is a total waste of money, time and energy. You have to ask them how long it would take to get an appt. I have never heard of a waiting list, but some doctors are busier than others, and it takes longer to get an appt. A doctor can decline to see any patient for any reason, this is uncommon though. Some doctors do not take any new patients because they are busy enough. Usually, they are either taking new patients or they aren<APO>t, you should find out when you call to make an appt. You also need to check with your insurance company. Mine does not require a referral from a primary care doctor, but some insurance companies do. Some specialists also do not take new patients without a referral from a pcp. I always check with friends and family before seeing a new doctor. I try to check them out as much as I can before seeing them. Good luck in this endeavor. Take care, Annette""Is there a specific question you would like answered? When did you fall in relation to when you took meds? Are you on any other meds? What non-drug techniques for pain management do you use? I don<APO>t really have enough information to offer any suggestions. Take care, Annette""Hi, Laura You have to decide what is right for you. My Internist/pcp has always managed my pain meds, I am more than happy with her care. When it was time for me to go to a long acting opiate she offered me Duragesic (transdermal fentanyl) or Oxycontin. She was happy to write me a RX for long acting generic morphine, when I gave her good reasons why I wanted to go with that option instead. We talked about it for quite awhile. I was a long term FMS patient by the time I saw her so I already knew all the non-drug options and used those that were helpful. My old family practice doc, also my pcp, had originally diagnosed me and guided me through all that stuff. I moved out of state or I would have stayed with him. I have seen three PM specialists over the years, maybe one or two of those three would have been useful had I not already been seeing good doctors. I saw them strictly as consultants to see if there was anything else I could do. One was totally into just sticking needles into me, and billing the insurance company. I don<APO>t think she really cared where she stuck them. I never gave her the opportunity to actually do it. The other two are both good guys, and seemed to know what they were talking about. Both were impressed with the care I was already getting. If I were you, I would read and do lots of research about FMS for yourself. Go to good medical sources, not trashy sites, print out anything that you would like to find out about and present them to your pcp. See how much interest he shows. Then you have to decide. Take care, Annette""It is my understanding that a bulging disc is the same as a protrusion, as you posted. The disc is bulging from between the two vertebrae surrounding it, one above it and one below it. But, in my understanding, a disc extrusion is different because the tough membrane covering the disc has broken open and the gelatinous material inside the disc had begun leaking out, that would be the same as a herniation or rupture. A disc is like a pillow in that it has a covering (the cloth shell) and goo in the middle (like feathers). The disc provides cushioning between the vertebral bones of the spine. Some degeneration of the discs is normal as time goes on. The discs become a little dry, and flatter. Sometimes they bulge out between the bones, sometimes they herniate and the goo in the center leaks where it should not go. Think of a hernia in the abdomen, it is a hole in the membrane that encases the abdominal contents. As the hole gets larger the intestines might pop out in a small loop through the hole. A herniated disc is a hole in the membrane encompassing the disc. So, an MRI report that says there is one disc bulging and one disc that has ruptured, would not mean that there were two herniated discs only one. The MRI report is done by a radiologist just looking at the films he hasn<APO>t seen you or taken your history. A neurologist, neurosurgeon, orthopedist, etc. that has looked at the films AND has examined you and taken a history may differ in his opinion. I would trust your neurologist or neurosurgeon more than I would trust a radiologist. I would discuss your MRIs and other tests with your own doctor if I were you. The radiologist<APO>s report is not always accurate. They tend to over-diagnose to cover their own butts, in my humble opinion. Take care, Annette""ALL adult humans develop disc degeneration as they mature. My neurosurgeon told me it is part of standing erect. The discs take a lot more gravity from our weight than if we were not an erect species. How bad the DDD is is what matters at any age. What symptoms one develops is what ususally leads us to the doctor. I had an MRI of my cervical spine because I could feel a swelling on the side of my neck. I showed it to my doctor and he ordered the test. The swelling was nothing, but he told me that ""by the way"" my cervical spine looked like it was 90 years old. ALL the discs were a mess, one was herniated, and the rest were bulging. One not only indented my thecal sac, it indented my spinal cord. My pcp offered to send me to a surgeon, I said no, thanks, surgeons cut and I was not ready for that. A couple of years later I started dropping glasses and other objects with my dominant hand, and then I asked for a referral to a neurosurgeon and a neurologist. I had never had pain in my neck, only in my arms late in the game. I finally had the one disc removed, the two vertebrae fused naturally over 5-6 months as was the neurosurgeon<APO>s plan. Six months later the next disc up towards my head from the operative site herniated, I decided not to go back to surgery. That was in 1992, I don<APO>t regret it one bit. I have some residual numbness in my arms/hands when my neck is in a certain position, flexed towards my chest for more than a few minutes. T-spine is fine and L-spine had one bulging disc years ago per MRIs. I have not had an MRI of any part of my spine for about 15 years. MRIs have not been shown to be a good indicator of whether or not one needs disc surgery, I will wait until I have some kind of symptoms or change in symptoms. Just my personal choice. I still say stay in the care of a good doctor, do your research before you let them do anything to you, and make up your own minds what to do with your own bodies. Take care, Annette""I believe I said a herniation and a ruptured disc were the same thing, the outer covering of the disc was broken open. With a bulging disc the outer covering was still intact but the disc was bulging out of position. I personally do not use WebMD anymore for research because I found incorrect material years ago, probably due to a typo, and when I reported it to them they told me they had a contract with the folks who provided the info and they were not allowed to change it. If WebMD says that bulges and ruptures are both considered herniations, I feel they are incorrect. I don<APO>t think it would be too much to ask, if you requested more pain meds for the last bit of time before you get your epidural. I have not had any problems increasing and decreasing my meds depending on how bad my pain is. If your doctor knows you don<APO>t need as much for the first two months after the epidural, I don<APO>t think he would have a problem with giving you more for that one month or so??? I do understand why they make you wait three months to have another injection, mainly because I know what is in the injection, taking it too often could do more harm than good for your body. Take care, Annette""Like I said in my above post, talk to your doctor about this. I feel it would be safer for you to take more opiates during that time than it is to double up on your valium. Take care, Annette""I would not ask for any med specifically. I would tell the doctor what kinds of things in your life the pain is preventing you from doing. Focus on function rather than pain. Have specific goals for him, and then let him suggest treatments to you. Be open to trying things that he suggests. If he has no answers for you, ask hm to refer you to another doctor who might offer you more help. Take care, Annette""Hi, Kelly A herniated disc and a ruptured disc are the same thing, just two different ways of saying it. Having a surgeon suggest surgery for a single herniated disc is not uncommon, but if you have several near each other they often do not suggest surgery. It also depends on where in your spine they are located, what kinds of symptoms you are having, and what kind of doctor you go see. I had a discectomy that fused naturally for a herniated cervical disc that caused functional deficits in 1992. My surgeon said he would not do any kind of spinal disc surgery for herniated discs that were causing pain, but not a functional deficit. He felt that the possible benefit/risk ratio was too poor. Take care, Annette""Let the doctor know how difficult it is for you during this short time, I am sure he will adjust your meds for you I think it is great just that you are still working, I would let him know that it also affects your ability to continue employment. Take care, Annette""Hi, Pesky I don<APO>t myself recommend mixing benzos and opiates because of the possible side effects when they interact. However, everyone decides this with their own doctor. I give what I know about these things freely, but everyone needs to make up their own minds about what they take and how. Valium has been used for decades for muscle relaxation and anxiety both. Many people use it along with opiates to get better control of their symptoms, especially back pain. It seems that 2 2=6 instead of 4, when valium is used with opiates in some people. When I graduated from nursing school in 1970 it was the most widely prescribed drug in the world. Not anymore. Now there are other drugs with fewer side effects. But with some folks it does seem to work better than the newer drugs. Same thing with Darvocet, now withdrawn from the market entirely. We all learn from reading here, I come for just that reason. My feelings aren<APO>t hurt at all if someone disagrees with me, that is just part of the way the world works. Kelly is aware of the benefits and risks of all of her meds, as we all should be. She chooses to use what she takes just like we do, with the benefit of a good doctor<APO>s input. Her choices are different from mine, but it doesn<APO>t bother me at all. What works for one person may not work for another. Take care, Annette""Hi, Kelly I am so sorry if I offended you in any way. Please read my response to Pesky too. Just because I would not choose to use benzos and opiates together, does not mean I should have control over what you and your doctor decide is best for you, much less come down on you about it. That was certainly not my intent. I like to inform people, but they make their own choices. If we disagree on this topic, it is no big deal to me, please don<APO>t let it be for you. Anyone who comes here, can read both sides and come to any conclusion they want to. I hope they would discuss it with their doctor. I guess they would have to, seeing as this is a RX med. I have never thought of you as someone who would abuse their drugs. Hugs, Annette""I would show the doctor the bruise on your leg and let him decide how serious to take it. Any bruise that big is worth keeping an eye on. If you have any pain in your leg below the bruise, or redness or swelling be sure to get it checked out right away. Same thing with any shortness of breath or chest pain. Traveling clots are not frequent followers of bad bruising, but it can happen. When you go to see your doctor, discuss the situation with the pain meds. It sounds like taking the MS Contin every 8 hours might be better for you than every 12 hours. I don<APO>t think he is laying a trap for you when he asks you which drug you want to adjust, I think he is just asking your opinion. We would not even be having this conversation if it was blood pressure medicine, would we? My doctor will say the same kind of thing to me, I treat it as matter-of-factly as any other kind of medicine. I use function more than pain as an opener with my doctor. I tell her what I want to be able to do that I cannot do now because of pain, then I wait for her to respond. I have found all doctors, mine included, have good days and bad days like the rest of us. I probably save the harder questions for ""good days"", lol. You might also keep a written record for a couple of weeks of when you take your pain meds, show it to him and ask him if it seems reasonable to him the way you are doing it. Before my surgery I was using my BT meds more like just part of my daily med routine. My surgeon sent me to a PM specialist that I had seen only once before in advance of my surgery. When I told him how I was using my meds he picked up on that right away and commented on it. He did not put me down or anything, he just made suggestions for how to approach pain after the surgery. I knew he was right, I have adjusted things somewhat since the surgery. I take half the methadone I took when I saw him and use the same BT med but much differently. Take care, Annette PS, The most common side effect of valium and opiates is falling down, be very careful at night especially if you have to get up out of bed. Do not do it quickly, sit on the side of the bed long enough to really get your bearings. Breaking bones is only one problem with falls in women.""Hi, Kelly Girl, you are a broken hip waiting to happen, LOL!!! All your meds, and brittle bones too!!! Please be very careful moving around half asleep at night. If you usually get up at night to use the bathroom, set that as one time to take pills. I keep my meds and a bottle or water on my night stand, and take my early morning meds then. I consider pain meds on time if taken within one hour of when I should take them. If it is a couple of hours or more, then I adjust my next dose accordingly. After my meds, I go back to bed for another couple of hours and try to sleep a bit more. I get a total of 5-6 hours of good sleep a night. I don<APO>t think there are any 75 mile per hour zones in my state, but a police officer behind me would always bring stress into my day. I just got new neighbors too, I went over and introduced myself, a single mom with a couple of daughters. Hopefully, all will go well. You have had a rough week. Bruising is actually blood in your tissue from broken blood vessels. Usually they heal fine on their own, but with all your medical problems, it is good to stay on top of these things and just be aware. Blood clots are very rare, but a possible complication. My friend just had a very bad bruise and that is what her doctor told her. Take care of your self. Hugs, Annette""I know states are allowed to set their own speed limits. I have lived in three states but all out here in the far West. 70 has been the highest so far. I don<APO>t really function well on 5-6 hours of sleep. I need 8 hours to really feel good, just haven<APO>t been able to sleep that long in many years. If I could I bet my pain levels would go down some. Do your best to sleep as much as you can each night, the studies show that sleep is one thing we can<APO>t make up for later on, like sleeping late on the weekends. Losing sleep does subtle damage to our bodies as we go along. I really believe that working nights and skimping on sleep when I was younger caused the health issues I have now. Take care, Annette""You are welcome. I WAS the night nurse most of my career. We don<APO>t get to lay down and sleep when it is quiet. Most nurses love their jobs, I did mine, otherwise we couldn<APO>t/wouldn<APO>t do them. It certainly was not for the money, I hope that improves with time. There is something to be said for retirement, whatever the reason. Less money, but more time. Take care, Annette""I am not clear on what throat and stomach problems you wish to avoid by not taking oral pain meds??? They don<APO>t cause Barrett<APO>s Esophagitis, and the nausea that they can cause is usually transitory and goes away after a few weeks at most. As long as you are eating or using a gastric tube for your food and meds, I think your oral pain meds can still be taken. Check with your pharmacist to be sure. Usually med pumps and SCS devices do not absolutely remove the need for oral meds, they just decrease the amount necessary. I would personally avoid any invasive procedures unless the doctor tells you that you are not able to use oral or topical meds anymore due to either side effects of because they no longer work. I am somewhat conservative and try to avoid any surgical procedures as long as possible. Do your own research and see what you can find. Take care, Annette""Diabetes is another reason to avoid surgery unless it is absolutely necessary. It is an increased risk for anyone having surgery. Take care, Annette""I assume you have taken meds for gastric reflux without relief. I had not heard of opiates causing this problem before. How are you eating if you can<APO>t swallow sometimes? It is really important to maintain your nutritional status with your other health issues. Some folks have posted here that they have used a nasal steroid spray like Nasonex on clean skin, then let it dry and apply the fentanyl patch. This prevents the topical reaction to the adhesive. Of course, you need a RX for the spray, so discuss it with your doctor if you think it is worth trying. Best of luck whatever you decide. Take care, Annette""High blood pressure can be caused by many things. But, regardless of the cause it needs to come down before it does any damage. High blood pressure can cause heart attacks, strokes, and kidney failure to name just a few of the serious problems it is connected with. As a nurse, high blood pressure and the importance of treating it early on, was one of the things I was very aware of. High blood pressure is anything over 140/90. If either number is higher than that it counts as high blood pressure, even if the other number is within normal limits. High blood pressure is not diagnosed based on only one or two readings. Usually the doctor needs several readings to make a diagnosis. Whatever is causing it, it must be treated as soon as possible. Being in pain makes it more difficult to figure out just what is causing the high blood pressure. Getting the pain under control, then checking the blood pressure again will give you some idea of what is going on. Same with stress, we all have some kind of stress in our lives, it is how we deal with it that is important. Try taking his blood pressure at home when he is as relaxed as possible, write down all the readings you get so you can pass them on to the doctor. Blood pressure monitors are available at most pharmacies, and are very easy to use. You can also take it when he is in pain to see if there is any difference. Acute pain can cause the blood pressure to rise, but not in all people. With chronic pain the body has learned to compensate somewhat, and in many people it does not affect the blood pressure at all. In other people, the blood pressure is affected. Blood pressure is not a reliable test to see if someone is in pain. Pain is not a necessarily the cause of elevated blood pressure. More investigation is needed. Some medications can cause blood pressure to rise in some people, the thing that the doctor would usually do is tell your hubby how to check his blood pressure in regards to the timing of his meds. He may need to check it prior to taking them, or even stop taking them for awhile before measuring his blood pressure. That is up to the doctor, your hubby shouldn<APO>t adjust his meds without supervision. Addiction is a specific medical problem just like high blood pressure is. It is defined as the compulsive use of a drug for reasons OTHER than what it was prescribed for, regardless of the negative influences on ones life. If your hubby is only taking the meds for pain, even if he takes too much, he is not likely addicted. If he is taking the meds to get high, that is a different story. All of us who take pain meds on a daily basis are likely dependent on them, but that is different than addiction. Many other types of meds also cause dependence. That just means if we go off of them, we should taper off slowly to avoid withdrawal symptoms. The good thing about opiates is they don<APO>t seem to cause any organ damage even if you take them for many years. Tylenol on the other hand can cause liver damage if taken incorrectly. Most kinds of hydrocodone include tylenol, so your hubby needs to be careful of how much tylenol he takes in addition to his pain meds. He should not take over 4000 mg. of tylenol per day according to the tylenol label. Some recent research suggests it would be wise not to take more than 2000 mg. per day if you are taking it long term. He should discuss this with his doctor. My doctor does regular liver function tests on me to watch for any problems. He should certainly not drink any alcohol while taking tylenol in any form. Too much Advil (ibuprofen) can cause bleeding in the stomach, it would be wise to let the doctor know how much of this he is taking also. The doctor can tell him the warning signs of taking too much. He is lucky to have a wife that is so caring and is trying to gather information to help him. Take care, Annette""Private is different than secret, in my humble opinion. My experience with Al-Anon has been less than stellar. AA and NA are certainly not anonymous when I read the above posts. Thank goodness, I guess, for the people they do help, but I would suggest a real therapist with training in both addiction and pain management. My brother went through an alcoholic recovery class at Kaiser and he once told me I was a drug addict because I took pain meds as directed for pain by my doctor. I spoke to his therapist who had no experience with chronic pain patients at all, and he told me they taught that use of any narcotic was a big no-no, and ALL users where addicts, and in the same sentence he would tell me I was clearly not an addict. I could see why my brother was confused. They made no distinction between addiction and dependence at all. I am much more in fear of addiction than I am of chronic pain. I have so much respect for anyone, you included, who have conquered addiction. Do whatever works for you. Take care, Annette""What does the prescribing doctor say about all of this? Did you have a hospitalist or did your own doctor take care of you in the hospital? Methadone and/or Nucynta withdrawal doesn<APO>t cause the low hemoglobin or your iron level, at least not that I am aware of. If they admitted you for the lab values, were they corrected or were you under treatment for that when you went home? How long were you in the hospital for? Your discharge papers should have the final diagnosis written on them, what does it say? Tell your prescribing doctor about the ""twitches"" that have continued. Are you having any other symptoms? That could be from withdrawal from the drugs that you were on. If the benzo you are taking does not work for the ""twitches"", you might discuss not taking it at all with your doctor. What is the point? I don<APO>t really understand why you had to go to a methadone clinic to get methadone, my pcp prescribes mine. It is really cheap that way. My insurance covers the medicine, but it is really cheap even if you have to pay for it yourself. Around $30 a month or so. Far cheaper than Vicodin or Nucynta. One day off of methadone does not start withdrawal symptoms, so the timing is strange for methadone withdrawal. Did any doctor think you had Serotonin Syndrome? Was that a diagnosis on your discharge papers? Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Hi, Debb60 My family doctor told me about Serotonin Syndrome about 18 years ago when he added a drug to my regimen that could trigger it. He warned me about the symptoms, told me to stop taking the two meds that could contribute to it that I was on, and call him immediately if I developed any of the symptoms. I am an old retired RN, and we all knew about it in the ER where I worked at that time. Maybe it is a geographical thing like many medical issues are. Take care, Annette""Hi Grace, this is for everyone not just you! If you exchange phone numbers through a private email acct. that is okay, if you wish to. However, it is very unwise to put them anywhere on line. My phone number is unlisted, no one gets it outside of friends and family. Think of an on line message board like you would a bulletin board outside the grocery store in your area, don<APO>t put up anything that you would feel strange putting up there in writing for everyone to see. Take care, Annette""Hi, Grace There are a few antidepressants that are meant to be used for chronic pain management, not just depression. My husband has been on a couple of them in the past when he was being treated for chronic hip pain. He had no side effects from them. The serotonin is a neurotransmitter that helps transmit both mood signals and pain signals. It is thought that by increasing this neurotransmitter it may not only improve mood, but it may also help manage pain signals. Take care, Annette""Cymbalta was one of them, I can<APO>t remember the other one. It doesn<APO>t really matter, because what works for one person may or may not work for another. It was an SSRI. I think almost all the antidepressants increase the serum serotonin somewhat. That is also what the Imitrex does. You do have to be very careful. Back in the ""olden days"" I took an SSRI and still used Imitrex two or three times a week (way more than the company who makes it recommends). My doctor warned me about Serotonin Syndrome and explained the symptoms to me, and left it up to me. For me both were for migraines, and I was willing to be a guinea pig. Take care, Annette""I vote for volunteering! I have done that for many years, as did my mom. Both before and after becoming disabled. I found out there are even things we can do from home on our computers or telephones. Take care, Annette""Not really better, just cheaper and they work for me. I take compazine 10 mg. in pill form every six hours as needed. A doctor I worked with in Nevada in the ER gave me an article about using compazine in the ER for migraines (not just for the nausea) but they used it IV. The doctor was great and knew I had migraines. I tried it in the ER and it worked fine, so I asked my doctor if he would prescribe pills for me so I could use it at home. It works as well, but takes a little bit longer to work by mouth of course. But not as long as it takes to drive to the ER, sign in, etc. I also use reglan 10 mg. with aspirin 975 mg. (three regular size adult aspirin) by mouth. I had read about this in a smaller study in Europe I think. It was years ago. They had good reasons why it might work, too long and complicated to go into here, so I gave it a try. Reglan is an old, old drug with few side effects. I have also used it with ibuprofen 800 mg. when I could not find any aspirin at home. It still works fine. I alternate these two and whatever ""triptan"" type drug I have at home if I get more than three migraines a week. I go straight to the triptan if I wake up with a migraine, as I know from experience that works for these types of migraines for me. I continue to get migraines and use the reglan mix first, then the compazine, then the triptan. All of these drugs can be used the same day as they are from different families of drugs. No horrible interactions according to my doctors and pharmacists. Discuss it with your doctor. Take care, Annette""Talk to your doctor about the headaches, and be open to trying whatever anyone offers you. I really think that believing in a med is necessary to having it work well. If you are sure it won<APO>t work, it probably won<APO>t. Excedrin Migraine is probably the same as regular Excedrine. Look on the label of active ingredients to see. I know Adivl is the same as Advil Migraine. I an very cynical and I bet they are all that way, lol. ""Pain"" meds tend to not be a good thing for headaches, as they can cause rebound headaches. Most doctors don<APO>t offer opiates any more for headaches. Whatever you take, take it right at the onset of the headache, not later on. It will work better the sooner you take it. Take care, Annette""I have read medical studies that showed plain caffeine helped some people with many kinds of headaches, including migraine. I will check the labels next time I am in the store, they (Excedrin and Excedrine Migraine) used to have the same ingredients, maybe not anymore. I read the labels when they first came out, but have not read them recently. My old doctor told me in case of an emergency type headache on the road to take any full strength caffeine pill I could get at a truck stop. Vivarin, or something like that. He told me it might help until I could stop driving for good without making me sleepy like many of my other pills for migraines did. That was before they invented triptan type drugs. Take care, Annette""One of the withdrawal symptoms of caffeine is a killer headaches. So it is very hard to tell without the doctor really evaluating you and doing a careful history, whether you are getting headaches due to a drop in your caffeine levels, or if the caffeine is treating a headache. Caffeine does not seems to matter as a part of my diet whether I get headaches or not. Unfortunately, it did not help much with headaches either, when I tried what my doctor suggested. I have heard of a hot beverage being used for constipation, people say it works. Hot tea or hot coffee, even hot water (yuck). Take care, Annette""I am so sorry, I must have misunderstood you, I thought you were talking about Excedrine and Excedrine Migraine. Plain Aspirin does not have caffeine in it. Opiates do not work that well for lots of people, not just recovering addicts, and lots of different types of pain. Keep trying different things. People suffer under the misconception that pain is pain and opiate pain pills will work no matter what, if you just get a high enough dose. They don<APO>t. It is really nice to have you here, and to have your perspective on things. Take care, Annette""Perhaps rather than do AA/NA you should see an addiction specialist that works with chronic pain patients on narcotic meds?? You could share your feelings in a safe place. Take care, Annette""Savella and nortriptyline are both antidepressants. Topiramate and gabapentin are both anti-seizure meds. Does your doctor stop meds that don<APO>t work, or just add more? I am not saying you may not need them all, I am just asking? I am not sure about gastric bypass surgery as I have not had it myself. I do have FMS though, and an increase in any physical symptoms is common, I believe. My legs are also very sore, and I think I bruise easily (not from FMS). My doctor says I don<APO>t have any bleeding problems (she tested me for that) and that if I paid attention, I could probably identify why I got bruised. I think she is probably right. Take care, Annette""Hi, Grace I don<APO>t use any antidepressants anymore due to memory problems. I still can<APO>t recall much of anything of about three months, some years back. Anti-seizure meds seem to work better for me, and don<APO>t cause the memory problems that the other drugs did. Some doctors seem to just keep adding more meds, and never tell patients to stop taking anything. That happened to a friend of mine and when she took all her meds to be checked at an appt. in a paper bag, he got the message and went through them and told her to stop taking some of them. She did much better. I hope you are feeling better today. Take care, Annette""I totally agree with you. Take care, Annette""I wouldn<APO>t waste energy being alarmed, just go see your pcp and let him/her advise you as to what to do next. Do you have yearly checkups? When was the last time you saw your doc for a regular physical? They may all be totally unrelated to each other. It is hard to say with so little information. Your doctor will have your history and know more from examining you and doing any necessary lab work. Take care, Annette""Try doing a search on Google for a free/low cost clinic in your town. Call the county where you live and see what they know about. Check with Goodwill and Salvation Army. Best of luck to you, but you really need a doctor at this point. Take care, Annette""That is what I meant when I said you try several different things at once, then add up the benefits. You are taking opiates, and using Lidoderm patches. Are you taking any kind of anti-seizure medicine or an antidepressant? Are you doing stretches or exercises? Heat or cold applications? Take care, Annette""Ask for more help with the neuropathy, ask him if there is something else you can try and if he has no suggestions, ask for a referral to a pain management specialist who can help you. Make sure you see a PM doctor who does more than just interventions like injections and surgery. I feel if you get a small amount of relief from each of several treatments, they can combine into significant relief. There is PT, OT, biofeedback, CBT, massage, stretching, exercise, etc. There are many other anti-seizure meds that may help with the neuropathy, or antidepressants, or Lidoderm patches. Those are all used a lot for neuropathy. Take care, Annette""Best of luck to you. I hope things work out for you. Take care, Annette""The thing is you will not know what will work for you until you try it. We are all different and react differently to each kind of medicine. I really like the medical info at http://www.myalgia.com , I find it is sound and scientific. You might do some reading there, and print out the articles that seem to make sense to you, take them to your doctor to discuss. Take care, Annette""Our state and some others have high risk pools set up for folks with limited financial means. You can also check for the various drug companies, they may have a program that would help. It is tough all over the place these days. Take care, Annette""I would tell your doctor the truth, just be honest. Nothing works instantly, and it may be that you are not the person to care for your grandmother anymore. That depends on what exactly she needs you to do physically and how much that impacts your pain. Any pain meds that you are just starting out on require some adjusting over time, and the neurontin usually takes awhile to adjust to find the right dose for you also. Talk to your doctor. Take care, Annette""Discuss this with the doctor who ordered the tests that found the possible liver hemangioma. I am confused though because first you said the pain did go away, then at the end of the post, you said it hasn<APO>t gone away??? Take care, Annette""I have chronic pain from Fibromyalgia, and I also find that when I exercise I have less pain that when I don<APO>t. I had surgery in January and even just a couple of days without the exercise made my FMS pain go way up. Try and write down exactly what you feel and the whole history of the pain and the ultrasound, etc. Include dates when you can. Explain it all to the doctor and also write down any questions you have to ask him. I find if I don<APO>t write things down I forget or get them mixed up. Take care, Annette""I would call the manufacturer of this medicine and discuss this with one of their people in the adverse reaction part of their consumer<APO>s office, they have standard forms to fill out. Call your doctor who prescribed with treatment and ask him what he knows about all this be for you write that letter to the drug company. Be as detailed as you can be about what happened, and ask them what you should expect now. Take care, Annette""Or just call the doctor who wrote the RX and ask him why he gave it to you if it is only for men. Many people are unaware that once the FDA approves a drug for one thing, doctors can usually prescribe it for anything and at any dose. It sounds like he is just using it off label since the ER nurse explained to the patient that it is usually used for prostate problems. But, the only one who knows why he prescribed it is the doctor. Take care, Annette""I am glad you are feeling better. Those symptoms are really kind of vague, and could happen for a number of reasons medically that might be totally unrelated to the medicine. I have FMS also, I tried massage and it caused me so much pain that I finally stopped going. I could barely stand up after the last one and she was so gentle and careful with me. I cannot imagine having AVN of both hips on top of the FMS. The problem being, as you already know, that any kind of pain can trigger FMS amplification of the pain. It is really hard to figure out which kind of pain is from what source. But, as you get on with living you will figure it all out. I am 60 now, and I have a pretty good system worked out to manage my pain. My husband had AVN just in one hip and had it replaced a couple of years ago. He didn<APO>t tell anyone how bad it hurt either, I told his doctor to check out his hip because he yelled out in pain when he turned over at night. Even then it took a second examination before my husband really told him how bad it hurt and he got an xray. His femoral head was completely collapsed. The doctor said he didn<APO>t know how my husband was even walking, let alone working as a big truck mechanic. He had to wait another year before he got some other health issue cleared up and had the surgery. Best thing he ever did. But he was 65 not 33. I don<APO>t really think it matters which kind of long acting pain med you take, I believe it is more dose related. Fentanyl is potent, but they are using the smallest dose available for you. Talk to a PM specialist, ask all your questions, write them down before you go, and write down the answers as you go along. Remember, it is not an EMERGENCY, you can go home and do research or just think about things before you decide to do anything. I always ask my doctor for evidence based medical studies regarding anything she wants to do. She is not uptight about second opinions, no GOOD doctor should be. By the way, my favorite FMS website has great medical info about FMS, go to http://www.myalgia.com to read great articles by great doctors and other health care providers who manage patients with FMS. Take care, Annette""I would suggest you pick the doctor that you feel most comfortable with, and stick to him/her. See the doctor as often as necessary until things are going better. If you just stop seeing the doctor, he assumes you must be fine. Personally, I would opt for the rheumy or your pcp if you have a good relationship going there. Mainly because you are already taking vit. D, I am not sure what else the hemnotologist can do anyway. A high ANA does not necessarily mean you have widespread inflammation. Mine has been high all my adult life, and I am 60 now. There are false positive results in a significant number of people who do not have any chronic or acute inflammation. Do you have redness, visible swelling, or heat in any part of your body? Those are some physical signs of inflammation. Talk this over with the rheumy, he should know all about it. Your blood tests should have included a thyroid panel, was that normal? Take care, Annette""Unless you know the lingo, I would avoid doing your own medical research, you might make assumptions that are incorrect based on misinterpreting a word. Whenever a doctor gives you medicine to take you should probably ask him how long it should be before you see a result. Then you know if it really is doing no better, and when to go see him again. Many kinds of meds may take up to a month to cause a change in how you feel. I have FMS and none of the drugs I took specifically for FMS worked. When I broke it down to specific symptoms and treated those two (pain and lack of sleep) directly I saw an improvement. Everyone is different, FMS is a complicated syndrome, be prepared to try many things if that is what you have. I recommend keeping a journal of symptoms, and medicines. Do not rely on memory to figure out what works best. I don<APO>t think keeping a journal applies only to FMS, I think it would be helpful for many kinds of chronic illnesses. Most rheumatologists do not need to do a full 18 tender point exam to make a diagnosis of FMS. The history and physical is pretty clear, and if you have already had lab work to eliminate other illnesses it is even more clear. Often they sneak in some of the tender points while examining you and see if you jump in pain. Some of the more recent research suggests they eliminate the tender point exam completely. Take care, Annette""I personally would just report all these things to the pcp in charge. Let him/her decide what is worth worrying about. This only works if you trust your doctor of course. I am 60 now and my nails have never been so bad as they are now, they have ridges and split a lot, I don<APO>t know if it is related to FMS or not. I trust my pcp and she is not concerned so I just let it go. She said she would be happy to refer me to a dermatologist to check them out, so far I haven<APO>t bothered. I have noticed bruising off and on over the years, sometimes it seemed to come out of nowhere. My pcp tells me that a lot of women bump themselves and do not even notice, until the bruise pops up, then they can<APO>t remember doing anything to cause it. She checked my blood work to make sure everything was okay in that department. So, now I don<APO>t worry about it. The FMS can cause any pain to feel worse, I have read that it is a syndrome of amplification of pain. The pain seems to travel from place to place, without rhyme or reason. If pain persists or feels different to you, then I would ask the doctor to check it out. After a few more years, you may be able to tell the difference between FMS pain and other pain, or you may not, who knows. Whenever we are sick with anything, we pay more attention to our bodies. When I was in my 20s and healthier I ignored a lot of stuff that I did notice when I first got FMS. Now I am back to ignoring symptoms unless they really shout at me. I don<APO>t know which response is better, but it works for me to ignore stuff as long as possible. I really like http://www.myalgia.com for good medical info about FMS. Do some reading there and if you wonder about anything, either come back here, or better yet, print out the article and take it to your pcp to discuss. Take care, Annette""I would discus this with your doctor, tell him just what you said here. I looked it up in my nursing drug handbook, and it said it<APO>s labeled use was for depression, and the only un-labeled use it had listed was for PTSD treatment. That said, I have heard of it being used for a sleep aid but not for gastroparesis related nausea. Only your doctor can explain to you why he thought the drug would be useful in your particular case. Once a drug is FDA approved, in most cases a doctor can prescribe it for whatever he wishes to. Remeron is a tetracyclic antidepressant. I know some SSRI, SNRI, and tricyclic type antidepressants are used to treat chronic pain because they all seem to mediate serotonin one way or another, perhaps it might help in the same way. You could also discuss this with your pharmacist. He/she may also be able to tell you if it is some kind of withdrawal syndrome that is causing the pain. Be prepared to tell the pharmacist how much you were taking per day and for how long, and when you last dose was. This, along with when the symptoms started should be of use to him. Take care, Annette""This is an easy blood test, my doctor checked both my vitamin D and B12 levels. My D was low normal, so I take a supplement. I live in Oregon and we don<APO>t always have enough sun up here. It didn<APO>t make any difference in my pain. I have heard that a mere 20 minutes of sunlight a day, even through clouds, on ones arms and face without sunscreen is enough to make the body produce enough vit. D. Doctors recommended that this be done in the late afternoon to avoid mid-day sun on ones skin for cancer prevention reasons. Take care, Annette""Wearing a cervical collar for any length of time at all, even just a few days, will substantially lessen the strength of your neck muscles. These should not be used unless a doctor explains to you why, what is wrong with you, and how to use it safely. These collars are not to be used without seeing a doctor first. I have had neck problems for many, many years, I asked my pcp, my neurosurgeon, and my neurologist, and all three doctors told me ""NO!!!"", do not even think about it. The neurosurgeon said after certain types of spinal surgery a cervical collar is worn for a brief amount of time, but not for the type of surgery I had. Take care, Annette""Yes, yes, NO, why would I?, no. Those are my answers to your questions with bullets next to them. You are of an age to be concerned about menopause, but there are blood tests the doctors can do to find out if that is happening to you. That could explain the sweating, or not. I don<APO>t know why you are having ""gut pain"" and am not sure if you are having diarrhea or not. And you are diabetic, and anxious. You need to see your PCP and have an honest conversation with him. If you want off the oxycontin, discuss that with him also. Take care, Annette""First see your PCP, let him decide whether you need to look at this as a new injury or an extension of the old one. Explain the insurance problems to him or his office staff and see what they can do do deal with it for you. Your health comes first. Take care, Annette""Great idea, let us know how it goes. Take care, Annette""These are great things, far better than the old fashioned walkers of yesteryear. I went to a class recently for folks with chronic conditions, and several of the ladies there used these. I didn<APO>t know they were called ""rollators"", I learn something new every day. Thanks. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know anyone you just ""muscled through it"" without drugs. It does affect your body as you experience pain differently over time. It also shortens ones life, from what I have read. Probably due to extra stress on the body. Take care, Annette""That was what I assumed from you reluctance to use medicines, that you had a history of some kind of problems with them, often a history of drug abuse makes people decide not to use any medicines at all. There are non-opiate meds you can try in addition to other kinds of pain management treatment. There is much more available now than there was even ten years ago. Do some research on medical sites like Medscape, or the Mayo Clinic websites. If all else fails, I would suggest you see an addictions specialist that works with a pain management team. Sometimes if one has had a problematic history with stimulants they may be okay with opiates, and vice versa. Some people will abuse any kind of drugs that get them high. The studies I quoted earlier included recovering addicts of various types. I would not undertake any kind of medical treatment without being absolutely honest about your past problems with your doctors. Everyone is unique, but the pain is pretty much the same. Take care, Annette""Best of luck with your procedure. Take care, Annette""I am glad you have not had any obvious post procedure problems. Hope all continues to go well, and your pain levels are permanently reduced. Take care, Annette""Pain is not benign. It can cause chronic problems if not treated as promptly as possible. I don<APO>t know why you are against using drugs to decrease your pain levels. I am happy and have a good life, but I do use modern pharmaceuticals to control my chronic pain and insomnia. Take care, Annette""Not everyone gets side effects, there is no way of knowing if you will until you take the medicine. Addiction is actually rare among opiate users who follow their doctor<APO>s instructions on use for pain, less than 1% according to the latest study, 1-5% according to the study before that one. Nothing will eliminate my pain but the meds make life doable for me. Instead of pain levels up around 8-9 (on a 0-10 scale) all the time, they are 3-5 most times, with the occasional spike higher. The only side effect I get from pain meds is constipation, which I have been able to deal with so far. I have been taking opiates daily for well over 15 years. When I do develop ""vicious side effects"" or addiction, I will deal with them. So far so good. I would not take any medication without checking out the possible benefits/risks first. If you get horrible side effects from a drug, then you have to decide what to do next, same as the rest of us. Take care, Annette""I would try other techniques for controlling pain since medicines don<APO>t seem to work well for you. Try Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, massage, biofeedback, etc. Migraines, anxiety disorders and insomnia may all respond in a positive way to these things, particularly CBT. If you wanted to see a geneticist to check on the genetics of your problems with meds, do so, but they are expensive. I don<APO>t know if insurance will cover it or not. Take care, Annette""I have never heard of a pain pump for outpatient use that does not get surgically implanted, and ""mounts outside the body"". Can you tell us more or better yet, post a link to the manufacturers of this device? Thanks, Annette""Thank you I will go check it out. Take care, Annette""I went to the site you indicated, but all the pumps I found were implantable ones. The also sold the devices to remotely change the dose through your skin. Perhaps if you gave me the number/name of this product I could keep looking. Thanks, Annette""My doctor did a urine test that told her the amount of drug in my body, not just whether it was present or not. It would seem that if you told your doctor exactly when you took medication then he would be able to figure out if you metabolize the drug more quickly than other people do. My doctor is great, as have been other doctors I have been to. I never had a dud and I am 61 years old. Take care, Annette""Will your insurance cover it? I currently have Medicare, and am very happy with it at this point in my life. Usually, once Medicare will cover things, insurance companies follow. I really tend to question whether things that are not covered by Medicare or health insurance are truly helpful or not. A lot of tests offered on line are not covered by any kind of insurance. I would check the company out, and also the test, on Medscape or other medical references. I would really like to know as I also get migraines. Take care, Annette""My husband has tapered off of methadone twice in his life of 69 years, both times with no withdrawal symptoms at all. They were many years apart for different kinds of pain. He did not think it was hard to stop at all. He asked for it by name the second time around because it did work well for him. I am currently on methadone for chronic pain, I am also very happy with it. My personal feeling is that anyone who would lie to their doctor to get a higher dose, deserves whatever happens to them. Take care, Annette""I agree with Swank on this one. I would suggest a sport<APO>s medicine doctor and/or an orthopedic surgeon. Not every one understands how important exercise is to some folks. That said, running is VERY hard on your body, there is low impact cardio that you could switch to for now, as Swank suggested. If you are running five days a week, you are not resting. My husband had a brain bleed several years ago, and the ER doctor put him on light duty. Two weeks later at a follow up, a neurologist asked my husband how that was going, and my husband said fine. The doctor asked him what light duty meant to him and he said ""I don<APO>t lift anything over 100 pounds."" The neuro said that to a doctor that meant you didn<APO>t lift anything over 10 pounds. Maybe ""rest"" is relative too. Talk to a doctor about all of this. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know of any connection between mono and migraines. Mono can cause a fever for the first few weeks, that can trigger headaches. There is a simple blood test called the ""mono spot"" that can be done to diagnose mono. if there is a question, discuss it with your parents and ask the doctor to do it for you. Take care, Annette""If taking the birth control Pill decreases your migraines, except during the week that you take the dummy pills, the doctor can prescribe them for you to take the active pills every day and only stop to let yourself bleed once every three months, or whatever length of time the two of you agree on. This can prevent a lot of migraines over the course of a year. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t really understand what your present daily medications consist of as far as dosage??? What they are changing them to??? If you can give us the dosage and number of times per day you take a medicine it would be easier to follow. I have been on daily opiate therapy for about 15 years, and I take 5 mg. of methadone three times a day, and breakthrough meds as needed with a monthly limit. My personal opinion is that perhaps the narcotic pain meds do not work for the kind of pain you have. What are you taking/doing other than opioids and benzos? I have not heard of any new DEA rules, you can go to their website and check it out. You are correct that is a federal agency and its rules should apply to all of us. You have been given several months notice to find another doctor to manage your pain, how is that going? I suspect the doctor is cutting back your meds in an effort to get you to find another doctor, just my opinion. I am not really concerned about the opiate withdrawal, but the benzo withdrawal does concern me. I have never heard of anyone taking klonopin at 120 mg., is that what the 120-60 means or is that the number of pills you get per month???? How many mg. per day do you take? Benzo withdrawal can cause seizures, so you need to have a doctor managing that withdrawal carefully. Either this doctor or another one. Take care, Annette""My understanding of your post is that your doctor from the old PM clinic moved his practice to the new clinic where you are now a patient. (You also changed to the new clinic.) His new group practice may have specific rules about prescribing scheduled drugs for non-cancer chronic pain. My doctor originally was with a clinic down the street from where I live. She was the only doctor in that group who would prescribe opiates to chronic pain patients, she asked us all to please not request refills or RXs from the other doctors in her group. Their philosophy was so different that eventually she left and went into private practice. I followed her to her new place. She just joined another group this year, and I followed her again. She has been my pcp for over 15 years now. I really like her a lot. We fit well together. So far so good. I have only been to the new place once so far. I know that group practices (clinics) often have internal rules about some things. Perhaps pain meds is one at your doctor<APO>s new clinic. Please talk to him and ask him all these questions, he is the only one who knows why he is doing what he is doing. If you haven<APO>t yet done it, please get an EKG now and yearly since you are on methadone. Meanwhile ask around your circle of friends and family and see if any one doctor<APO>s name crops up frequently as a good doctor. After you talk to him many questions may be answered or not. But, I hope they are. Take care, Annette""According to your initial post they told you several months ago that your doctor was getting out of the PM business, and going into oncology. You said that he would follow you until you found a new doctor. I would guess that you have not found one and they are doing the decent thing by tapering you off of the meds rather than letting you suddenly go without while on such a high dose of everything. You have not mentioned being in withdrawal at all, or talked about continuing or worse pain, though I would imagine you would certainly have increased pain. However, not everyone has withdrawal symptoms when they lower narcotics. I have tapered my husband off of methadone twice and oxycodone twice also, at his request, he had no symptoms at all. His aches and pains came back but he wants to take OTC meds for now. He used to race dirt bikes (motorcycles), so he hurts in a lot of places that he previously injured, he is 67 now. He also tapered off of morphine and percocets after he had cancer, he told me he had no withdrawals then either, I wasn<APO>t around then. I cut my husband<APO>s doses by 50% once a week. I have cut my methadone dose by half since I had surgery last January. I didn<APO>t have withdrawals either. The one medical journal article that I read some years ago regarding opiate withdrawal suggested decreasing opiates by 50% of the total daily dose once a week, until you felt you could go totally off. They said that withdrawal symptoms should not be noticable if you stick to 50% decreases once a week, and that they could be treated with other medications specific for each symptom or with clonidine. As I told you before, I am much more concerned about the benzos you are on, klonopin. Sudden withdrawal from that med can cause seizures and tapering should always be followed by a doctor. I was only on 1 mg. once a day when I stopped taking it, I did not have a seizure, but I had major withrawals and had to go see my doctor for treatment. I had only taken it once a day for three months. The most recent studies quoted to me at a class for health care providers said that opiates and benzos should not be prescribed to the same patient. They just don<APO>t mix well. I have been a nurse for 40 years, and I learned that at my first job, lol. The instructor of the class said that within a few years, she didn<APO>t think any doctors would be using those two families of meds together. I think that many doctors will blame the DEA for their practice rules rather than just tell a patient that they won<APO>t increase their meds. Either out of ignorance or just because they don<APO>t want to take responsibility for their decision. I don<APO>t think the DEA has specific rules on dosages but many doctors<APO> practice groups have rules either spoken or unspoken that they will not go above a certain dose when using opiates for chronic pain. I would question whether or not opiates were the right medicine if someone ""needed"" a really high dose and still didn<APO>t get moderate relief from their pain. I am not specifically talking about you, I don<APO>t know you well enough for that. Just in general. The DEA has a website, have you gone there to check out what he told you? If you don<APO>t like what he is doing, try ask him for a referral to another doctor that is more comfortable with high doses. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I forgot one thing, ""high"" doses of methadone can cause cardiac problems. A pain management doctor I saw a couple of times for consults said that a baseline EKG would be wise and then a followup one each year for all methadone patients, though he did say at the small dose I was on it probably would not happen. This problem is electrical and is dose related. The heart is like a pump that runs on electricity, you have a lapse in the electrical current and the pump can stop. Take care, Annette""You need to see a doctor to get a diagnosis. Your family doctor would be the first place to go, if you need an orthopedic doctor to see you, your family doctor will let you know how to arrange that. He will help you decide what kind of diagnostic tests you need, as far as xrays, scans, etc. You will need to tell him just how the injury happened as accurately as you can. This helps him figure out what kind of injury might have happened. Write down or print out what you wrote here as a reminder so you don<APO>t forget anything. Take care, Annette""You need to see your doctor for any new or different for you kind of head pain. If your PCP can<APO>t manage this, he will refer you to a specialist. I have had migraines for many years, all of the doctors I have ever seen warned me not to use even over the counter pain meds (like Aleve) more than three days in any one week. They can cause rebound headaches whether they are migraines or from some other source. It is just a side effect of the medicine. While you are waiting to get in to see your doctor, I would keep a headache journal. Write down everything you eat or drink (including times), the times you sleep each day/night, the time of the beginning and end of every headache, what time and how much medicine you take for anything, how severe the headache is, etc. Be as specific as possible. This will help you and the doctor figure out the correct diagnosis and any triggers. Writing things down is far better than depending on your memory. Men get breast cancer too, something to be concerned about, not worried about. Talk to your doctor about any precautions you need to take. Take care, Annette""There really is no cure for migraines. You just start out trying different kinds of preventative meds, first alone then in pairs. You may also need rescue meds to take when a headache starts. Since your pcp is not satisfying you, I agree that getting a consult with a specialist is a good idea. Before you make an appt. with a neurologist, ask him if he has a special interest/training in managing headaches. Not all neurologists do. Going to a headache clinic is also an idea. Most major teaching hospitals have one. Take care, Annette""The rules do not say you have to be completely out of work, but I don<APO>t know anyone who got SSDI while they were still working. I don<APO>t know how it works for kids you age, but you can go to ssa.gov and see what the rules are. I don<APO>t know if they consider going to school full time as being able to work... I also think that as a 19 year old you can be added to your parent<APO>s insurance now, at least until you are 26, that might be cheaper than getting your own somewhere else. Perhaps seeing a pain management doctor would also be useful. Surgeons are really not trained to do long term pain management. Take care, Annette""Great attitude!!! As far as the cane goes, my husband used a 5 iron (golf club) upside down as a cane for several years do to hip problems. It was the right length for him, I put a walker tip on the end of it so it would not slip. He got lots of conversation and little pity from other people. It was a great way to get conversation started. Take care, Annette""Hi, Dave I have really mixed feelings about chiropractors. On one hand, my husband saw one for quite awhile for aches and pains, and he felt he got relief of some kind, although not complete. I liked the older DC he was seeing and discussed my neck issues with him. I would have done anything to avoid neuro-surgery at that point. He told me frankly not to ever let a chiropractor near my neck, ever. I later called several and 3 out of 4 of them said they could ""cure"" my herniated disc, without even seeing me or my films. Even I know better than to make promises like that. Years before that, I had seen one for low back pain from a work injury that the MDs did not fix fast enough to suit me. She left me pain free and also used acupressure to get rid of a migraine for me. However, I did not do that ""Come see me every month for maintenence care."" thing that she suggested. That was over 30 years ago, and I have never had low back pain again. Some doctors I have seen over the years said to go ahead and give chiropractic a try, others said it was nonsense. I have had health insurance that covered it and health insurance that did not. I read one medical study in the last five years that said one should never have chiropractic done on the neck because adjustments there can tear the vertebral artery and cause a stroke. One nurse friend of mine had a stroke on the chiropractor<APO>s table while being adjusted, and lost the use of one side of her body for several years (she did lots of hard work to recover). Chiropractors feel they are able to fully diagnose and treat many kinds of illnesses including ear infections, etc. in children. They have personally told me this. My personal opinion is they may be able to treat some musculoskeletal problems or at least not make them worse. I just don<APO>t buy all the stuff they say they can do, and there don<APO>t seem to be many evidence based studies that prove just what they do works or how much of the time it works. At this point in my life, I am not willing to go to a chiropractor or get experimental or unproven treatments by MDs for that matter. When I was younger, I did both. I think with my low back pain I would have recovered fully with a bit of watchful waiting. The acupressure thing she showed me for my migraines worked a few times in 35 years, but it is not consistently useful. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions. Chiropractors are not MDs, but they are doctors, with a lot of post graduate education, I respect that. I know they cannot prescribe drugs where I live, but they are allowed to order some imaging stuff, not sure what, it might vary from state to state. I don<APO>t think they do themselves any favors by doing off the wall stuff, but neither do MDs and they do their fair share, lol. Rather than say ""I saw my doctor."" perhaps it would be more accurate to say ""I saw my MD."" or ""I saw my chiropractor."" A doctor is any one who has completed a PhD level education technically. Take care, Annette""I have had it too. I had all the symptoms of a stroke, but it resolved over time. Take care, Annette""I would ask a neuro-radiologist to take a look at both CDs and explain them to you. One looked at my husband<APO>s scans and explained them to us, he was very helpful. It is possible, although remotely so, that there was an error of some kind and the films were mixed up. Keep in mind that radiologists are just looking at pictures, they are not reading text, and they do not get to talk to you about your symptoms, etc. Also keep in mind that scans do not necessarily reflect what you are feeling. You can have a normal scan, and horrible symptoms, or a horrible scan and no symptoms at all. I agree that it is odd that yours were radically different in the way you explained them, after just 9 months. Take care, Annette""You need to see your doctor to help you figure out what is causing this. Then come back and share what you find out. There may be folks here who can share what has helped them. Take care, Annette""Most chronic pain is invisible, we just don<APO>t have broken bones to show people that is all. I don<APO>t have what you have, I have my own invisible pain, but I would continue to do your own research and look for new treatments. Do you see a doctor for the vulvadynia pain? If not, I would. Or a pain management specialist who offers oral meds, physical therapy, biofeedback, CBT, etc. in addition to other modalities. I would not see just an interventionalist who just does shots and procedures, but rather a doctor who offers you everything that might help. Be happy for your husband, I am. Spouses can leave, they do not have to accept what we live with. I hope to see you again soon. Take care, Annette""I would just stick with whatever doctor made you feel most comfortable. Toiuch base with him/her periodically to see if they have come across anything new, treatment wise. Every woman has two Bartholin glands, one on either side of the vaginal opening. I don<APO>t know if surgery is the answer for you, I don<APO>t know how removing two healthy glands would help with your problem, but if they have been contributing to your pain that would be something else again. Take care, Annette""An interventionalist is a pain management doctor who uses injections, and/or invasive procedures to manage pain. He generally does not use other treatment modalities like PT, OT, cognitive behavioral therapy, oral meds, heat, massage, etc. I personally feel that any relief that one gets from a variety of treatment modalities is a good thing, and when you add them all together they may provide decent relief. I do not allow my pain to define who I am, or make me ""suffer"", it is just a small part of my life. Thank goodness for my pcp, she works with me to manage my pain. Take care, Annette""I had breast reduction surgery almost six months ago, but did not have implants, just a reconstruction. A different surgery entirely. I still have pains and pulls and all kinds of weirdness going on. However, I would always give it a good solid year after any surgery to give my body time to heal, and completely recover. I have had other surgeries in the past and know what scars feel like as they progress in age. I would go to the original surgeon that did your implants next month, and discuss it with him. Most surgeons follow their patients for at least one year after surgery, he/she has seen the inside of you and is in the best place to advise you now. You had a double mastectomy in 2009, and implants in 2010, your body should be quite exhausted by now. If you had cancer and also went through other treatments like chemo and radiation, I can<APO>t even imagine how you have survived. Those thing affect recovery and healing, etc. All my best to you, and your loved ones. Take care, Annette""Don<APO>t worry about me, I am fine. We have had quite enough cancer in my family, as long as we don<APO>t get anymore of it, I am a happy camper. You take care of yourself, and let me know how you do when you see the surgeon again. Or just want to say hello. Take care, Annette""An operative procedure is for after you have tried all the non-operative options. What else have you tried and why didn<APO>t they work out for you? Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know what state you are in, but when my son was assaulted many years ago, the state we lived in had a victim assistance fund. I had to turn in all the paperwork, but they paid for his medical and emotional therapy for several years after wards. No one tells you about this fund being available, you pretty much have to know about it and ask for it. If you filled out a police report when your husband beat you up and your doctor says your disc problems are related to that, they may help you out. In my son<APO>s case the perpetrator was not caught and convicted, but they still paid his bills. Take care, Annette""Not having a pulse in your leg may be very serious, it means that the doctor cannot feel the artery throbbing in response to your heart beating. I don<APO>t know why, that is why he ordered the test. I would call the office back and ask for more clarification from a nurse or from the doctor. Since he did not send you to the hospital outright, the rest of the exam must have been reasonably okay. He feels comfortable waiting a month for the test. I am fat, always have been, but I don<APO>t worry about other people<APO>s opinions about it. Lots of doctors have told me to lose weight, and they are right, I should. Even when they came out and said that, I didn<APO>t feel they shirked their medical duty to me, if anything they stepped up to the plate and told me what I should be told. They say in medical studies that the more often the doctors tell folks to quit smoking , the more often they actually quit. Being fat is BAD for us, it causes all kinds of medical problems. Most of us know that, I hope you do already. My best friends are sisters and two out of three of them are fat, and have medical consequences, including diabetes most recently. That scared me. Sorry, but you probably got the same kind of treatment from this doctor as anyone else does that sees him. Poor care, and rushed. Of course, he should spend more time with you, and explain what the tests are, why he is doing them, and what the results of those tests might mean to you. I would choose another vascular doctor, and tell your pcp or who ever referred you that this doctor<APO>s bedside manner stinks, but in your (nicer) words. But that is just me. If he is the best vascular surgeon around, I might put up with his bedside manner in case I needed his help in the OR. But, after the surgery I would tell him in my best, old lady way that he needs to be nicer to his patients. Take care, Annette""Thank you so much for writing back to me. It means a lot to me when someone says they were helped by a post of mine. I totally understand about your weight gain & meds. My best friend was the only one in our group when we were young that never had a weight problem. She was put on antidepressants and it changed her whole eating patterns. She would eat candy bars at all hours, and several portions (meals) at each sitting, then offer to clean up so she could eat more in the kitchen. It was totally unlike her normal self. She changed meds but never lost the extra weight she had already gained. I have lost about 50 pounds over the last couple of years, but very slowly and without really trying. My exercise levels are much higher, but I make myself get started each day. I do at least an hour a day, plus some weights for my bat wings, lol. I also have FMS, also DDD and migraines. I used cognitive behavioral therapy and it cured my depression and helped in many other areas of my life. I continue to use that. Take care, Annette""At least you got a trip to Scotland out of it, lol. How long ago was that? As I understand it, when you touch your shins or the tops of your feet with your fingers, they feel hot, do other people feel the heat also if they touch your skin? If that is all that you feel, no pain, no numbness, no tingling, no swelling, no redness, etc. I would try some watchful waiting, and see what happens next. Take care, Annette""Do not use energy drinks or ""legal speed""/bath salts. Testicular torsion is the most serious of things that causes testicular pain. Go see your doctor, be honest with him about whatever legal or illegal drugs you have used. Let him examine you and order any necessary imaging. Take care, Annette""I wasn<APO>t specific about the legal bath salts you are snorting. They are not meant to be used as drugs, they have not been tested for safety or efficacy, they are made to get around the legal requirements of medications. The energy drinks you were using before may contain a lot of caffeine or other substances, who knows. Proper hydration while doing physical work in the summer time heat is very important and dehydration may have contributed to your kidney stones, I don<APO>t know for sure. My son served in the desert and did drink gallons of water and proper hydration replacement drinks. The military made him, they do not want guys dropping like flies for a preventable reason. By the time you feel thirst, you are already dehydrated, so you have to keep up on your fluids from the time you wake up till the time you go to sleep if you are in hot weather. Caffeine and alcohol both can be part of dehydration, they suck the fluids out of your tissues, and make you urinate more, thus losing precious fluid. They should not be a part of hydration at all. I know you already know better than to use the bath salts, but there is my nickels worth of hydration education. Take care, Annette""I have also lived in more than one state, and several metro areas, and have had no trouble finding pcps willing to manage my chronic pain with opioids. It has been the first doctor I saw in person each time. I would not jump into having spinal surgery to fix pain, it generally does not work for pain. Take care, Annette""Hi, Kelly I just dropped in for a minute and saw your post. I have been on daily opioid therapy for over 15 years now, if that isn<APO>t long term I don<APO>t know what is. I have lived in a couple of states and three different cities and had no trouble finding doctors willing to prescribe opioids for me. My pain is mainly from my FMS not the DDD of my cervical spine. I assume I will be on this the rest of my life, but would be thrilled if they found some other therapy that worked. I have never had steroid injections into my spine, although I did have a neurosurgeon do disc surgery on my neck years ago when I developed functional difficulties. He declined to d a second disc later, as I did not have functional changes. I have not had difficulties with my lower back so I don<APO>t have experience with what you describe. I personally do not know the long term consequences of epidurals and such. He is apparently still willing to do them on you. Remind me and I will do a bit of research on them later, I have got to get some sleep. Take care, Annette""I agree about telling the doctor that you are happy with her procedure. You are right, we all like to hear positive things. She is invested in ""her"" treatment working, and all you can do is slowly educate her about your use of narcotics in your life and how they work for you. I really believe that pain management is all about using each of the various modalities that work for you, the sum total of the relief you feel may show her that her treatment is a good part of that for you, but that ""narcotics"" are also a part of your life. Take care, Annette""I replied to this post when I first saw it a couple of days ago. You mentioned more than you did this time. Maybe it was a different poster and not you, read down the threads and you should find my reply. Take care, Annette""it really depends on what kind of problem you have and what kind of surgery you have. Personally, I have not had much relief from a spinal discectomy as far as pain goes, although it relieved other symptoms, and my motor function is restored. My hubby had a hip replacement for AVN, and his pain went to almost nothing except when he overdoes at work. I have not had any spinal injections for my pain. I did have one trigger point injection in my shoulder, and it relieved the pain for about eight months. Take care, Annette""Go back to the doctor who suggested knee replacement and ask him what to do while you put that off. Or go see a pain management doctor meanwhile. You are only on the beginning stage of meds from what you describe in your post. Take care, Annette""Everyone starts with the lowest dose of what works, and then works their way up as needed. It isn<APO>t a matter of ""better"" but different doses and meds that one tries. My primary care doctor manages my meds, but some people add a pain management specialist like they would any other kind of specialist. You don<APO>t give up your primary care doctor, but only one doctor treats your pain. Take care, Annette""You are doing exactly what you are supposed to do. The only suggestion I have is to ask him whether you should deal with this with him by phone or by appt. in person. Every doctor has their own preference. I prefer to deal with all things in person at an appt. I feel I get more focused and better care this way. I know what kind of multitasking goes on while the doctor is on the phone!!! My doctor keeps several appts open for emergencies or urgent propblems for just this reason, I can always get in to see her within a day or so, usually the same day I call in. Take care, Annette""One suggestion I have is to be a broken record, just keep repeating yourself over and over, as long as he doesn<APO>t respond with something that you are willing to try. Don<APO>t get up to leave, sit there and repeat yourself again as he reaches for the doorknob. Many doctors do not ever sit down, that is a bad habit. Ask him to sit, as looming over you makes you uncomfortable. An ER doctor I worked with years ago, always sat down. He had been taught somewhere along the line that patients will think you spend more time with them if you sit, even if you don<APO>t. Then they don<APO>t sue you later on, lol. He had never been sued, so I guess it worked. He was also a great doctor. Was the sample pack some thing that helped? Tell him exactly what you want to physically do that you are currently unable to do because of your pain. Try being goal oriented. You do have a right to decent care, he may not be able to eliminate your pain, but he should be able to make it managable for you. Take care, Annette""ANY time your doctor tells you there is nothing more to be done and you are still in pain, ask for a referral (if you need one) to a different doctor who might be able to help you. I have had FMS for over 15 years, there are natural ups and downs with this disorder, but between exercise, meds, and other do it myself stuff, it comes out okay. I can<APO>t work anymore, but I do some volunteer work and life goes on. I am happy and get along in life just fine. Take care, Annette""See the post on this thread that I posted earlier to day, I few minutes before this one. Get a referral to another doctor, or just go find one on your own. Take care, Annette""I do not call and speak to my doctor on the phone, I call and make an appt. and go see her in person. That way she gets paid for her visit, as she should, so why should I feel guilty? That<APO>s her job. I also feel I get much better medical care than I would over the phone. It is a reasonable medical problem, it takes time and adjustments to manage chronic pain. I used to see my doctor much more often than I do now, I will again when my meds need changing. Aside from feeling like a bother, it might be time for you to go on a long acting opiate on a set schedule, with Norco or oxycodone IR as a break through med. Long acting meds often work better as you keep pain at bay for most of the day. You don<APO>t get the relief ups and downs that you get with short acting meds. Take care, Annette""Hydrocodone comes with tylenol. As far as I know it is the only short acting opiate left in common usage that is not available without tylenol. Some short acting opiates that spring immediately to mind and are available without tylenol are codeine, oxycodone IR, morphine IR, and Dilaudid. Talk to your doctor about this. Take care, Annette""I posted this the other night, but I guess it just disappeared, along with other posts. I never know what will stick and what won<APO>t. In addition to what you are talking about, I have gotten an ""Error"" message when I click on the ""Watch this discussion"" statement at the bottom of the post along with ""Reply"". In fact, I have not received a watch list for ages, even before the Error statement started popping up. I use Firefox, but other sites work just fine. I don<APO>t think what I say is important enough to copy and repost. If you lose it, oh well....your loss, not mine. Take care, Annette""Yes, but since they don<APO>t work in the same way they used to, I don<APO>t use them much. Hugs, Annette""The Error message when I click on ""Watch this discussion"" is not inconsistent, it is ALWAYS there now. I have gone from posting every day on four different WebMD boards to posting on this one consistently, and one other rarely. Sad.... Hugs, Annette""Sorry, but after waiting for a couple of years for the email digests to come back, only to have them return in a different and useless way, it doesn<APO>t matter to me enough to make links to discussions and snap screen shots to complain about how something doesn<APO>t work here. No one cares enough to fix it anyway. Sorry you are caught in the middle, I shouldn<APO>t have even posted that I was having a problem. That is about as much trouble as I am willing to take. If I didn<APO>t have friends here, I wouldn<APO>t bother to come here at all. Hugs, Annette""I read a similar study where they used a mirror down the midline of the body. By looking at your good leg in the mirror where your bad leg usually was, it apparently confused the brain into thinking you had two good legs. They said it worked well for some patients with RSD a very difficult disorder to treat successfully. Interesting.... Take care, Annette""I have a couple of chronic pain conditions, my doctor has always told me to come see her for any new, or different, pain. I know it is often related to the old condition, but sometimes it is not and it is treatable. Take care, Annette""Many people have found that taking a long acting opiate is better than taking a short acting opiates 5x a day. You get a steadier level of pain meds in your blood stream which often leads to better pain control and fewer side effects. You won<APO>t know until you try. I found it better to start new meds when I have nothing much to do for a few days, I let my husband know I am taking something new, so he can let me know if he sees any odd behaviour that I might miss. When I started on long acting meds, I went with what was available in generic form, cheaper for my insurance company and for me. I used generic long acting morphine (like MS Contin). I am an old retired nurse and I prefer generic meds when possible. I stayed on that for about 13-14 years, now I am on methadone, way cheap. I only changed due to cost. It works fine for me, but remember we are all different, and as many people will knock any drug as those that will say it is great. It all depends on your personal experiences and expectations. Take care, Annette""If you are under 26, you should be able to get insurance on your parents<APO> policies???? Take care, Annette""Even though you are 19 and live away from your parents, you may still be able to get on their insurance if they have it. Maybe you could ask them, if they are alive. I don<APO>t think pre-existing conditions apply in this case. Medicare through your grandma is not an option, as you have already found out. Take care, Annette""If you had the stones analyzed when you passed them the doctor could tell you if there were any way to prevent them from forming. The chemical makeup of the stones would tell you what yo try. Meanwhile, stay well hydrated so any ""small"" stones will pass without causing so much pain. Take care, Annette""I believe we all must take hold of our medical care. Why on earth did you keep allowing him to stick you with needles every month for two years if you had NO improvement at all? The only long term side effect I have found on reading about steroid injections with long acting anesthetic is that you can develop thinning of the bones of the spine adjacent to the injections. What does your rheumatologist say when you ask him this question? Take care, Annette""Thank you, Dr. Maine. Take care, Annette""Could we have a professional reply here, please? I am not sure we are all talking about the same thing. I understand epidural injections to be injections into the epidural space of the spinal column for pain control and/or anesthesia. Injecting the nerves outside the epidural space would be a different procedure, I think? Dr. Abaci or Dr. Maine, could you chime in on this with proper definitions please? Take care, Annette""Hi, Charles I thought the same as you wrote about the various injections, however, I have seen people post before and they seem to lump all pain management injections into the same barrel. I think an explanation by the doctor of each type would be useful just as a learning tool for all of us. Always good to read your posts. Take care, Annette""I hope you are seeing a different doctor now, particularly perhaps a neurologist to figure out why you are having myelin degeneration at your age. I don<APO>t know how much of your current difficulties are due to the injections and how much you may have had anyway. Take care, Annette""Take her to her doctor. Take care, Annette""Keep in mind when you are closer to coming home from Europe that the US does not treat supplements the same as drugs, like they do in many places in Europe. There is little to no quality control checking here.You have to be willing to trust the companies that are making money by selling you supplements to begin with. Lyrica is not addictive as far as I know. I take gabapentin, an older, but closely related, drug. I can take it or not, all I have is more pain and increased symptoms, but no withdrawal problems or urge to take it. It sounds like your husband is doing the right things for most cases of sciatica by losing weight and swimming. I have had it twice, and it can be self limiting. You don<APO>t say how long he has had it? Or why he has it? My cases were probably from poor injection site choice by a nurse giving me a shot for something unrelated. Take care, Annette""If you are still in ""allot of pain, even when I take the medication"", there may be a reason why they don<APO>t use it, it may not work for your kind of pain. Unfortunately, opiates do not work well for everyone for every kind of pain. I do have FMS, and it is often triggered by some other chronic pain disorder, like the back problems you described. The doctors are correct in figuring out if you have that before jumping into any kind of surgery. That could just make things worse. Maybe your psychiatrist could suggest a pain management doctor for you? They often work together. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t think it is all about being sued.I worked in the ER with an ER doc who prescribed a patient some antidepressant meds for the patient while he was in town for a family emergency, the patient went back to his motel room and OD<APO>d, he died. The doctor was truly devastated. It was not about $$ or legal stuff, it was about a patient dying. No one wants to be responsible for that...""The post I put up regarding the ED patient was in response to another person, not you. It did not even refer to you in particular, just my personal experience with a doctor who had a patient intentionally kill himself using the RX that this doctor gave him, and how it affected the doctor involved. Your comments about liking being manic worry me though. I have cared for folks while they were manic, they are just as sick as when they are depressed. It is difficult to find that balance for bipolar folk. I do understand that you are put in a bad position, you have multiple disorders and the treatment for your pain, may set off your bipolar disorder. I still say talk to your psychiatrist about all of this, and ask him for a referral to a pain management doctor, or maybe he could write your RX for pain meds himself?? It isn<APO>t like you are taking much anyway. You do not have to be a pain management doctor to write pain med RXs. Take care, Annette""Considering that you are buying drugs on the street, and taking them, and have a history of bipolar and suicide attempts, I am not surprised that your doctor is less than willing to write prescriptions for you for opiates. Cutting up an extended release pill and taking such a large dose would show me that you are not reliable and I would not want to risk my medical license on trusting you. The reason you bought drugs from a ""friend of a friend"" really doesn<APO>t matter to most doctors. You are lucky she is giving you the three vicodin a day, many doctors would simply discharge you from their practice and move on. Take care, Annette""Hi, Peskypain I just wanted to say that I totally agree with your 5th paragraph from the top and the 4th from the bottom. (Not counting ""Still sending hugs"" There is no magic medicine that will work for everyone. I totally believe that anyone who posts here who has a doctor, should talk to their doctor. Your doctor knows far more than we do about your medical problems. He/She is the one to talk to. It is fine to get general information here, but let the patient and doctor decide what RXs and dose to write for. For many people who post here, there are reasons (that often do not come out until later) that their doctors do not wish to write for what the patient thinks they should have. Take care, Annette""Hi, Kelly I can only reply to you that I was not thinking of you or anything you wrote when I posted to Peskypain. I apologize that you got that impression. Take care, Annette""I tried MMJ and it did not help my pain at all. All my doctors at the time told me to use whatever I wanted in moderation. I was not taking daily opiates at that time. Have you asked the doctors why they don<APO>t want you to use opiates and MMJ together? Do they have any medical reasons? In my experience, there has not been a lot of medical research regarding the interactions between MMJ and other drugs, or even just using MMJ for various kinds of chronic pain. I spoke to a doctor up in Idaho about 12 years ago who was a neurologist who thought MMJ might be useful in treating migraines, his main complaint was also a lack of quality medical research due to government restrictions on using MMJ for any studies at all. Are you in a state where your MMJ is prescribed by a doctor or one where you self medicate? How do you get your MMJ? In my state you pretty much have to grow your own or have a designated caregiver grow it for you. Where my brother lived, you could buy it in dispensaries. I am really sorry you have come up against so many difficulties in finding treatment. I haven<APO>t, all my doctors have been very helpful in managing my chronic pain with me. Take care, Annette""I am for decriminalizing marijuana altogether. That said, since my current state passed its own version of MMJ law, I believe it is vastly over-prescribed and under researched. Anyone can get a form signed by a doctor. I have read that a few doctors actually are retired except for this service, so they don<APO>t really care about their DEA numbers. It is even more scary than what you describe in your Pain Management clinics as far as little examination, and lots of signatures for $$. We both have different views on why pain management doctors don<APO>t want to prescribe opiates to patients on MMJ. I still think there is a lack of decent research on drug interactions with marijuana. I believe that first we should do the research. We also should keep in mind that marijuana remains illegal at the federal level. It is fine for us to be willing to risk that for ourselves, but I would not ask my doctor to risk her DEA number. The Drug Enforcement Agency is a federal agency. Without it she could not really practice medicine any longer in her current practice. I would not ask any doctor to risk their livelihood for my comfort. There are enough drugs available for chronic pain for me. The dispensaries in Calif. are just drug dealers. I feel pretty much the same way about drug companies, lol. Whatever discount you get, don<APO>t kid yourself, they are making money of of you just like drug companies do off of all of us. Since your own doctor is brave enough to sign the MMJ papers, perhaps he could prescribe your other meds? My pcp writes my RX for the opiates I use, I don<APO>t go to a pain management clinic. Take care, Annette""It is not an appropriate request for your first visit with a new doctor. He needs to form a trusting relationship with you to prescribe opiates at all, even the ones you are already on. It is best to have enough opiates from your old doctor for 2-3 months, so you can get to know the new doctor before you ask for opiates. I know that is not always possible, but in my experience it is the best way to start out with a new doctor. Dilaudid is best given for acute pain, not chronic pain. It is very short acting. In the ER it is usually given IV, which does work very quickly and gives very good relief. The oral pills that you would take at home do not work as quickly or as well. They often only last 2-3 hours. It is rarely used for chronic pain, and I have never heard of it being used as the primary pain med. It is sometimes used as the breakthrough med while someone is on a long acting opiate, but even that happens rarely. Esophagitis, esophageal spasms and GI problems are not usually treated with Percocet on a long term basis. I assume the Percocet is for something else, perhaps the car accident. What doctor did you see for the severe accident you were in? Is he the one prescribing the percocet for you? Will you no longer be seeing him either? I would suggest you find a pain management doctor in addition to the new PCP, perhaps you could ask him for a referral. That way he would not assume you were seeking drugs from him. Take care, Annette""I agree, I was approved for SSDI when I went before the judge and explained what was going on with me. I had good documentation of just what I could and could not do and why. I had documentation from multiple doctors and voc rehab counselors (other than SSA<APO>s). The problem with SSDI is that you have to be unable to work at ANY job in the national economy, even if it does not exist where you live. They have a minimum amount of money that you could make, that changes with the current date, when I applied it was $850 per month. As an RN I would have to work only a few hours a week to make that much money. I had already been to voc rehab and tried a more sedentary part-time nursing job, and then I was turned down twice before seeing the judge. My lawyer told me that a ""potato chip checker"" was the famous job that SS said anyone could do, sitting or standing, with no education or heavy lifting required, lol, just watch the conveyor belt for discolored chips and remove them. My lawyer and others have told me that it is not the diagnosis that matters, but what a specific person is able to do or not do, and for how long. That stuff is not usually documented in a medical record by most MDs. Keep trying. Take care, Annette""I am so glad to give everyone a giggle. However, that was a job that SS told my lawyer that one of her clients could do. Do you not know anything about buffing metal? The buffer is a wheel attached to your work bench, all you have to hold is the silverware. You can sit/stand or any combination of the two, lol. W/C will find a way to get you off of their books, and SS will do anything to keep you from getting on theirs. SSDI actually told me on one of the refusals of my SSDI claim that even if I could not work as an RN I could work in a podiatrist<APO>s office as his nurse/asst. What is the difference? Take care, Annette""Glad to make anyone giggle. My lawyer told SSDI actually suggested that job to one of her clients. So the potato chip checkers and the SSA both know about that job, lol. Take care, Annette""If he is 48 years old and of sound mind, this is a decision he must make for himself. I agree with you that just talking to a good knee surgeon is a logical thing to do at this point. I have a husband also though, and I know that what he thinks may not always sound logical to me. When it hurts enough, he may do what you feel is right. Take care, Annette""Arthritis and DDD and multiple herniated discs all describe the same thing, just different words. The arthritis can occur all over the body, but arthritis of the spine is also referred to as DDD. Herniated discs are part of degenerative disc disease. I went through a similar problem from a motor vehicle that rear-ended me at a stop sign. My neurosurgeon diagnosed me some time later (a few months) with another herniated cervical disc, but he told me that unless I had had an MRI just before the accident, and one immediately afterward, there was no way to say whether or not it was caused by the accident. He had repaired an adjacent one six months prior to the accident. I know nothing about the legal system in NY, we are all dealing with chronic pain of varying kinds here. Would getting another opinion from a different doctor help you? Take care, Annette""How many substances cause this reaction so far? The easiest thing is for her to just stay away from anything that bothers her, since she can see this happening and it goes away immediately upon removing her hand from the substance. It does not seem like a life threatening thing if it is so easily controlled and reversed. I would wonder why she does not continue to have this reaction until she washes her hands to remove all traces of the offending substance. And why she reacted to antibiotics sealed in an IV bag, but seemingly not to a plain IV bag of fluids, since they must piggyback the antibiotics onto a regular IV bag? Odd. By the way, I would not call muscle tremors or spasms ""seizures"". Seizures are an entirely different phenomenon. A grand mal seizure that causes whole body jerking, also includes a lack of consciousness, the person actually loses consciousness and does not remember the events during the seizure at all. It is great that she has a good NMD (naturopath??), and a good chiropractor, what kind of MD does she have currently? Take care, Annette""I would always get a second opinion from an unrelated surgeon, then decide for yourself, or even get a third opinion. Make sure you let the second (and third)doctors know that they will not be doing surgery on you that you just want their opinion to help you make up your mind. Have you seen a neurologist or a neurosurgeon or both? I have never met one doctor who was both, but they might exist somewhere. A neurologist does not cut, he would check out your CNS and let you know what was going on and what your treatment options would be. A neurosurgeon actually does surgery, and surgeons like to cut to fix things. Having herniated discs does not necessarily mean that surgery would be good for you. What does your MS specialist suggest for you to do? Take care, Annette""Oxycontin and Percocet both contain oxycodone as the basic opiate medicine. So at this point in time he only takes the Percocet and Lyrica? It could be either med or neither med. There is so much you do not say that it would be impossible to guess why he seems confused. His age? When they did the BKA? Peripheral Vascular Disease may also mean that he may have some vascular problems in his brain? Does he smoke? Did he? Even surgery and anesthesia can cause confusion in some folks, let alone someone who has other issues. I would ask for a neurology consult and get a second opinion. Also a pain management consult from a different doctor. If possible you should be present at these consultations. Take care, Annette""It is difficult to know if the discs were herniated from the accident or if they were already beginning to fail since you had already had backaches. I personally don<APO>t think it is really important what came first. The important thing is what to do next. I would research the Spine Med decompression treatment thoroughly. Find real medical studies that use a double blind method to evaluate the effectiveness of this treatment method. Read about how effective it may be given your time frame from when your leg pain began. Your doctor that is recommending it should be able to give you links to research studies that show it to be effective. If he cannot, I would decline myself. Find out what the possible adverse effects are and how often they happen. No one wants to think the adverse effects of any treatment will happen to them, but they do happen to some people and it could be you. Make sure the trade off of benefits vs. risks is right for you with any treatments, the Spine Med, surgery, or even oral meds. I don<APO>t know what your chosen career is or if this issue would make it impossible to pursue it, but you need to find out now, not later after you invest a lot of time and money in this career. You state department of disability and vocational rehabilitation should be able to evaluate you for this career and give you some guidance. You may need a letter from your doctor stating you have had a back injury and need vocational evaluation. I found them very useful. No one knows if you will be in pain the rest of your life, NO ONE can tell you that. No one can give you any guarantees about the outcome of any treatment. We are all different and we all respond differently to various treatments. Take care, Annette""Just so folks know, the bathroom medicine cabinet is about the worst place to keep any kind of medicines at all. It tends to be warm and humid, neither are good conditions for storing drugs. Cool and dry is far better. Keep all drugs under lock and key if there is any chance snoopy neighbors or any children/teens will be around. Keep the locked box in a bedroom closet or stashed away somewhere else cool and dry. I keep a small pill box with one days worth of meds in my purse or nearby while I do household chores. Take care, Annette""If you are only on narcotic pain meds, opioids, then you should not need to be hospitalized to come off of them. Ask your doctor to help you taper off very slowly. I don<APO>t know your dose but it could take weeks to months to do it slow enough so you don<APO>t have serious withdrawal symptoms. The problem is that the pain you had will come back. I have accepted that the opioids I am on were only started when nothing else worked. There is nothing new out there to try that would probably work any better. I only have constipation as a side effect, so I will stick with what I have. The great thing is that if you find it doesn<APO>t work for you and want to go back up on the doses, your doctor can work with you to do that at any time. If you are on multiple types of meds, opioids and benzos for instance, then withdrawing becomes more difficult but still managable as an outpatient. Talk to your doctor!! Do not do this without medical supervision. Take care, Annette""Don<APO>t worry what ""people"" say, just what your doctor says. Mine does liver function tests regularly along with the rest of my blood work. The opioids do not generally cause any organ damage, it is the acetaminophen that often is mixed in with short acting opiates. Talk to your doctor!!! He/she can<APO>t read your mind, as long as you don<APO>t say anything, of course the doctor assumes you are okay. The doctor can lead you through tapering your opiate dose if that is what you want. I have never seen a doctor yet, who complained that his patient didn<APO>t want his narcotics anymore. My husband has tapered off of methadone twice since I have been with him, 20 years, and tapered off of morphine and oxycodone before I met him. He never had ANY withdrawal symptoms. I don<APO>t worry about tapering off of opiates when I no longer need them, if and when that day comes, I will just do it. I had breast reduction surgery last January and I was able to slowly taper my methadone down to half the usual dose within several weeks. Talk to your doctor about all this, tell him just what you wrote here and ask him for guidance and reassurance. There is a real difference between dependence and addiction, it does not sound like you are an addict at all. Take care, Annette""Hi, Dr. Abaci I remember when they used methadone to substitute for opiates, but you were still dependent on a drug that could cause withdrawal symptoms when you decided to go off of it. Does this newer drug that you mentioned, buprenorphine, cause dependence at all? Are any withdrawal symptoms considered the norm when you stop taking it? Do you consider it part of the transition to being drug free, or do you consider using it instead of traditional opiates as the end result? Lastly, is it available in generic from? Take care, Annette""Thank you for your explanation of these different drugs. Take care, Annette""Hi, kswagert I am glad you like your doctors. I see mine once every three months as long as everything is okay. I have seen her for over 15 years, and had one drug test a couple of years ago. But I did sign a contract with her, saying I would have them whenever she asked, among other things. Each practice has their own rules about how often you have to be seen, etc. Take care, Annette""I hope tomorrow is better for you. Take care, Annette""I just want people to appreciate their doctors, and the others to know there are good ones out there. Take care, Annette""Hi, Beth Please think of the people who took opiates or other downers, and then took stimulants, or vice versa, and ended up strung out on both. Maybe I am much older than the rest of the folks here, but I remember the drug addictions of the 1960-70s. Many were from doctor prescribed drugs. Doctors prescribed amphetamines just like they are now prescribing Nuvigil and other meds like it. I see the same kind of thing happening again, as the patients and doctors are now too young to remember. Drug companies now and then just want to make money, you can<APO>t trust them to tell you the truth. I could just be very paranoid, but I really don<APO>t think it is a good idea to take a stimulant to counter the side effects of pain meds. Just my opinion. Feel free to ignore it, lol. Hugs, Annette""I<APO>ve missed you too. Glad to see you back again. I am with you, it is far better to be in pain and enjoying life than to just lay around and suffer. Hugs, Annette""First and foremost, I want to thank you for your military service. I am glad you finally found someone that worked out for you. I have also followed my pcp from one group practice, to a solo practice, to another group practice. At first she was about eight blocks from my home, now I go about 33 miles each way to see her. She is well worth it to me. She manages my chronic pain with an occasional consult from a PM specialist. I truly believe there is someone out there for each of us, we just have to keep looking. Take care, Annette""Hi, Caprice It IS great reading the positive experiences. I have had the pleasure of working with a number of Canadian nurses down here in the US. They have been wonderful, I think it is something about the person who chooses to be a health care professional rather than geographically where they are. By the way, they all spoke highly of the Canadian system and went home when they developed health issues. They liked the extra $$ they could make out in California, lol. That was then, it may be different now, who knows. Hugs, Annette""How about everyone post their positive interactions with medical people just this once. It just happened that I had my six month post op visit with my surgeon and my usual every three month visit with my internist today. Both visits went great, they are both wonderful, caring human beings. When I had my surgery in January, I got great nursing care for the short time I was at the hospital. It is nice when even an old nurse cannot fault the nursing staff for anything at all. My internist is with a new practice now, and getting used to the computer system. They do all their charting by computer, she didn<APO>t have that option in her old office. I have been seeing her for about 15 years now, and I took her a small gift today as a thank you. The more I read here, the more appreciative I am to have her. She is easy to talk to and responsive to all my medical needs, including the chronic pain I have had all along. She adjusts my meds as needed, up or down. She has been there with me through all three of my son<APO>s deployments to combat zones when my insomnia was worse than usual and my pain got out of control for awhile. Please post you positive experiences, we all need to know there are good doctors out there if you look for them. I know there are, because I have had several of them over the years. Take care, Annette""Many doctors feel that tolerance develops more slowly with long acting opiates than with the same amount of short acting opiates. Have you discussed this with them? When they hand you the RX, read it and double check to make sure it is correct before you leave. The only difference is acetaminophen (Tylenol) like Peskypain said, and you can still take that separately if you feel it helps. Take care, Annette""I would also ask the doctor how he defines ""success"", it may only be a 50% reduction in pain, you may expect 100% relief. If you are talking apples and oranges, you may be very disappointed and he won<APO>t understand why. Take care, Annette""Best of luck to you. Let me know how you do. Take care, Annette""I strongly recommend www.myalgia.com for good medical advice about the diagnosis and treatment of FMS. They are not selling anything, so they don<APO>t have a financial interest in what you decide to do. I tried all the different types of antidepressants except MAO inhibitors for FMS. Frankly, none of them worked for me, and most made my symptoms worse. I stopped using them altogether. I now use opiates for pain, ambien for sleep, and I started using neurontin 5-6 years ago and I do find it very useful both for pain management and for reducing my migraines and helping me to sleep. I occasionally add baclofen when I have a flare. I have found this useful and it helps me avoid increasing the opiate dose. The thing is we are all very different, and different things will work for different people. You have to just try the different treatments and see what works for you. Do not rely entirely on medications, you have to use all the treatments methods out there to reduce your pain levels and help you sleep. You will probably have to live with this for the rest of your life, so it is worth it to work on finding the best things for you. I have had it for about 12 years now, and I have to say it is much easier to deal with it now than it was at the beginning. Take care, Annette""Charles has used biofeedback and he says it relieves part of his pain. From what he said it sounded worthwhile. I have never tried it, but it is non-invasive and non-drug, two positive things in my mind. You cannot get bad side effects, and once you learn how to do it, you don<APO>t even need their monitors and machines. I use cognitive behavioural therapy techniques, along with other things, and have found them very useful. Whatever works for you. I feel that by using several different things that all give you partial relief, you will end up ahead of the game. Let us know how it works for you. Take care, Annette""Go see your doctor for a check up to make sure that is all it is. Take care, Annette""Did you find and see a psychiatrist to treat your depression? Often people in chronic pain are also depressed or have anxiety issues, they need to be treated by the professional best trained to treat them, a psychiatrist. Many people balk at seeing a psychiatrist, even though it is just another specialist who treats specific illnesses. It is nearly impossible to treat pain adequately while a person is severely depressed. You have to treat both. Take care, Annette""I would speak to the doctor who prescribed it for you and ask him what he wants you to do for break through pain and if you can use the Norco along with the Butrans patch. Your pharmacist might also be helpful for information about drug interactions. Take care, Annette""Today is Thursday and you have probably completed your procedures, I hope all went well for you. Be sure to mention the depression to your medical doctor if you have not already. The interaction between chronic pain and depression may be complicated, get it looked after. Take care, Annette""Best of luck to you with your surgery. I hope all goes well for you. Take care, Annette""Lyrica is also an anticonvulsant as well as an anlagesic. Many anticonvulsants are used for pain management, as are antidepressants. Gabapentin was shown in medical studies to help with neuropathic pain related to Shingles and diabetic neuropathy (before Lyrica was fully developed and approved for use by the FDA shortly before gabapentin went generic). They are very closely related. I have used both, and gabapentin worked better for me, and is available in generic form, much cheaper. That really has no bearing on anyone else choosing to use this drug, as we all respond differently to meds. I also had spinal surgery on my neck though, not on my lower back. It worked for functionality, which is what I was looking for, not pain management, not an issue at that time. I agree with you that surgery should always be the last choice for treatment after less invasive methods are tried. Take care, Annette""How long was your pain seriously relieved after the surgery? I would really hesitate to consent to yet another surgery. But, I don<APO>t have your pain, or your back. Take care, Annette""Hi, Beth I had a totally different surgery from what you are describing. I had no fusion of my neck so I did not have to wear a collar at all, and was back to work in six weeks as an RN in ER with the only restriction being to not lift things above my shoulders, not that difficult to avoid doing as a nurse. The neurosurgeon removed the disc and some spurs, and let the two vertebrae fuse together on their own. I took him almost eight hours to do the surgery, longer than expected, due to the spurs. He did an xray after 4-5 months to make sure they had fused, and they had. The incision was about 2-2 1/2 inches long on the front of my neck. He did it in a crease so it really doesn<APO>t show. I was rapidly losing the small motor function in my hands, and was dropping things, that was why he agreed to do the surgery. He would not do it for pain alone. I would go to Shand<APO>s again since they have seen you once before. Then, before agreeing to any surgery, I would get a second opinion from a neuro-surgeon, and also ask a neurologist (not a surgeon) what he suggests you do. Then weigh all your options. The rheumatologist is doing his job, but listen to the surgeons who do this sort of thing all the time. I am personally against any Laser Surgery Center that advertises in any way. If they don<APO>t, I think it would be fine to see them as a second opinion and see what they have to offer you. I have to tell you that a Doctor with a laser rushed a friend of mine into having laser surgery on her spine in 4-5 days, after her own doctor told her it was not a good idea, then refused to see her afterwards for a new and different kind of pain she was having, sciatica. She threatened to call a lawyer, and the doctor saw her once, gave her an injection and told her he ""couldn<APO>t do anything more"" and not to call him about anything. Anyone with FMS takes longer to deal with any kind of pain, so I have let things go for months on end, and usually they go away. That is just me though. I have Irritable Bladder Syndrome as a co-morbidity of the FMS, so I can relate to you feeling like you have a bladder infection all the time, that is how I felt too. The gabapentin helped that also. I hope it does for you too. I was able to stop taking the medicine I took for this problem completely, it didn<APO>t work that well anyway. I took up belly dancing a few years ago, I think it was the year I turned 60. I use DVDs and the TV set to dance with. I have no dance back ground at all. It is nice because it is all about isolations, and I have been known to simply omit any areas that I need to until they heal. I had breast reduction surgery a couple of years ago, and the doctor said not until I was healed was I to do any chest isolations. But I could still do everything else. I have done an hour every day, except for a week when I go to my sons house for each Xmas. I also lift weights for about 10 minutes a day. Please don<APO>t ever stop dancing. I should have started years ago. Be careful with the heating pads, do not lay on top of them, and always keep a towel between your skin and the pad. All to avoid burns. Take care, Annette""I had stiff hands in the AMs when I was in nursing school 40 years ago. I would work them under hot running water until they worked better. A doctor back then xrayed them and told me I had arthritis. It went away on its own after six months or so. They were not numb though. I would see a neurologist or a rheumatologist about it. Take care, Annette""Me, too. Life goes on, it is generally good. I have pain every day, not like before I was diagnosed with FMS, but I have found with some adjustments to my life, I can deal with it. Take care, Annette""I agree with Swank. I also do not discuss it in general conversation, only with very close friends/family, and then rarely. Best not to dwell on pain. Take care, Annette""Has she been worked up for cancer or other possibilities? UTIs and their treatment do not cause compression fractures. It sounds very complicated, I would suggest you make her an appt., with her permission of course, to see someone at a university medical center with a medical school. They often handle more difficult cases and look for complicated diagnoses. If you feel the least bit uncomfortable with her care so far, go elsewhere. Take care, Annette""Ask him to please refer you to a pain management specialist that manages medications or to a different pcp who is more willing or knows more that he does. It is normal to go from a short acting opiate and the other meds you are on, to a long acting opiate for better pain control, before considering a surgical or invasive procedure like an SCS. An SCS may work fine, it may not, I just don<APO>t think you are at that point yet. Do some reading of your own to find out more about all your options. Take care, Annette""Then ask him to send you to a different PM doctor who is willing to write RXs for long acting opiates, in addition to short acting ones. Or perhaps go see a neurologist??? Tell him you would like a second opinion with a PM doctor who knows all the treatments available to you. The two options he gave you may not be your only options. You should be told ALL your treatment options. Take care, Annette""Talk to your doctor about his preferences, if any, for bowel care. Many people find if all they are taking is a small dose of short acting opiate occasionally, they can manage their bowels with extra fluids, or exercise, after that stool softeners, and perhaps a stimulant type laxative would work best. For folks using opiates daily it often take a stimulant type of laxative to keep things moving, as opiates sometimes stop or slow down the peristalsis that goes on in the bowels. That is how they cause constipation. Other drugs also can cause constipation, so talk to your doctor, this is a common problem, so don<APO>t worry about it, he has heard it all before. Take care, Annette""Of course it is his job to keep all his papers up to date. Not yours. Sure, getting really angry doesn<APO>t help anything, but you did apologize and you had good reason to be upset. I would ask him what his back up plan is for the future, does he have another doctor who is willing to sign RXs for him or see his patients? Is your neuro doctor a neurosurgeon or a neurologist? Cervical dystonia means the muscles in the neck are somewhat lacking in tone. I don<APO>t know if PT would be useful for this or what exactly your PM doctor is suggesting PT for. Tell him to talk to your neuro doctor and hash it out between themselves, then for them to talk to you. Ask for links to studies so you can read about PT for yourself. The medical studies I have read about botox being used for headaches was that only about 50% of the people who got the drug had any improvement at all. That study was done quite awhile ago, but it was enough for me and my doctor to decide they were not for me. Hopefully, now there are larger studies available for you to read and decide if this would be helpful for your particular case. They are very expensive. Make sure they have been tested for the type of headache you have. Take care, Annette""I can<APO>t think of any kind of surgery for cervical dystonia. That is why I asked when you said you had a ""neuro"" if it was a neurologist or a neurosurgeon. Demerol went out of use because it was found that people can easily become toxic to its metabolites, and have seizures, etc. This is an unpredictable side effect that can happen with frequent use, or occasional use. We used to give it all the time, but not anymore. There are other opiates that work just as well for pain. I had cervical disc surgery back in the early 1990s, but the best thing I ever did for my upper back, shoulder and lower neck pain and tightness was have breast reduction surgery. I just did it six months ago, wish I had done it many years ago. I asked my current doctor if she thought it would help, no one ever mentioned it to me first. She referred me to a plastic surgeon and we went from there. Take care, Annette""Look out what you wish for. I worked with a Dr. once in the ER who had back surgery. He was a wonderful doctor, very understanding and kind. He hurt his back and ended up with chronic back pain. He finally had surgery with success as far as pain relief went. After all of this was done and over, he and I were talking one night, he said he had lost all compassion for chronic pain patients as he had been one and if he managed to cover his work shifts, so should they. He felt they were a bunch of whiners. Fortunately, this was not conveyed to patients, he continued to treat them well. It is all in the personal attitude and how you behave and act throughout your life. Take care, Annette""I would go see a second surgeon for another opinion. Make sure he specializes in lap nephrectomies or similar surgeries. Please define ""ipsilateral orchialgia"" and what kind of symptoms you are having currently. Take care, Annette""You can write the hospital and get a copy of the OR report, be sure to include your birth date and full name. I don<APO>t know if a resident did the actual work or not. Whoever signed the OR report is responsible for the surgery. In teaching hospitals residents often do part of the procedure, but the surgeon on record must still be responsible for his resident<APO>s work. That is what I assumed the definition was, but you seem to be having more symptoms than just pain in the testes. Some may be referred pain, but that would mean making assumptions, not a wise thing to do. You are also having pain in the flank and thigh areas, and the left leg is giving out completely. I would get a second surgical consult from as far away as possible from the hospital where you had the surgery. You do not want to see a surgeon who works at the same hospital. Meanwhile, perhaps you could see a pain management doctor for symptoms control??? Take care, Annette""Before you decide to have another surgery, do your homework and study up on this type of surgery in your type of disorder. Only your surgeon can even come close to responding to your questions about work, etc. I would doubt it personally from the small amount of information given. Take care, Annette""All I can suggest is a hot bath just before bedtime, and just after a routine of gentle stretching. My husband eats bananas and drinks tonic water when he gets leg/foot cramps. Take care, Annette""I am an RN who no longer works due to various chronic pain conditions. You may just have to accept that your part of controlling your pain means not being able to do hard physical work anymore. I hated that decision, but eventually made it for myself. Good luck to you. Take care, Annette""Ask the doctor to order whatever imaging he feels is necessary that you have not had done already. That puts the ball back in his court. Take care, Annette""The best way to understand MRIs is to discuss it with the doctor who ordered it, he should know your history as well as any symptoms you are having. They all interconnect. Take care, Annette""I use a sleep aid, zolpidem, every night, and also sit in my hot tub EVERY single night. I used to skip that step occasionally, but found I always woke up in the middle of my sleep and hurt like crazy. Now I make myself do it. Exercise, that dreaded word, also helps. I do that every day, and I sleep better too. A recent study was in the paper recently that said people did not sleep as well with the TV on, they woke up less refreshed, and had multiple wake ups during the night. So, since then I have been sleeping with the TV off completely. I feel like I am sleeping better. I used to fall asleep with the TV going and just left it on a channel that was boring, with a calming voice doing the narration. Take care, Annette""I had read that, but they said the same thing about reading and eating in bed, so of course, I ignored it. It does make sense not to watch the news before going to sleep. It makes me too angry or too sad. So I stopped doing that when my son got home from his last deployment. That helped a little, but my husband watches TV to go to sleep so he would leave it on all night. I am a night owl, he is a lark but we got past all that so I am sure the TV thing will work itself out. For right now, it is better for me to turn off the TV before I even try to sleep, but for him it is better to leave it on. Take care, Annette""I am sorry, I can only guess what you mean in your posts as you have not made it into sentences or use punctuation. I assume you have had a number of spinal surgeries, and are now using Opana for pain and it is not working. You also have bipolar disorder, and feel very depressed. If you are on a lot of mental health meds, still depressed, and also in pain and the Opana is not working for you, I am not sure you are even capable of giving informed consent for surgery at this time. If I were you, or if you were my friend/family, I would suggest you see your psychiatrist first and get your bipolar disorder under better control, then see the PM doctor and get your pain under better control. Once you are past this crisis you can decide about more spinal surgery. I think it is more a matter of what dose you use for the Opana than using a ""stronger"" pain med. The PM doctor may be reluctant to give you more because you are taking Ativan or other mental health meds. I don<APO>t know, ask him directly why he feels it is not the time to increase your dose or change the type of pain meds you take. Take a deep breath, and try and settle yourself a bit. Take care, Annette""I would not bother to discuss meds with a surgeon, but rather discuss it with a pain management doctor or whoever writes your Opana RXs. All a surgeon will tell you is if he thinks he can do surgery, and if it will improve your pain. Take care, Annette""Tolerance resets after you stop using opiates, so there really is not much reason to believe that you still had a high tolerance when you started using opiates after 3 years off of them. The fact may be that your pain was simply worse than it was before. You don<APO>t say how ofter you take MS Contin 45 mg. but even at three times a day, that isn<APO>t a very high dose. Some research I have read in my nursing journal suggests that often the need for higher doses of opiates for pain is more related to the disease process than tolerance to the opiates. I think it is a good idea to follow up with your other referrals and see what they say. Always get a second opinion for any kind of elective surgery, so if the neurosurgeon or the ortho doc suggest surgery, I would see a second unrelated doctor to make sure it is the right thing to do. Any time you fall, you run the risk of damaging the neck of your femur and developing AVN in the head. The ortho doc should be able to see that on imaging studies. My husband fell on his hip and developed that and later required a hip replacement. It worked well and he went back to work quickly and in nearly no pain. Take care, Annette""Yes, you can ingest it in your food. You can make butter with it inside and then use the butter for making baked goods. My friends just added it to cookie batter or brownie batter and baked it up and ate it, slowly. It can be very difficult to titrate the correct dose by eating it as the symptom relief can be much slower. There are ways and paraphernalia for smoking it without getting the smoke directly into your longs from a joint or pipe. Do your research and you will find many ways of using it. I did not find it useful for pain relief, either smoked or eaten. I got high and did not like that much either. I have not used it in many, many years. Take care, Annette""None of my doctors have ever mentioned that to me regarding chronic pain before. I had migraines and they were (correctly) quick to point out the dangers of rebound headaches when using migraine meds, including over the counter meds more than three days a week. I would get a second opinion from a Pain Management Specialist. Take care, Annette""Perhaps instead of telling him that you have too much pain on your present regimen of OTC meds, try telling him what kinds of activities you would like to be able to participate in that your current level of pain prevents you from doing. Sometimes approaching it from a functional standpoint is better than just saying you have too much pain. If this is something you have already done, I am sorry, I don<APO>t have any other suggestions except try a different doctor. If he can<APO>t help you, ask for a referral to someone who can. As far as how your liver tolerates the OTC meds, we are all different, the doses he suggested are within the usual range. Make sure he does liver studies with your regular lab work. Take care, Annette""Many people get what are called ""post-coital migraines"", these are migraines that commonly happen with sexual intercourse or with masturbation. It is possible to get a migraine rescue med from your doctor to take prior to intercourse to prevent this headache. You will need a prescription. Doctors have heard everything so don<APO>t feel embarrassed about telling him what you have told us. Of course, he will check your blood pressure just to make sure, but these headaches that come with intercourse are not usually related to high blood pressure. You did not mention your age, but it is wise for everyone to check their blood pressure occasionally just to make sure that it is not creeping upwards. High blood pressure is called the silent killer because there are usually no symptoms until you have a heart attack or stroke. Take care, Annette""Rather than going to the ER, visit your own doctor or establish yourself with one. They are not nearly as pricey as the ER and it is far more appropriate. You don<APO>t have to wait until you are in pain to go. Take care, Annette""This is also my experience, A doctor can choose to treat someone or not, just like we can choose to see a particular doctor or not. Having a medical collaboration is a mutual decision by the doctor and the patient. Of course, like you said if a doctor is working in the ER he has to see anyone who comes in. But, on the other hand, the ER should give everyone who comes in the name and number of a doctor for follow up. In my limited experience that doctor must see someone who is referred by the ER, but he doesn<APO>t have to see you more than once and you still have to pay him. I would make a point to make a good impression at that visit. Take care, Annette""Talk to your doctor about your fears. I am sure he will be able to reassure you. I don<APO>t think ""hydrocodiene"" is available in the US, but I believe that you are on a low dose, even after 10 years so I doubt anyone would think you are a drug abuser. Would you mind checking the spelling on the RX bottle so we all know for sure what you have? Hydrocodone is available in the US but it comes in combination with other meds. Take care, Annette""I would get at least one other opinion before deciding what to do. I was told many years ago I had thoracic outlet syndrome, turned out I must not have had it, because I never received any treatment and the pain drifted away. Ask the doctor what all your treatment options are, in addition to surgery. They are supposed to tell you. If it is not an emergency, think about it and talk to lots of doctors and others with TOS before you decide anything. Ask the doctor if it can cause an emergency and what symptoms you need to be aware of in case that happens. Take care, Annette""According to this article, and it goes along with what I knew already, it can be caused by an impingement of the blood vessels OR an impingement of the nerves. I was seeing a neuroligist when I was told I had it, he believed it was due to nerves being ""trapped"". Take care, Annette""I am glad you are feeling better. May I ask what was in the ""shot"" the doctor gave you? Take care, Annette""It is interesting. I had read that it was best to keep your acetaminophen levels below 2,000 mg. per day if taken long term. Other liver specialists have told me as long as a doctor is monitoring you carefully, he would go much higher than is usually recommended. I personally have eliminated it from my med list entirely. I think the less I take the better off I will be. Take care, Annette""It has been my understanding that one should not take Motrin (ibuprofen), and Celebrex (celecoxib), at the same time because both are NSAIDs. I am curious about what your doctor says about this? What is your diagnosis? If you don<APO>t mind sharing. There is a sound alike antidepressant called Celexa, it is sometimes used in pain patients. I took many kinds of NSAIDs back in the early 1990s and settled on ibuprofen, I took up to 3600 mg. per day. It worked the best for me, and did not cause any stomach upset. I have found that Tylenol (acetaminophen) just doesn<APO>t work for me, so I don<APO>t even keep it in the house. It is good that you have found a combination that works for you. I am in the same place, with different meds, but it is working for me as much as anything ever has. Take care, Annette""Please talk to your doctor about the combination you are currently using. Unfortunately, with NSAIDs, the stomach problem can start with severe bleeding. My doctor and I discussed what that meant for me, and how to be aware of it so I would get seen right away if anything bad happened. Take care, Annette""Ask your mom or guardian to take you to see your doctor about this. If you don<APO>t have a sports doctor already it sounds like that might be a good idea. Asking you to do an entirely new move in 13 days, that you must stretch through pain for, is not a good idea. All new pain should be evaluated by a doctor (not a dance teacher). Take care, Annette""This is a question for your surgeon, did you ask him if this is common? If you are concerned make another appt. and speak to him about this. I have not had this procedure done, but I have had surgery and continued to have some twinges and pain for a year or so down the line. It sounds like you are talking about more pain than this though... Take care, Annette""My personal opinion is that surgeons like to think they have fixed things, especially if an imaging test shows healing. They do not understand pain very well, they are not trained to manage chronic pain. I would go to a pain management specialist who does all kinds of pain control including oral meds, biofeedback, PT, OT, psychological therapy, and interventional things like injections and surgical procedures. No one is insane just because they complain of pain. Take care, Annette""It is not a lose/lose situation. Surgeon cut, that is what they do and that is what they are trained to do. They do not manage chronic pain. Any pain that lasts longer than 3-6 months is considered chronic. It is important to address this pain now, and not wait until later. I know you feel discouraged, but please try a pain management specialist???? Take care, Annette""Congratulations on the new member of your family!! Please do not add marijuana to the mix of drugs you are already on. The time to discuss this with your OB doctor is now. Have a plan ready and follow what she/he suggests. Only you and your doctor can decide whether it is better for you and your baby to withdraw from drugs while the baby is still inside you or after it is born. Unless ""personal research"" includes peer reviewed journal articles about double blind medical studies regarding MJ and Ambien or Fentanyl, I would ignore it. Or print it out if you think it is worthwhile and take it to your doctor to discuss. Remember that studies that only have small numbers of participants are really no good statistically. So a study with 30 participants may not even be worth reading as far as making personal medical decisions. Those kinds of studies are only good as a basis for further studies. I really don<APO>t think it is that big a deal to have a healthy baby that needs observation vs. taking it home immediately. I think I would just be glad everything is okay. I know it can be a financial burden though. Take care, Annette""Fentanyl is also listed as a Class C drug in my drug handbook. Humira is a Class B. That said I would think she has told her OB doctor about what meds she is on. Sometimes doctors leave patients on their meds and just manipulate them during the pregnancy or change them, of watch the patient closely. Take care, Annette""Surgery often does not fix back pain and it may continue to worsen after surgery. Read the label of the medicine carefully, if it says Oxycontin and says to take as needed, I would go see the doctor and ask him to clarify how many a day he means. This drug in this delivery system is meant to be taken two or three times a day, but on a set schedule, not as needed. It is made to be slowly released over time, it is considered a long acting opiate that lasts for 8-12 hours. If however, the label says oxycodone and not Oxycontin, then it may be taken as needed. Many people get these two names mixed up and/or use them interchangably. This med is short acting and is released all at once into your blood stream. It generally lasts for 4-6 hours. There is no set dose for this kind of drug. As one takes it over the years, ones body may build up a tolerance to the drug, and it may take a higher dose to get the same effect. The dose is individualized to each person. The right dose for her is the one that gives her the best pain relief and the fewest side effects. Take care, Annette""This is something to discuss with her pcp first of all. Then if he/she can<APO>t help her ask for a referral to someone who can help. I would start with a neurologist or orthopedic doctor. Besides checking for obvious things in her shoulder/neck/back, if she has a large bust, that can also cause upper back spasms. Also something to talk to her pcp about. Take care, Annette""I would get a second opinion with another rheumatologist. Someone unrelated to the first, not in the same office. If you get the same response, I would see a pain management specialist and see what he says. Take care, Annette""Hi, Bet No worries, I am fine, Some people are in different places than we are, along their path to recovery (whatever that is?). Thanks for the compliment though. Hugs, Annette""Hi, Debi Thank you for the nice words. Everyone here is at their own place along the path that we all walk. I am always glad to be of help. Hugs, Annette""Let me know what the PM doctor decides to do for your pain. There are RA specific meds that can control this disorder. Take care, Annette""If you feel at the mercy of your doctors, maybe you need new and different doctors?? Just a thought. Take care, Annette""I did, years ago. It did not help my pain at all. I tried it by inhalation and by dietary MJ. Take care, Annette""I assume you have already seen a neurologist? I would use a variety of meds together and also use non-drug treatments, like heat, exercise, and a TENS unit.Get a bit of help from each of several modalities and see if you do better than when you use none. Take care, Annette""In my drug handbook under dosing for pain conditions it says that doses of 120 mg. per day in trials ""offered no additional benefit and were less well tolerated than dose of 60 mg./day."" That said they do use 120 mg. per day for anxiety, but they also note that ""doses >60 mg./day have not been demonstrated to be more effective."" Once a medication is fully approved by the FDA there are generally no restrictions on dosing. As doctors use the drug, they decide how to adjust the dose and how high to go. I use a bit more zolpidem than was originally advised and it works for me. I don<APO>t get any side effects. As long as you are aware of the potential side effects and report them to your doctor immediately, decide for yourself what to do. Take care, Annette""Anytime you have difficulty breathing you should see a doctor so he can evaluate you. Take care, Annette""My only suggestion is to treat it like a job: find a doctor first, then move. If you can<APO>t find a doctor after you get there, what are you going to do? Also will you be doing anything for your grandma that requires a nursing license? If so, get a Florida license ahead of time also. It is usually not hard to get a license if you already have one in your home state, but it depends on the state licensing rules. Do not count on getting Medicaid without checking out the state rules first. Up where I live, a single adult in your age group would probably end up on a waiting list for the lottery for state health care. It also may limit your choice of doctors. If you are looking for doctor<APO>s names, numbers, etc. you need to post an email address, it may be best to get a throw away one. Take care, Annette""Many studies have shown that there is little correlation between the MRIs and the level of back pain one feels. People with MRIs that show horrible changes may have no pain at all, and people with normal spines per the MRI may have terrible symptoms. FMS can be a pain amplitude kind of problem, so if you have pain from some other cause it may be increased when compared to someone without FMS. Or you may have pain for NO reason at all. It can move from place to place for seemingly no reason at all. My favorite FMS site is http://www.myalgia.com , they give lots of information about FMS. You might go there and do some reading before deciding if it seems like a reasonable diagnosis for you. You can print out the info to share with your doctor. Take care, Annette""Hi, Beth Medicare is a nationwide program. I know because I have it. I have never had to pay for a doctor up front. I have seen several doctors by referral for surgery, and they all billed Medicare themselves, I paid a small copay, maybe up to $25 but even that was billed to me later. I saw a surgeon, a pain management doctor, and a hematologist, in addition to my pcp. That was just plain old-fashioned Medicare. This year I signed up with an AARP Medicare Advantage program, and I pay $15 for my regular doctor<APO>s visit, and $25 for a specialist, as a copay at the time of the appt. I had breast reduction surgery and had to pay nothing at all to the surgeon above my copays for my office visits. Doctors are required to tell you if they don<APO>t bill Medicare or even if they choose not to use it at all. Take care, Annette""Thank you for your military service. My son was in active duty with the Marines for eight years, and did three deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq. He messed up one shoulder also, among other things. You need to post an email address and do this privately. We are not allowed to post doctors<APO> names, addresses, etc. Get one of those Yahoo or Hotmail addresses that you don<APO>t use for personal stuff so you don<APO>t get spammed. I wish you all my best. Take care, Annette""I am sorry, I do not know anything about the surgery you are considering. Ask the neurosurgeon for sites you can check this kind of stuff. The website of the hospital where he does it might be useful. They often post newer surgical procedures. Trigeminal neuralgia is difficult to treat.Someone who used to post here used Lidoderm patches for neurological facial pain. She said she cut them up to fit the areas on her face that were bothering her and just stuck them on. She said she looked funny, but it worked for her. Because of her, I asked my doctor about these patches and she prescribed them for me also. I have Fibromyalgia and DDD. I use the patches on my feet, legs, and hip. They are a help to me for certain kinds of pain. You might discuss this with your doctor, there are cautions that should be taken as with any drug. I would also look up Nucynta and see what they say about using it as needed rather than on a schedule. I have never used that medicine myself. Take care, Annette""You might also try an antiseizure medicine like gabapentin or Lyrica. They might help with this neurological pain, if you have not already done so. It sounds from all the treatments you have had already that you have really run out of options. I would suggest using anything that worked even a little bit. Try different combinations to see if you get better relief. Take care, Annette""This happened to my mom when she was on steroids for her brain tumor. She was put on insulin for awhile. She had no prior history of diabetes. Talk to your doctor right away. Take care, Annette""Everyone is different. I have severe DDD of my cervical spine. I had one discectomy when I started losing function of my dominant hand. I was still working in the ER and only had the surgery so I could keep working. I was literally dropping things regularly. The surgery fixed that. The disc above the operative one herniated six months later, I did not opt to have that one surgically fixed. The sensory symptoms returned with that herniation, but both hands continued to work fine. My neurosurgeon did not recommend spinal surgery for pain management, he felt the odds were against the patient when you factored in the risks and possible benefits. He would only do it for functional deficits. Since then further medical studies have shown that with arthritis of the spine, or DDD, surgery does not offer any additional benefits to more conservative treatment. But, you had trauma to your spine, so you and I are not in the same boat as far as medical history goes. That is why I think everyone should TALK to their own doctors, and do their own research and make that decision for themselves. If I were guaranteed pain relief after a short course of postop pain and no other complications, I would go for it too. But there are no guarantees of postop pain relief or an absence of complications, so I pass. I had a DVT with the first discectomy, an extra week in the hospital and 6 months on coumadin, that<APO>s enough to turn me off from more orthopedic surgery. Surgeons cut, that is their main way of dealing with problems. As long as you have had a second opinion with an unrelated surgeon, and seen a neurologist for other treatment options, you have all the info, you just have to decide what to do. Take your time and think it through. You are smart and educated, YOU will make the right decision for YOU. Hugs, Annette""I had a consult with a hematologist before I had the breast reduction surgery in January. They can do a battery of tests to look for any as yet unseen reasons for a DVT. They did all that and he came to the conclusion that mine was probably due to the length of the surgery and the fact that it was an orthopedic surgery as well. He felt those were the two risk factors that probably lead to the DVT. Just my luck, in other words. But no reason to freak out at the surgery I was looking at. He did not say I should take Lovinox, but it is standard for the plastic surgeon I used for that kind of surgery. So I gave myself the injections in my thighs for one week. If DVTs freak you out, I would suggest seeing a hematologist ahead of time and getting all the info you can. My surgeon insisted I see one because I had a history of the one DVT. Even though he did not tell me anything I did not already suspect, it was reassuring. They didn<APO>t even have those kinds of tests 10-15 years ago. They didn<APO>t even have Lovinox around when I had my spinal surgery. I have had a total of four surgeries, and only had the DVT with the one, but it is scary, especially for those of us who know what can happen. I totally trust that you will decide the right thing for you when the time comes. Hugs, Annette PS, I took care of my nephew when he was in a body cast for 8 weeks, if he could do it, so can you. But, I would choose the winter, not summertime, lol.""I am a retired nurse too, and I agree with Beth. I would not let any insurance company nurse accompany me or coerce me into anything. Be very careful, as Beth said she works for the insurance company, and tries to save them money. That is well and good to a certain extent. But do not let them do anything medically that you don<APO>t believe will help you. I am not a big fan of Botox, I think it is vastly overused. But if nothing else works and you want to give it a try, make sure your doctor is experienced in giving the injections. It is OKAY to ask him up front about his level of experience, success, and side effects. Take care, Annette""Before I had cervical spinal surgery, I used a home traction set up. The doctor told me how much weight to use, and the traction bag held water and was marked so I would get the proper amount of weight. I found using this on an over the door frame was very helpful for pain management. I used about 10 pounds of weight for about 20 minutes several times a day. I was working back then and could not take opiates and do my job. I tried acupuncture, and for me it did not work. My pcp at the time, whom I trusted and liked, said it helped about half the pain patients he sent, and worked for several months. He thought it was worth a try. I do suggest one try it, and give it 6-8 weeks for an honest try. I do not recommend chiropractors for herniated discs and spurs. My husband<APO>s chiropractor told me to stay away from chiropractors after checking out my MRI films and taking my history, he never adjusted my spine at all. We both liked and trusted this chiropractor. I adore our little hot tub, it also makes a big difference in how I handle my pain. Take care, Annette""I agree with Beth. I think that all the different splints and braces that are available in the local drug stores should only be used with a doctor<APO>s instruction. Lots of them can cause more harm than benefit if used incorrectly or on the wrong person. Take care, Annette""The only suggestion I have is to go see a free/low cost clinic in your area, and see if they can hook you up with a doctor. You can do a search on line in your preferred search engine, just type in ""free/low cost clinic in (the name of your town)"". I think what some folks said is that a disc problem can present itself with pain in the hip/groin area, rather than with pain in the lower back. I would not presume to try and diagnose you on line, you just cannot do that accurately, even if I were a doctor and I am not. Take care, Annette""Are there any randomized, double blind studies that show these techniques work, and show a success rate of 90% of patients being permanently pain free? I want to see evidence based medical studies, not anecdotal stuff. Just be sure you all also read the Google search results for both positive and negative perspectives of these therapies. Then decide for yourself. I do this for any new treatment I try. Quackwatch.com is an eye opener for many therapies. Take care, Annette""I have had DDD/herniated discs of the neck for upwards of 20 years. I know the grinding you are describing, but frankly, I have never had it. I don<APO>t think the ""white outs"" are related to the neck problem, I would tend to agree with the doctor who suggested proper hydration and diet. I would also suggest moving very slowly so your body can prepare and be ready to stand up. I agree with Dave, see a neurologist and get a basic diagnosis and treatment plan in order. I can make my arms go numb by holding my neck a certain way, but my goal is to not have them go numb, so I avoid what bothers me. As far as the exercises, you have to pretty much do them for life, you won<APO>t see any results for several months of doing them daily. Have you done them that long? Take care, Annette""My medical text says that one would get tender nodules at the outset of this syndrome, but as it goes along the pain becomes less and less. I would wonder if he has something else in addition tot he Dupuytren<APO>s Contratures??? I would check this out with a hand specialist or a rheumatologist. It suggests injections of steroids and early surgery as the best treatment options. This is something where putting off surgery could be detrimental as far as the outcome goes. Make sure he tells the doctor what kinds of activities are being hampered by this problem and how important they are to him. Take care, Annette""The text I have suggests surgery when you can no longer lay you hand flat on a table. If he can<APO>t use his hands at all, it seems like it might be time to check in with a hand surgeon for a second opinion. Best of luck to you both. Take care, Annette""I totally agree with you college professor about bad questions. Unfortunately, there are bad doctors out there. My husband saw one, I was present. He looked at my husband<APO>s xray films and said he agreed with his pcp that he needed a hip replacement. He never laid a hand on my husband or did any kind of examination. Later we got a copy of his report for W/C and he had all kinds of measurements and wrote that he examined him and measured this and that, things he never did. He totally ignored me when I told him my husband had a chronic infected wound on his other leg, and he wanted to set a date for surgery in two weeks. We left and got another orthopedic doctor. I had checked him out completely ahead of time. My husband saw 2-3 surgeons I had checked out and picked one that he liked. Happily he is doing great now, is fully recovered from his surgery (it was done four years ago, after the wound finally healed). Do your own research, always. Take care, Annette""Hi, nanat4 Just remember there are no guarantees with any surgery. Any doctor who says ""his"" patients always get better is a liar and not to be trusted. I had one cervical spinal surgery that I consider successful. Make sure your expectations are reasonable. Spinal surgery is always a crapshoot, there is no way to tell for sure what will happen with anyone after surgery. MRIs do not pick out the right patients for surgery. Do your research and talk to others who have had your type of problems. It is not an emergency type of surgery, you do have time to figure this all out. Take care, Annette""Hi, Chronic1008 Like you I really believe it is all in your expectations about surgery. I think everyone getting elective surgery should check out their surgeon and ask a lot of questions. I think spinal surgery is worth the risk if I am dealing with a loss of function, but not for pain. That said, I have never gotten as much pain or to the amount of meds you were taking. That is just me, not you. Everyone has to make this decision with their own surgeon. Don<APO>t worry about me or anyone else re-reading your story. There are always newer people around who will get something from your story. We older folks, may also get something new. Take care, Annette""I do not have any problem with taking pain pills as long as I need them. I do not get any reaction to them, except they decrease the amount of pain that I have. I follow the least invasive treatment plan my doctor can provide me with. My choice. It is a surgery for the pain med pump, and requires a refill every now and then. Many people require oral meds in addition to the pump, I am glad you do not, it seems to me to not be worth the trouble if you do. If it is a good choice for you, good deal. Thanks for your input. Take care, Annette""I am sorry, but some surgeons are not in it for the patient<APO>s best interest. My husband needed a hip replacement, we already knew that when we saw the xray that showed the femoral head totally collapsed from AVN. I am an RN. The problem was that he also had a chronic Staph infection in a wound on his opposite leg, the wound was open and dressed with gauze of course. The surgeon said he would schedule surgery for two weeks from then, no comment when I asked him about the Staph infection, he never looked at it, never laid a hand on my husband except to shake his hand. Did no examination of any kind. When he sent his report to the primary doc, he claimed to have done all kinds of measurements, etc. We were charged for a complete first time exam, several hundred dollars. If the insurance company had not paid for it, we would have complained. My husband just wanted out of there. We never went back. We went to another orthopedic surgeon who agreed to do the surgery only when the wound was completely healed for three months, a second surgeon said the same thing. He had successful hip replacement surgery three years ago, several months after the wound finally healed. He had to have vascular surgery before it finally healed. Thank God, no infections of any kind since. The orthopedic surgeon that my husband first saw was just in it for the money. However, with decent screening there are lots of fine doctors out there to choose from. I have had the same doctor for over 15 years now, you just must screen them carefully. But, use your own head too. Take care, Annette""You need to discuss this with your doctor. Having headaches after one reaches climax is not unusual at all, often taking a prescription migraine rescue med just before having sex will prevent it. Since you are already on BP meds, I would check your BP when you begin to have a headache, write it down. Don<APO>t take any additional meds without talking to your doctor about this first. It is important for the doctor to know all the meds you are on and your medical history before he treats you. Your doctor has probably heard of this kind of thing before, so don<APO>t be shy, speak up and tell him what is going on. Take care, Annette""All I can suggest is to call your doctor. AVN is tough, the only definitive treatment that I am aware of is a total hip replacement. My husband had AVN and had a hip replacement three years ago, it has been a miracle for us. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""I usually read my Kindle. My doctor<APO>s office has a variety of magazines to read, but I went to a university medical center<APO>s ortho clinic with my husband, and there was not one single magazine, or newspaper there. It was bring your own stuff, or do without. We went home and boxed up a bunch of food magazines and National Geographics, and sent them to the office. Hugs, Annette""In addition to what others have said, some states offer disability insurance that you pay for by way of payroll deduction. Calif. is one, but many states do not offer this. Take care, Annette""I would not accept Demerol myself. It metabolizes in the body and the metabolites can cause problems including seizures. Toxicity has been noted even with occasional use. There are other pain meds that work well. I would talk to the doctor again. You can just tell him that the Demerol is too difficult to obtain if you feel uncomfortable confronting him. Take care, Annette""Hi, Charles I think all he was saying is we should get all the information up front, and then decide for ourselves what to take. I think that is reasonable. As far as people dying of having lasting organ damage from opiates, I agree with you. I have been a nurse for forty years, and never heard or read about it, let alone witnessed it. I would not however use that ""natural substance"" thing. Cocaine and curare are made from ""natural substances"" both can kill humans. So can many other ""natural substances"". Thanks for your input, as usual. Take care, Annette""I agree with you about everyone knowing the possible risk/benefit ratio of any medication or treatment they may opt to have. A lessening of bowel peristalsis is fairly common due to opioid use, this commonly causes constipation, but I can see where Ogilvie<APO>s Syndrome could be part of that continuum. It would be something I would be concerned about. I use stimulent type laxatives to counter the effects of the opioids I use, but I am much more aware of by bowels than most younger adults are. Never thought I would say that! Perforated bowels due to Ogilvie<APO>s Syndrome are easily seen to be related to long term opioid use. Do you see kidney, liver, or other GI complications that are as directly connected? I am aware of the arrythmias seen in methadone patients, particularly at higher doses. Although I have been a nurse for many years, and do a lot of reading. I have been out of ICU for many years also. Nursing care as with all medical science is constantly evolving, I can remember when asthma was thought to be entirely emotional and patients with it were told to ""just calm down"" and not given much in the way of meds, lol. My great aunt was a RN in Calif. and graduated from nursing school in 1915, hearing her war stories was something else. She was a scrub nurse at the first conjoined twin separation in SF when they thought that was nearly impossible to do successfully. Never worry about starting an argument here, people are fairly civilized, and we often agree to disagree. How would we learn anything new, if we all agreed about everything? Besides that is what the moderators are for, lol. Take care, Annette""I hope it all works out well for you. Keep in mind that it can take several adjustments of pain meds to find just the right combination, so see your doctor as often as needed for the first few months on the new meds. It sounds like you have a nice relationship with your doctor, do not be afraid to do your own research on good medical sites and share that with him. My doctor like for me to do as much reading as I can on my own illnesses, she is good about trying or not trying things that I suggest. She always tells me why if she does not want to try something new that I bring her. Take care, Annette""I agree that any substance you put into your body has the ability to have both positive and negative effects. Where may we find these studies that you discussed, so we may all evaluate their quality and outcomes? Do you have links to them, or the names of the studies or their authors? Take care, Annette""I Googled this title, and found a bunch of interesting articles that used it in their bibliographies, but never found a link to the article itself. I totally agree with you that people should know all they can about ALL drugs they take, and what they take together, and only then decide what path to take. Take care, Annette""Yes, I am interested, just can<APO>t afford to pay a subscription fee for every article I would like to read. Take care, Annette""I am not sure that all of the pain and swelling you are experiencing is from a bulging disc. I would check in with your doctor and ask him what he suggests. Take care, Annette""Just because you don<APO>t require surgery, it does not mean you will just get worse and stay in pain. What does your neurologist suggest you do? Take care, Annette""Unless you see him again, you won<APO>t know what he would suggest for a treatment plan, now that the surgeon has said surgery is not right for you. The die test they did with the CT scan may show the doctor exactly what the bulging disc is pressing on, if anything. I had one of those once, shortly before I had surgery for a herniated disc at C5-6. It just gave the doctor more information than he got from an regular scan. I assume by ""fribiro"" you mean Fibromyalgia, also shortened to fibro or FMS. This can make treating any painful stimuli a bit more challenging. But, not impossible. I have DDD or DJD (different doctors use different terms) of my cervical spine and FMS also. My pain is adequately treated, and I live a happy, fulfilled life, though I cannot work as a nurse anymore. That was a hard transition, but I got through it. Take care, Annette""You take care of yourself. You will get through this just fine. Do what you can do to help yourself, and follow your doctor<APO>s instructions (after you do your own research, of course). Take care, Annette""It is hard to tell if the pills made your pain worse, or if it just happened to get worse while you were taking them, and would have anyway. Tell your doctor and see what he says. Take care, Annette""Not all pain management doctors manage migraines though. I saw a PM doctor for pain fro FMS, and asked him about migraine treatment, and he was honest enough to say that it was a different specialty, and he knew nothing about migraines. I would just ask before you make an appt. if he treats migraines too. Take care, Annette""Hi, Beth This was interesting. It was NEVER suggested to me during my treatment for migraines, even at the worst time when it seemed like nothing would help. I saw good doctors in Reno and even went to the UC-SF Medical Center neurology clinic and saw a neurologist there. I probably saw my pcp and several neurologists and a pain management doctor in Reno back then, and then my pcp in southern Oregon and a neurosurgeon/pain management doctor there, and my pcp here. I had read about it, but it was considered experimental when I researched it before. Thanks for posting the article. Hugs, Annette The article did say that more research was needed for this kind of intervention before it was regularly used for migraine prevention/treatment.""Thank you for supplying this link. The article was very interesting. I will look for the two studies they mentioned that were in progress at the time of the article. They had enough patients to be statistically meaningful. Take care, Annette""Interesting, I just read an article in a pain management email that I get that said older adults were in fact more likely to have pain left untreated by their doctors than younger adults. I think perhaps it is all in ones own perspective. Take care, Annette""It is probably easier for me to say now, but just keep on going. You will find a treatment path that works for you. I would never have believed anyone who told me that when my migraines were at their worst. I still get them, but now I can manage them better than I did back then. I cannot do everything I could before migraines arrived when I was 35, but I can do some other things that I never would have done. Actually, the research I read on Botox some years ago, said only 50% of the patients got 50% pain relief from these injections. Those odds are not that great. Perhaps, they have studies now that show improved outcomes, I don<APO>t know. Take care, Annette""You clearly state that medications do not help you at all, so do NOT accept the RX when they try to give it to you??? I had migraines up to 4 times a week and was working as an RN in the ER and mothering a young son and being a wife. It sucks but it is possible. If you have done all this research about migraines, you have read that opiates are NOT a good treatment for migraines. After you try every medicine available for a preventative for 4-6 weeks to get optimal relief, if it does not work, you move on to pairing them and trying different pairs for 4-6 weeks. You do the same thing with rescue meds. Migraines and insomnia are not simple conditions to treat, they are very complex. There may not be a magic pill that will make all this ""suffering"" go away. I mentioned to you, or someone with a very similar story, that you need to try cognitive behavioral therapy, biofeedback, etc. Things that require work on your part. I would also suggest that you stick to one doctor for all your treatment, it is safer and you are likely to get better results. Best of luck. Take care, Annette""On the other hand, I had the same symptoms twice, five years apart, and both time they went away completely after 8-12 weeks. No surgery, no MRIs, no nothing except Xrays, and a bit of oral prednisone the second time. Watchful waiting, my orthopedist called it. But, I did go see him and we had a plan for if the symptoms did not go away. Swank is right, you need a proper examination by an orthopedic specialist. Take care, Annette""What did you say when you asked him why he changed your treatment program after giving you break through pain meds? There are two bones in your lower leg, the larger tibia and the smaller fibula. Oddly enough, people can and do walk around on fractured fibulas as they are not the weight bearing bones. Getting an xray of your lower leg was the least and probably the most easily explained of his actions. Take care, Annette""I have FMS, and it could be what you have, but a doctor usually has to do a lot of different tests to eliminate other possible causes of your symptoms. My favorite medical site for FMS is at http://www.myalgia.com . I have found lots of solid information there. It is not an interactive site like this one, just lots of articles about FMS and its diagnosis and treatment. You can print out anything you find there that seems to resonate with you, and show it to your doctor. Dr. Robert Bennett, MD is the rheumatologist there, he is well known in the FMS community as a doctor who treats and does research on FMS. Take care, Annette""My doctor did the following just to rule out any other possible diagnosis when he decided I had FMS: Thyroid panel (TSH, T3,T4), CBC, ANA, RA factor, Liver panel including tests for the various kinds of hepatitis, TB skin test, and HIV. I had already had MRIs and CT scans done of my head and cervical spine due to other problems, so he didn<APO>t repeat anything. That covers thyroid problems, Lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, various liver problems, TB, and HIV/AIDS. All of those things can cause similar symptoms at some point in their development: pain and fatigue. My doctor had also taken care of me for nearly 10 years, so he knew me and my family pretty well. That makes it easier for him to make a diagnosis. Good luck to you. Take care, Annette""I did a sleep study also, I forgot about that one. The neurologist who ordered it just told me it was fine, but never gave me the report. It turned out, I have so many Alpha wave intrusions into the Delta sleep patterns that it supported my regular doctor<APO>s diagnose of FMS. I didn<APO>t find out until SSA requested all my medical records for SSDI a few years later. It was a very interesting test, I never imagined being able to sleep hooked up to all those machines and wires. I was also a night nurse at the time, so my sleep schedule was opposite the norm. Of course, once I finally went to sleep for a little bit, they woke me up and told me they had what they needed and I could go home. It was just before 5 AM. I had fallen asleep just 3-4 hours before. But, like I said they got a bunch of good data. I would ask for the report, and also read up on the process and what is normal and what isn<APO>t. Sleep apnea needs to be ruled out, as it can cause some symptoms similar to FMS. That is one of the reasons they do it. Sleep apnea is fairly easily treated and things improve fairly quickly if all you need is a CPAP machine. Take care, Annette""My opinion of any test, especially the expensive ones, is if the results would make a difference in my treatment plan, I might consider it. Otherwise I won<APO>t. My understanding of a discogram is that it is only done just prior to surgery to pinpoint the area to be worked on, so if I would not be considering surgery at this point, then I would decline. If I was willing to have surgery, then I would ask what information would be gotten from this procedure, and how would it impact on my care. I had spinal surgery on my neck and never had a discogram at all. I have also heard they are extremely painful. Don<APO>t feel rushed, this is not an emergency, you should take your time and do your research before you make decisions about invasive procedures. You might see a neurologist and ask for all your treatment options, surgical and otherwise. A second surgical opinion is always a good idea too. Take care, Annette""I went and read this article and then Googled ""biacuplasty"". One article I found about the research on this subject quoted a study with only 13 patients followed for only 6 months. They had 50% decrease in pain for 50% of the patients. It is an invasive procedure, so there can be complications like drug reactions and infection like with all invasive procedures. Also I imagine there could be injury done if the probes were placed incorrectly. They were recruiting patients for another study in Canada. I could not see where they have improved their ability to tell just which patients will respond to this intervention. The big problem with back pain is that MRIs and CT scans are not very good for diagnosing which pains are coming from diseased discs and which are not. I don<APO>t think discograms are a whole lot better at sorting this out. This is one of those things where I would wait much longer and see what the research shows. It may turn out to be great or it may not. At least it is another alternative. Take care, Annette""I had a cervical discectomy in 1991. I had it because I was losing the function in my dominant hand, not for pain. It was successful in that my function returned. My neurologist did not believe in doing disc surgery for pain relief, because he felt the odds of getting significant relief were too low to make it worth the risks involved with this type of surgery. From everything I have read since then, it is still about 50/50 that you have any significant pain reduction. They just have not been able to find a way to tell which are the patients the surgery will help and which ones it won<APO>t help. I did not have a surgical fusion done. My doctor just removed the disc and allowed the two vertebrae to fuse together naturally. I had xrays done at six months that showed they had done that. This approach has more risk at the beginning while the spine is less stable, but the recovery is much faster and you have much less postop pain. I was back to work as an ER nurse working full time, 12 hour shifts, in 6 weeks with no restrictions other than not lifting above my shoulder height. The disc above the one he operated on herniated six months later, and I opted not to have surgery on that one as I have had no functional deficits. My neck is the neck of a 90 year old according to my doctors, and has been for nearly 20 years, I am only 58. I have all the stuff you do in my neck. I had a blood clot after surgery and would only do it again if I had functional problems, not for pain. That is just my choice. Get a second opinion from a neurosurgeon who is not associated with your current doctor. Take care, Annette""I had cervical disc surgery done back in 1992, my surgeon did not even ask me to do this procedure. Other surgeons were asking other patients to do it back then for the same reasons you see now. I agree with Swank, it is barbaric and unnecessary. Take care, Annette""I am with Charles, I have had spinal surgery, but never had a discogram. My doctor never brought it up at all. I would also decline. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t think this is related to DDD either. It is fairly easy for a doctor to look at your MRIs and other scans and tell what nerves are affected in your spine, then they just follow that nerve down and will be able to tell what parts of you will likely be affected. I have migraines, that cause facial numbness occasionally. I have had migraines that felt like a stroke, gait changes, facial numbness, etc. I had one cervical disc surgically fixed and bone spurs removed, it made no difference with my headaches at all. Take care, Annette""Why do you think your meds are ""ridiculous""? Everyone has different pain and experiences it differently. You are on a fairly high dose of methadone and oxycodone for BT pain. If it is not doing the job, tell the doctor what you would like to be able to do that you cannot do now because of the pain? Make it more a question of function with specific goals to attain. I wish everyone knew what steroids could do as far as bad side effects, they might be less willing to take them. Sometimes, as in your case, they may be necessary, but often they are not. At that dose of methadone, I hope you are getting yearly EKGs. Methadone can cause arrythmias that can lead to death. My PM specialist suggested a yearly EKG to me. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know what tests you had done to determine the ""therapeutic level"" for methadone. The only blood test I have had for opioids was to check to see if the amount in my blood stream correlated with the amount I was taking. It is my understanding that the therapeutic amount of opioids is the amount that relieves your pain without causing side effects that would preclude you from taking it. Because of tolerance that amount may change from person to person and from one time to another for the same person. 180 mg. of methadone a day is high enough to be concerned about cardiac arrythmias, these can happen any time during treatment, so I would can understand your PM doc being concerned and would discuss with him how often to get the EKGs done. Were you getting good pain relief from the 180 mg. per day of methadone? I am a bit confused about your last comment about politics being involved with treatment, are you talking about your pain treatment or something else? So far you have only discussed medical concerns not political ones. Take care, Annette""My husband and I have both had surgeries since we have been on opioids for chronic pain, neither of us had any problems with post op pain not being managed well. My husband was able to get completely off his opioids after he had his hip replaced. I just used slightly more frequent BT opiates than usual for a week or two after my surgery in addition to my long acting opioid. I just was in the hospital for a bit over 24 hours. My husband had an implanted catheter postop that delivered a local anesthetic to his operative area, it was hooked up to a PCA device, in addition to an opiate PCA device that hooked up to his IV. As soon as he was able he took his meds by mouth. His pain was well controlled also. He was home in 3 days. We both use our hot tub for pain relief, and exercise of course. There are a lot of ways to manage pain, it is worthwhile to try them all and continue with whatever helps even a little bit. Take care, Annette""Since I seem to take a very small dose of methadone compared to many people, I have not done the reading I should for high dose related coronary events. I am different than you, I would just assume that because the black box warning came out regarding high doses of methadone the clinic you went to changed its policy for patient safety issues. Doctors often change their prescribing practices when these kinds of black box warnings come out, regardless of what the drug might be. I think that is good medical practice, not politics, but you were there, so you know better than I would. How many surgeries are you looking at? Take care, Annette""Last night I had the time and energy and did a search on methadone and cardiac effects. It seems like most studies put the problem at a dose of 60 mg. per day or more. At that point they seem to see an increase in heart rhythm problems, and Q-T interval lengthening that can be problematic. This can be seen on an EKG, so they suggest a base line EKG when one starts using methadone and then yearly ones to check on it. They also said that some smaller studies showed problems that might be related to ANY dose of methadone, not just over 60 mg/day. Everyone has to read about their meds and medical problems and decide for themselves what to do, if their doctors do not want to withdraw treatment or change the dose. Thank you for the push to look into this more. Take care, Annette""My favorite site for FMS info is http://www.myalgia.com . Do some reading there and you can print out articles to take to the doctor with you to discuss further. There are several antidepressants used for FMS treatment and other chronic pain conditions also. For me, they did not work, I can<APO>t remember about three months out of my life to this day, about 15 years later. That said, the same kind of drug worked well for my husband when he had chronic pain. All you can do is keep trying different things, and by trying, you have to take most of them for at least 3-4 weeks to know if they will help you or not. Side effects often go away in that time frame, so you may ned to accept some of them, only you know if you can deal with them or not. I finally switched to antiseizure meds and opiates and zolpidem. That worked for me, but it may not work for you. I also added in by hot tub, exercise, CBT, etc. Those are things you pick up along the way, find they help and keep up with doing them. I don<APO>t believe any one should ever tell you to just live with your pain. I would only talk to the doctor about this, and instead of telling him you hurt all over, tell him what kinds of activities you would like to be able to do that you cannot do now because of the pain you have. Focus on function. Although I saw specialists to confirm my diagnosis, my care has always been in the hands of my pcps, I have had 3-4 in 25 years. I feel they have taken good care of me for the most part. Do your own research on FMS, and learn all you can, it is okay for you to know more than your doctor does about FMS, and teach him too. Take care, Annette""What exactly are transdermal injections? I am familiar with IM, IV, subQ, and intradermal, but not transdermal. What is in these injections? After two episodes with different doctors, I think I would pass on getting an injection done yet again, that just caused more pain. Take care, Annette""I looked this up and this is the method used to give medication with a gun, like for vaccinations or Restolyn, rather than with a needle. The medication is pushed through the skin with a gas stream. I did not see anything about using this instead of a needle for back problems. But I didn<APO>t look far. Take care, Annette""I would see your doctor and see what he says. If you are allergic to all over the counter pain meds, you would naturally be allergic to vicodin as that contains the same substance as Tylenol. Discuss this with your doctor, you may be able to take plain opiates as they are completely unrelated to OTC meds like tylenol and NSAIDs used for pain and fever. You may want to have allergy testing first, or at least take the first few doses with someone nearby, just to be on the safe side. Treating fevers with an ice bath is a very old and kind of outdated treatment for most fevers. An icey, cold bath will shut down the peripheral vascular system, and actually prevent the hot core blood from getting near the surface and cooling down, then recirculating inside the body to cool the rest of it down. We were taught in nursing school to use lukewarm water, lower in temp than the body<APO>s temp, but not much lower. That way you avoided closing down the skin<APO>s vascular system and also avoid shivers which may increase the body<APO>s temperature. Take care, Annette""I looked this up some time ago, and did not find any studies to show it worked. Do your search on a medical page like Medscape and/or ask the doctor you currently see what he would suggest. Also check with your insurance company and see if they pay for it. Take care, Annette""Instead of asking for more Vicodin or pain meds, I would suggest presenting him with goals that you would like to attain. Tell him exactly what you would like to be able to do that you currently cannot do because of pain. Do what he says, and if necessary keep going back and tell him how it is working. If after 2-3 tries you are getting no where with him ask him if you should try someone else and ask for a referral to a pain management doctor who handles pain with many types of treatments, not just injections and procedures. Follow the written RX exactly, if it says take one pill, take one pill. If it does not work, tell the doctor face to face, do not take 1 1/2 pills. I treat my pain meds just like I would treat high blood pressure meds, I have found if I am not paranoid about them, the doctor isn<APO>t either. Take care, Annette""A rheumatologist I saw a few years back told me not to bother with any treatment that did not bring relief after about 4 weeks. Only you know if you are getting enough relief to keep seeing the chiropractor, but it doesn<APO>t sound to me from what you said that you are. I would get a second opinion from a different neurologist or a different PM doctor, and find out just what your non-surgical treatment options are. Most surgeons only know the surgical options, and may not know what you should do if you don<APO>t want to have surgery again. There are also oral pain management therapies, so be sure to check that out also. I would not go on with a chiropractor myself after three months unless I had really significant relief. Take care, Annette""Chiropractors really, sincerely believe in what they do for the most part. I finally found one in Reno that my husband used to see that just flat out told me not to see a chiropractor for my neck as it was beyond what they could help me with. I read later that strokes were documented as a possible side effect to chiropractic adjustments of the neck, they can tear a vertebral artery that goes up into your skull. I met a nurse who actually had a stroke during her adjustment and was taken out of the chiropractor<APO>s office to the ER and the hospital. She lost the use of her whole right side, arm and leg, and it took her three years to gain them back enough to go back to work as a nurse. Do what you think is best for you, but I would not see a chiropractor myself unless an MD checked me out first and told me it was safe. Take care, Annette""What else do you do besides take methadone at this point? What dose do you use, what BT meds/doses do you use, what non-drug treatments do you use? How many doctors have suggested a pain med pump? Has anyone suggested anything else? I would see at least one neurologist, and a PM specialist, and a surgeon before deciding what to do. Always get at least two opinions before any kind of surgery. Take care, Annette""No. I have had migraines for 26 years, and no one ever suggested that to me. Take care, Annette""Does it have evidence based studies to back it up? If you have links to them I would appreciate it. Take care, Annette""Thanks anyway. Take care, Annette""You have to decide how much you trust your doctor to give you the correct drug in the correct way for your situation. The drug handbook I have for advanced practice nursing was copyrighted in 2010, so it is fairly up to date. It says this drug is not recommended for long term use in adults. It also says that the ""Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) includes this medication among its list of drug classes which have a heightened risk of causing significant patient harm when used in error."" That said, generally once a drug is approved by the FDA, doctors are pretty much free to use it however they feel is appropriate. I would make sure the pain management specialist understands FMS and how to deal with it. FMS can amplify the sensations of pain, so you may feel pain that someone without FMS might not feel as pain. Often treating the FMS will bring down the levels of pain you are feeling, perhaps without the use of narcotics. What do your PCP and the specialist who diagnosed you with FMS say about using this drug? I do not fear using any narcotic because of addiction potential, that is actually rather low in most cases, less than 1-3% depending on the study you quote. It is something I am aware of, but not in fear of. If you personally have a history of addiction, that would be somewhat different. If you have disc problems in your cervical spine (neck), I would avoid the chiropractor. I have FMS and cervical spine DDD, my pcp manages my medical issues, including pain meds. Take care, Annette""Take care of yourself. Let us know what you decide to do. Take care, Annette""Fibro is very complicated, I use http://www.myalgia.com for good solid medical info. I have been to their seminars, heard Dr. Robert Bennett, MD speak and find them honest and trustworthy. Take care, Annette""Electrically, I cannot see how having broken (fractured) leads could cause the problem you are having, but I am no expert of course. This is one of the problems that you sign on for when you get to the point of having surgically implanted devices. Things can go wrong, and you may have to have more surgery. I think there is a way online to check for recalled devices, try your search engine or call the company that made your device, and ask to speak to someone who deals with adverse events. I think they are like drug companies and have to keep track of people who call or write to them. Take care, Annette""You need to see a doctor and be examined and evaluated. No one here can tell you what is causing this. Take care, Annette""You need to be examined by the orthopedic surgeon who did your original surgery. Or a different orthopedic surgeon. Take care, Annette""Itching all over is a fairly common side effect of opioid drugs. Examine your skin for any rash and see your doctor and let him know what is going on. I had all over itching with vicodin for awhile, and it went away on its own. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t believe any one opioid is any better than any other opioid. (If anyone has links to randomized, double blind clinical trials, I would be happy to read them.)I think you just have to try different things and use whatever works for you. Most side effects from opioids do go away over time, so I would be patient and give them all time. All you can do is answer the doctors questions about your own medical history. When starting any pain management clinic, I would make sure they are the type of clinic that actually follows folks with oral medication, and other treatments, and does not do injections and procedures exclusively. Take care, Annette""Things are not hopeless, you saw one PM doctor who was not nice to you, mark him off your list and go on to the next one. Call your own pcp before he hears from this guy, explain what happened and ask him for a referral if he has one. Take care, Annette""Doctors are used to patients changing specialists from time to time, and know that we don<APO>t all get along the same way. Just be honest with your pcp, and listen to what he tells you too, as you probably have if you have been together for 15 years!!! I have been with my pcp about that long also, we know each other well enough that she understands when I pass on a particular specialist, and move on to another one, especially if the first visit doesn<APO>t go well. Chin up, all will be fine. Most of us do not like change. Take care, Annette""Thank you for all your kind words, Red Dogg. It is all the folks here that keep me coming back. Try not to worry too much, this will pass. Take care, Annette""I had no mood changes that I am aware of when I started taking this drug 13-14 year ago. I did have the hangover, and drunken feeling at first, but it went away over a few weeks at a steady dose. Take care, Annette""Pain from FMS. Gabapentin also reduced my migraines in number and severity, and helped some with irritable bowel, and irritable bladder for me. I started taking it for FMS pain mostly, and had all the wonderful effects on other problems I have. For me it has been a good drug, may not work like that for everyone though. Take care, Annette""Everyone reacts to medicines differently. Good and bad effects. That is why we need to talk to our doctors. Hope you found something else to help with your symptoms. Take care, Annette""Thanks for the heads up. Just FYI, methadone also causes QT interval prolongation, so I would definitely not take these two drugs at the same time. Be aware that other drugs also do this, and check with your pharmacist and doctor before mixing drugs. Hugs, Annette""As long as you have discussed lowering your Celexa dose with your doctor already, go for it. Let us know what happens. Take care, Annette""I would go to a neurologist and ask him what ALL your treatment options are. See a neurosurgeon for a second opinion before having any kind of elective surgery. I had a friend with low back pain who was rushed into a microdiscectomy by a new surgeon she had never seen before. After wards she had new pain down her leg that she had never had before. After the procedure she was laid up for weeks. He pretty much said he had done what he could and her new pain had nothing to do with the procedure. He refused to see her again. Everyone will respond differently to any treatment, medicinal or surgical. There are no guarantees. Any doctor who gives guarantees is being less than honest. I would personally not plan a European vacation 3 weeks after a procedure like that. I would ask for good drugs to get through the vacation, then decide when I got home, after doing a lot of research and getting a second opinion. I don<APO>t care how minimally invasive they say these surgeries are, they are still surgeries, with possible complications. Take care, Annette""I am so glad this worked out well for you. Please keep in touch, let us know how things go. Take care, Annette""You are very young to even need surgery on your back, but these are questions you need to ask your own surgeon as he would know your medical history and why he is doing this surgery for you. Please try and get all your questions answered before YOU go to have this procedure done. Write down all your questions, so you don<APO>t forget them, take a pad with you when you talk to him so you can write down the answers. You should also discuss this with your parents, as they have maybe paid attention to the surgeon in a different way than you did. Compare notes. Maybe he answered your questions already and your parents have the answers. If you really understand why he asks you to do certain things a certain way, or in a certain order, you will be more likely to follow those directions. Good luck to you. Take care, Annette""Ask the second surgeon if he thinks this surgery will cure or significantly reduce your pain? Most spinal surgery does not do well with pain, just with function. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I don<APO>t believe them based on what I have read and on personal experience with a discectomy that I had myself. We all have personal opinions, they might have had very positive outcomes, or their patients might have felt like failures themselves and not come back to them with continued pain. They may have gone on to see PM specialists or their pcps. Perhaps you could ask them for links to evidence based medical studies that show such pain free outcomes. Take care, Annette""So what does your chiropractor think about you having a microdiscectomy? I have seen a chiro for limited things after seeing a doctor, but stopped seeing them after my husband<APO>s chiro told me to. I had a herniated disc in my neck. Some chiros told me over the phone that it was no problem they could still make me pain free, others were honest and refused to even see me. I agree with you that there are good and bad in every profession. However, I would tell everyone to only see one if your MD recommends it, and never for necks. I don<APO>t think much of microdisectomies myself. A friend of mine saw a surgeon who scheduled her for one within a few days of meeting her for the first time. She was a complicated case, and had never had sciatic pain prior to surgery, but had it afterwards. He said it could not be from the surgery and refused to see her until she said she would call a lawyer. Then he saw her one time, gave her an injection for the pain and told her he would never see her again. And didn<APO>t. It took her several months to get rid of the pain he caused her. If surgeons could pick their patients properly, maybe I would feel better, but it just is not possible with the tests we have now, as far as I am concerned. Take care, Annette""I am glad the procedure went well for you, and wish you well on your trip to Italy. My mom always said to plan for the worst and hope for the best. It sounds like you got the best results. I am so happy for you. Take care, Annette""Surgeons are very strange as far as pain meds go, they get little to no training on chronic pain management. I think, probably because mine does, that your pcp should be writing your RXs, or a trained pain management doctor. I would not assume that the pain will be gone completely after the surgery. Wait and see, and hope for the best. Depression can cause pain and pain can cause depression if left untreated. I suggest you try cognitive behavioural therapy. It is a good drug free way to deal with mood disorders. You should discuss all of these things with your pcp. I have never heard of being off three months for a microdiscectomy, but if you can afford it and your surgeon writes for you to be off that long, I guess it cannot hurt. I have heard of folks going back to work within a week after a microdiscectomy. I had an open discectomy back in 1992 with an incision about 2-3 inches long and was only off for 6 weeks. I worked as an ER nurse back then. I was back to work in 6 weeks with no restrictions post op. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""I agree with your PM doctor, most surgery on backs does seem to be ineffective. It is really hard for a surgeon to pick out the person who is likely to benefit from surgery on the spine, as far as chronic pain goes. Take care, Annette""I hope you continue to do well. Everyone<APO>s outcome is different. Take care, Annette""I just wanted to thank you for your military service. I really cannot help you much medically, just be honest with your new PM doctor and the neurologist. Do your research, learn all you can and if the doctor does not seem to be on the same page as you are after three visits, I would move on. Take care, Annette""It is my understanding that breakage is one of the possible side effects of this procedure, it can happen to anyone no matter how careful they are. I am not familiar with the proper procedure for removing or replacing the old catheter with a new one. I would do proper research and find out what is usually done and why. Either ask the doctor or ask around or research it yourself. You can even call the company that makes the catheter and pump system and ask them what they recommend in these kinds of cases. Take care, Annette""I have read that different doctors use different approaches regarding break through meds. Some use them, and others prefer to increase your long acting meds until your pain is managed almost all the time. My doctor (pcp) has always let me help decide what approach to take, and I have always used BT meds in addition to the long acting one. It works for me. I have been doing this for 15 years, and remain on a fairly low dose of both types of meds compared to others here. So, from my own experience, I humbly disagree with your PM doctor. I did see a PM consultant last year, and he better explained how he came to a dose for the BT meds, and that he felt one should not be reliant on them on a regular basis, he felt that that was an indication that ones long acting medicine was not being dosed correctly. If your current mode is controlling your pain fairly well, I would stick with your current doctor, if not, I would start looking around. The other thing to remember is that meds alone should not make up your entire treatment plan. What else might you do to help decrease your pain? Take care, Annette""One should NEVER wear an arm sling unless prescribed by a doctor to prevent elbow damage. A small bit of advice that I would follow. Take care, Annette""I am sorry you are having such a hard time. Please remember that there are several different kinds of pain management doctor, see an earlier post about a person who did find the right kind for her. Only one pain management doctor has been of little use to you, try seeing a comprehensive type that uses many different kinds of treatments, including oral meds and opiates. I wish doctors understood more about the financial end of medicine but they do not. Take care, Annette""There are work out videos that are made for folks in a seated position. I would look for one of those to start out with. But, I would also talk to your doctor about doing either definitive treatment or pain management with the goal of increased function. Tell him what you want to do and what you are presently doing to show him you are doing your part. Take care, Annette""Swimming is great, like Swank says. Many motels will let you use their pool for a small monthly fee if you are not near anywhere else with a pool, like the ""Y"" or a school. I did it for awhile, but I like to be able to do something at home when I feel like it, maybe in the middle of the night, lol. Take care, Annette""The whole deal with opioids is a risk/benefit consideration. You and your doctor have to sit down and decide if the possible risks are worth the possible benefits to you. Is surgery a possible fix for your scoliosis? Do you have other problems also? I would also try neurontin, and then try pairs/trios of the meds you have already tried, for instance an antidepressant with a antiseizure med, with a muscle relaxant. They might work in tandem with another drug, when they did nothing alone. I would also add non-drug treatments, heat/cold, exercise, etc. Is addiction or alcoholism a problem in your family? If not, then I would say try all of the above first, and also try opioids and see if they work for you, and if you have any serious side effects. Opioids do not work for all people for all kinds of pain. At best they help with pain, they rarely take it all away. I hope with the little ones around you keep ALL your medicines (RX and OTC), and cleaning products locked up with a LOCK to prevent ingestion. Just a tablespoon or two of dishwasher detergent is enough to kill your baby if he/she swallowed it. Take care, Annette""Thank you for your military service. I read a recent article about the ""excessive"" use of opioids by the military, perhaps that has set these things you mention into motion. Is your doctor open to treating you with long acting opioids if the pain does come back as strong as before? Have you come straight out and asked her? Many studies do show that after a person is weaned off of long term opiates their pain IS less than it was before they started. I haven<APO>t read any studies that showed it was gone entirely though. I don<APO>t think they actually know why this happens. It does not mean you didn<APO>t have adequate pain to be treated with opiates that beginning. Talk to her and ask her just what the plan is, then decide if you want to go along with it. If not, you can always see a civilian doctor. Take care, Annette""Thanks, Swank. See I learn something new every day. Years back my friend had one of the earliest voice recognition programs, she got too frustrated with it and finally tossed it out. I guess they finally works out all the kinks. Take care, Annette""Thanks, Swank. My friend used voice recognition software for awhile, I should say she tried it. It did not work out for her, I don<APO>t think she gave it time to understand her voice well enough to work. I read back then that it usually took several weeks of regular use to work at it optimum level. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t think she really needs it, it is good for her arthritis at this point to use a key board. It was a selling point back then for a new laptop they were selling her. I will put the name away for her for later on if she needs it. Actually, I will give it to her, and she can do what she wants, when she wants, lol. I will also let her know about Ebay. Take care, Annette""Thank you for your military service also. As an old nurse, I found that the VA system differed drastically from place to place. One city, they had a great reputation, the next city, they did not. My son (Marines) and my late uncle (Navy) both really liked the care they got through the VA, although my son uses civilian doctors for some things, he still sees the VA doctors for many of his service related issues. He is fairly young so that is really most of his care at this point in time. My was very lucky in that the advocate that pointed him in the right direction for VA care was excellent when he left active duty. Take care, Annette""Thank you for your service. I hope you find the care you need. Take care, Annette""Whether I agree with you or not, and I do won`t change the reality of your situation. The folks who use the VA system are stuck, just like the folks at Kaiser are stuck. All I can suggest is to keep trying with Workers Comp, but don<APO>t get your hopes up. Wish I had something helpful to say. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know what their policy is or what they are doing, nor am I standing up for whatever they are doing to you. I only commented on some research I have read regarding folks who stopped using opioids and ended up with less pain (not zero pain) than they had to begin with. I am a bit confused because first you said your ""pain is just as worse then it was on the opioids"" but in the following paragraph you state you are still on opioids but at a lower dose??? I also have no clue what you mean by ""Dragon Naturally Speaking"", neither did my husband, ex-Army. I hope you start to feel better soon. Take care, Annette""I think the life span would depend on whether or not one smokes/uses other tobacco products, is diabetic, etc. PAD is often an indicator that other more internal arteries are also affected. It usually isn<APO>t the PAD that kills someone, but the other things, like a heart attack or a stroke. I think perhaps the two of you together should sit down with the doctor or his nurse and find out just what to do to help your husband live a long and productive life. Take care, Annette""I would ask your pharmacist what is available in your area as far as hydrocodone goes. I think it is available in 2.5 mg., 5 mg., 7.5 mg. and 10 mg. pills with acetaminophen or ibuprofen in varying doses. If you get it with the smallest amount of acetaminophen possible, it would seem like you could cut the 10 mg. ones in half and take one and a half pills at a time, but your doctor needs to decide the doses you need, and how often you may take it. Take care, Annette""I would also suggest you see an allergist and find out if you are truly allergic to tylenol, many people turn out not to be, but the only way to find out is to be tested. Take care, Annette""Ditto what Swank said. Take care, Annette""Hi, I visit here every day or every other day except around Christmas time, so please leave any info here and I will respond, especially if you put my name in the heading as you did this time. Take care, Annette""You need to let a doctor take a look at this and do proper checking to see if you have any nerve or tendon damage. Take care, Annette""We have no idea what is going on inside your hand, neither does your doctor, unless he has xray vision or did more tests since you last wrote. That is why he did not say you would be back to normal after having the surgery. No one knows. Surgery might make things better, but not the same as before. Only you can decide if surgery is worth it for you. Did you see a hand surgeon or your pcp, or an ER doctor or exactly what kind of doctor? If things are not better I would see a hand specialist, myself, then decide what to do next if anything. It takes TIME for anything to heal. Take care, Annette""I am not aware of how the process works in your state. I am currently licensed in Calif. as an RN, I re-activated my license there after I stopped working here in Oregon. In Calif. a nurses license is renewed based on continuing education, in Oregon you have to show you are working or volunteering a certain number of hours per 5 years. I doubt that I will ever be able to work again, but just in case they find a cure for what ails me, I want to be ready. I discussed the status of RNs working while taking opiates for chronic pain with my nursing board here in Oregon and they said if my employer was okay with it, so were they. The mere fact that you were on meds did not mean you were impaired. Since I did not have to do a refresher course, I don<APO>t know how that works. Is the doctor connected with the course? Is he the doctor of a patient you cared for during your refresher course? How much weight does his word carry if you have not even worked yet? I assume if your state has already given you an LPN license they must have some confidence in your ability to work. Talk to a lawyer who works in this area of the law and see where you stand. Also speak to someone in your state nursing board office. Take care, Annette""Your license was encumbered, it was only good for your clinical rotation if I read your response correctly, but I may not have, communicating by message boards is very hard. By an unencumbered license, I meant that you already had an active LPN/LVN license in hand to give to potential employers, not the one for your clinical rotation. It sounds very confusing to me. If they already had his recommendation and approved your active license, it would be wrong for them to change their minds, and crazy for him to disagree with himself by filing a complaint. I am so sorry that you are being used like this for a ""test case"". I would hope that once the case is adjudicated, the doctor would not file any more complaints, I guess you will just have to wait and see. It is very new, allowing licensed nurses to work while taking opiates. It was just not allowed at all a few years ago. I have had an active RN license for over 40 years, things change. I hope they change for the better for you. Take care, Annette""Did he write both of those opinions on paper, or say one verbally and write down the one in the complaint? It makes no sense to me at all. By the way, Suboxone contains an opioid not an opiate. I have found that specialists in addiction are not necessarily specialists in pain management. Many addiction specialists believe that everyone who uses opiates or opioids are addicts, regardless of why they take them, or by whom they are prescribed. Just my observation. Take care, and best of luck to you, Annette""I guess I am old fashioned, I like to use ""opioids<APO> for opioids and opiates for opiates. They are not interchangeable if you wish to be accurate. I know a lot of folks use them that way. WebMD is not the best reference for medical information, it is intended for lay folk. ""Opiate"" does appear in my ""Mosby Medical Encyclopedia"". If the doctor wrote down both things he said in your medical record, the licensing board should cancel them out and use whatever other information they have and approve your license. I hope it goes quickly and with as little trouble for you as possible. Maybe this is why I have kept my license up for all these years, lol. I also want to go back to work some day. Take care, Annette""If you can reactivate it by taking a infection control class, I would do it in a minute. It is far easier to keep a license active than it is to start all over again later on. I was originally licensed in Calif., then in Nevada where I worked full time as an ER nurse for about 9 years, and also in home health, I let my Calif. license lapse, then moved to Oregon where I also got a license. I have only done volunteer work as a nurse here in Oregon. In Oregon you have to work or volunteer a certain number of hours in the five year period before you re-license. When I no longer could do that, I re-licensed in Calif. There they use continuing education to re-license, 30 hours every two years. They had a system in place for RNs who had been licensed there but let it go for whatever reason. I had to do that while my Oregon license was still in effect, otherwise I would have had to take the state boards all over again. My son and his family live in Calif. All states are different as far as licensing requirements. I found the state boards very helpful, they seem to have a nurse ready to walk you through whatever you need to do. To me, it just was not worth the hassle if I had to start over with the boards. I enjoy learning so I like the continuing education classes anyway. I was not ready to give up my RN license completely when it came down to it. I guess once a nurse, always a nurse. If you have a way to reactivate, I would do it. I really wish they would just fix me so I could go back to work. Take care, Annette""Since the same doctor stated you ""did not seem impaired in the least"" it should not be difficult for you to show the LVN board the two contradictory statements by him in writing. Since he apparently does consultant work for your nursing board, why would he assume you would be a patient at his private practice? I do not see why it would go so far as to your license being revoked, you have plenty of health care professionals who feel you are not impaired, including a drug counselor who works for the doctor involved. I am sorry, I do think all nurses should have to prove they are competent while taking opiates if asked by our nursing boards, we have patients<APO> lives in our hands. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I was reading back over all the posts. Do you currently have an active, unencumbered LPN license in the state in which you wish to work? That is a basic yes/no question that would be on all your job applications. You said you had ""re-activated"" your LPN license in your original post, but then you said this doctor was asked to evaluate you by your state licensing board? If they have already reactivated your license, why would they even ask him to evaluate you? In my experience they do that before the license is re-activated. Take care, Annette""Just because you need something stronger than what you are currently on does not mean your doctor will send you to a pain management clinic. My pcp has managed my pain control for over 15 years, that is mainly what she does for me, as I am pretty healthy otherwise. I also don<APO>t understand your fear of a pain clinic, I have been to several over the years, and one offered injections, because that is what they did, I declined, the other two said my pcp was doing fine without any changes from them. It is always good to get their feedback, or let them care for you if you feel comfortable with them. Take care, Annette""I have not had these injections, but it is my understanding that the Lidocaine part of the injection is what made you numb. The steroid part would decrease any inflammation you have in that area. In turn, that would mean that if the screw on that side was pressing on the nerve causing pain, then the injection would make you numb. That is apparently how they decide if the screw is actually causing the problem, and having surgery might fix it. Because I am not your surgeon or your doctor, I would suggest you ask all these questions directly with a long conversation with your doctor. I am not sure why you consider numb worse than pain, but again you need to discuss this with your doctor. I would also get a second opinion from another neurosurgeon who is not in the same practice as your current doctor. I think second opinions are always a good thing to get before any elective surgery. Take care, Annette""Are your present meds causing unwanted side effects or not relieving your pain adequately? I don<APO>t know what you mean by a ""lower pain narcotic"". I have not seen any evidence based, double blind studies that show any one pain med is better at pain relief, or does less harm than another. If anyone out there has links to any, please post them, I would love to read them. That said, of course you can be detoxed off of your current meds and put on something else if you so choose. Talk to your prescribing doctor and explain what you want and why. Take care, Annette""Demerol is out of favor due to its metabolites causing neurotoxicity (seizures, tremors, etc.), not due to abusers of opiates. There is no way to estimate who will have a bad reaction to this drug or when. It could be with chronic use, it could be will occasional use. I suspect that with low use of the drug, manufacturers weren<APO>t making enough money to continue making it in all forms. According to my drug handbook for advanced nurse practitioners, oral meperidine should not be used for acute or chronic pain management. As I recall Mepergan is a formula that contains both oral meperidine (Demerol) and phenergan, it is no longer listed in my drug handbook. As a nurse, I agree with their point about meperidine. Have your tried all the other types of pain meds to see if any others work for you? Oxycodone is only one opiate, there are lots of other ones. A short acting pain med seems like what you need for the type of occasional pain you describe. Take care, Annette""In this case I think the problem was that the Demerol caused problems as it was metabolized inside the body more than it was about the $$. Have you tried one of the stronger opiate drugs? Take care, Annette""Go back and see your doctor again. Let him know where you stand now and what is going on. How old are you and how long have you been dancing? Maybe you need to start dancing slower and work on other parts of your body while the shins heal??? Take care, Annette""If you left a message at the UW clinic for a med refill with a doctor you had never seen, I am not surprised he put you off, it is illegal from him to give RX opiate meds, or any meds for that matter to a patient he has not yet seen. If you left the message with the prescribing doctor who wrote the original RX, he would be the one to refill it. I couldn<APO>t really tell from your post who you were asking for a refill. I am one of the fortunate folks who has not been treated like a ""drug seeker"". Sadly for everyone, they have to deal with drug seeker people all the time. Take care, Annette""How old are you? It is hard to tell because you said you have had this pain for four years, and your dad only recently ""let"" you go to the doctor. I would go back to see my doctor again, it may take several visits for him to even make a diagnosis, then you may get appropriate treatment. Take care, Annette""You can look up prolotherapy at http://quackwatch.com. Read about prolotherapy and its history there. This is an old treatment that gets drug out as new every once in a few years. Take care, Annette""It is totally wrong for your girlfriend to be discussing patients she ""knows of"" with friends. There are confidentiality laws. I don<APO>t think it is right to discuss a third person<APO>s care here either. Take care, Annette""It might make it easier for him if you were having the pain at the office, maybe make the appt. for the time of day that the pain usually happens?? You shouldn<APO>t need to feel the pain while at the doctor<APO>s office though, just tell him exactly what is going on and when it happens. Anytime you start a new medicine, I would ask the doctor how long it should be before you should feel a change. Take care, Annette""Exactly what kind of medicines did he give you? If he told you it should kick in in a few days, and it has been a few weeks, then I would go back and tell him. Write down exactly when the pain starts and stops, where it hurts, and if it wakes you up or if anything you do changes the pain. Like a different position, ice/heat, meds (what kind specifically) and how long after you take them do you notice a change in the pain. The easiest thing to do is to use a a pain scale, 0-10, 0 being no pain, and 10 being the worst pain you ever had. Do this several times a day, and when you first notice pain, and 2 hours after you do something about it, meds, position change, ice, heat, etc. Show this to the doctor and ask him what else you can try. ER doctors are not really there to make a diagnosis of chronic pain, so they aren<APO>t much help with this kind of thing. All they can do is give you something to decrease the pain for a few hours after making sure you are not having a heart attack or something else life-threatening. Take care, Annette""Glad you hear it, let me know how it goes. Take care, Annette""I would make an appt. with your pcp and sit down with him/her and have this same discussion. Have a written list of questions ready and keep a pad and pen handy to write down answers. It may also be useful to have a friend or family member go with you and let them sit quietly and take notes for you. I can feel your frustration with the whole process, but trust me you have not tried every medication known to man. What kind of specialist are you scheduled to see? What kinds of doctors referred you to see her/him? My best advice is to take a deep breath, and choose one pcp that you feel comfortable with to manage the greater picture for you health-wise. The I would not do anything or take any kinds of pills, without running it by her/him first. Take care, Annette""This is a question you need to ask her doctor. I would avoid local heat and ice until after you speak to the doctor. Since she is a diabetic her skin may be fragile. She is lucky to have you to look after her. Take care, Annette""Ones liver is just under the lower rib cage on the right hand side of the abdomen. The colon is also there. I would see a gastroenterologist (GI doctor) to check this out if her pcp has not already suggested it. Take care, Annette""At her next visit, she might ask for a blood sample to be taken to test in case the urine she gives comes back negative. If the urine comes back positive, they can toss the blood out, if not they have it ready. Take care, Annette""There are a lot of things in the neck, the esophagus, the trachea, the thyroid gland, lymph nodes, the spine, arteries and veins, lots of nerves and muscles, etc. It is a very complicated structure, go see a doctor. Take care, Annette""I had disc surgery back in 1992, and my NS did not use cervical collars for my type of surgery back then. I had asked my pcp about one and he told me in his opinion and my NS<APO>s opinion they delayed healing and prevented the muscles from strengthening. They felt the muscles got lazy and stopped doing what they should be doing. I would not base your experience on that alone. We all respond differently to surgical procedures. I have FMS now, but did not have it then. FMS changes how you respond to pain signals, both before and after surgery. The only surgery I have had since the FMS is breast reduction surgery, that actually enabled me to reduce my opiate intake. You are not alone, please do not smoke as that reduces bone healing after spinal surgery. You may have gone back to work too soon, but that is done and doctors often do not realize the financial impact of their work. Give yourself at least four more months of healing before you even worry about it, it usually takes a year to fully recover from any surgery. Take care, Annette""How many different illnesses do you have? Are any of these RXs for side effects of other RXs? Cymbalta has a maximum dose of 120 mg./day for depression, even though medical studies have shown that ""doses >60 mg./day have not been demonstrated to be more effective"". Again, for FMS, doses over 60 mg./day have not been shown to be more effective and were less well tolerated in clinical trials for FMS treatment. Side effects of Cymbalta for the central nervous system alone include somnolence (7-21%), headache (13-20%), dizziness (6-17%), insomnia (8-16%) and fatigue (2-15%). Because of these side effects listed in my nurses drug handbook I would not be surprised at all that you feel a lack of energy and have difficulty exercising and are gaining weight. The fact that you wake up hurting and hurt all day at the maximum dose of this drug would tell me it may not working for FMS. Cymbalta is also used for depression, and you are also saying you feel like you are re-entering another depression, so it does not seem to be working for that either. Please discuss this with your primary care doctor. I think it might be time to take ALL your meds in a paper bag to your primary care doctor and evaluate them all and see if you still need them, or if some might not be working at this time and could be eliminated. Another person to discuss this with, would be a good pharmacist. Our latest AARP Magazine had an article about paying a pharmacist who specializes in older folk and their illnesses/meds to evaluate our meds periodically. I already read it and recycled it this AM or I could give you more information myself. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know why you would need to go to the hospital for this?? You can see your doctor or your pharmacist as an outpatient. I also would not suggest an implanted pain pump until you have exhausted all oral meds/doses. It is another surgery, very invasive. I agree about having your liver panel done regularly if you take tylenol daily. Take care, Annette""I am an old ER nurse, we have other nurses here too, who might have insight and post responses. The main organ in the area you describe is the liver, if it was lacerated, the child could be bleeding internally. The usual thing is to do is what you describe, leaving the foreign object in place, secured with gauze and tape so it does not move. It is usually removed later in the OR, after imaging is done to reveal what it might be pressing on, etc. Removing it on the scene can cause more damage because you don<APO>t know exactly what it is doing in there. For your story, will the child die or be saved? It is amazing what good paramedics can do, and what a trauma center can do if he makes it that far. It could go either way. Take care, Annette""Any time you change meds or even from pills to patch or patch to pills, it may take awhile to find the right dose. Usually the doctor manages this depending on what your symptoms are. Tell him what you have told us and expect a few adjustments during this change. Take care, Annette""I am sorry for not answering more completely. Naloxone does not have an analgesic effect, my understanding is that it is added to the pills so that people cannot smash them up and add H2O and shoot it up IV, like heroin. The naloxone would reverse any high gotten that way. It is considered an opioid antagonist. It does not have that effect when taken orally. Buprenorphine, the analgesic in Suboxone, is listed in my drug handbook as an opioid that has a partial mu agonist and a weak kappa antagonist activity. The same drug handbook says that abruptly stopping the drug can cause a withdrawal syndrome. Everyone withdraws from opioids differently, doctors usually taper the dose down slowly. Take care, Annette""Well said! I agree with everything but the very last part. Although, I would also insist that the doctor introduce him/herself while we both have our clothing on (makes for a more level playing field) and look me in the eye before the procedure is ever done, I want my doctors to concentrate on DOING the procedure, while the ""stand-by nurse"" holds my hand and is supportive emotionally, and encouraging me. We are all different and require or like different ways of doing things. Please teach the future doctors to recognize the differences in their patients and adjust their game plan accordingly. Take care, Annette""Well said! Take care, Annette""Have a great time! Volunteer work is good for the soul. I volunteer for the local animal shelter right now, once a week I go walk dogs for an hour or two. I have done all kinds of volunteer work over the years, one of the good things about not working is having the time and energy to volunteer. Hugs, Annette""Hi, Beth Let me know what happens. I know you will find something. Hugs, Annette""Let me know how orientation goes. How very exciting for you! Hugs, Annette""The thing is, you are right, they need to be cleaned, someone has to do it. I really need to take a basic CPR class, the rules have all changed since I stopped working for $$ in 1997, the last time I took the class. YIKES!!! Probably the Red Cross can tell me where to find classes?? Just think, I used to be a CCRN, CEN, and had ACLS accreditation for 20 years in addition to my basic RN, but now I need to take a basic CPR/BLS class, oh well...we are still good, valuable folks. Have fun with Annie. Hugs, Annette""A CEN is a Certified Emergency Nurse. It is a national certification. I live in Oregon but let my license lapse here last year, but renewed the RN I had in Calif. to begin with first. Here in Oregon you have to keep working or volunteering as a nurse about 5 hours a week to keep your license. In Calif. I can do it with 30 continuing ed. hours every two years. It also costs around $100 or a bit more for a renewal, for two years at a time. My son and his family still live in Calif. I got an ADN from a community college back when you could actually do it in two years, including the summer of course. I graduated from College of Marin. I was only 19. Where did you go to school? I hope they continue to allow all types of nursing education folks to sit for their RN licenses. They were talking about only BSNs being ""real"" RNs when I started nursing and they wanted to lower anyone without a BSN to a ""technical nurse"". I have known good and bad nurses with all kinds of educations. I think if you can pass the boards, go for it. I have found that after about six months of working full time in a hospital, every one is on a pretty level playing field. To start out, I would give diploma nurses from hospitals the edge, they are just better, then ADN nurses, then BSN prepared nurses. BSN nurses just don<APO>t put in the hours at the hospital that other students do, or at least used to do up until about five years ago when I gave up volunteering as a RN. I remember years back, I started working in a hospital unit with a new BSN prepared nurse, (we were hired the same day) and she asked me to watch her give an IM injection as she had only given 5 in her training!!! She was afraid to tell the older nurses, she did fine of course, it was just her confidence level wasn<APO>t up there yet. I am so glad there are other nurses here now. We all have different training, experiences, and perspectives on things. I love talking to you knowing you are in the East. I learned just traveling around the West that there are huge geographical differences in how folks use drugs, etc. It is fun to ""talk shop"". Hugs, Annette""Boy, are you well educated!!! Be proud of your Masters from Yale!! Too bad about your accident just after being accepted to law school. However, without it we would never have met. Don<APO>t worry about others being snooty about Yale. I adore my daughter-in-law. She worked hard one or two classes at a time to finish her BA degree, while working full time, and is now working in the Master<APO>s in Social Work program at University of Southern Calif. This is the first time she has not had to work full time while going to school. She had one child while she was in high school and another five years ago. They are the loves of her life, but so is education. USC already approached her about a PhD program they have. It is a family joke to her now, but we will see, lol. My dad said ""Oh, s***"" when I got my acceptance letter to nursing school. He wanted us all to go to college, but not for his girl to take care of half-naked men. He died while I was in nursing school, so he never saw me working or anything. There is a certification program for nurses who do legal consultation work, check it out!!! I think you can do it online. Even if you never decide to work or are unable to, it might be interesting. Hugs, Annette""Thursday is coming up fast, you will feel better once that is behind you. Any orientation is a bit crazy, it makes you feel better and worse all at once. Any schooling is good schooling as far as I am concerned. Education is a good process for all of us. Whether we go to school, or just read books, whatever ones does to improve oneself is a good thing. Even if you never work for $$ using that skill set, you have the knowledge behind you. Hugs, Annette""BSN is a Bachelor<APO>s Degree in Nursing. LVNs are LPNs in many states, but I had surgery in January and almost all the hospital nurses were RNs. I think part of it depends on what part of the country you live in, and how the RN shortage has been where you are. When I worked in rural areas, there were more LVNs(LPNs). I am in a city now, different deal. Two of my great aunts also went into nursing so they could help support their family, but they graduated in 1915 and 1917 from a hospital nursing school in San Francisco, CA. They worked in an interesting time for nurses. One worked up until 1968. Take care, Annette""I have a home traction device that puts traction on my cervical spine (neck). I stayed in it for up to 30 minutes, and the relief was such that I used it 2-3 times a day, back when my neck was a problem, I keep it for if I need it now. I used it along with other treatment modalities of course. It is a soft collar attached to a bar and rope, that goes up, through a pulley attached to a device that fits over a door, then the rope goes down to a water bag that I filled according to what the doctor ordered. Easy to use, and I could watch TV or just be quiet and calm when it was in use. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t have room for an inversion table in my small apartment. Are there any that fold up to stow in a closet easily? Hugs, Annette""I would see a neurologist rather than, or in addition to, a neurosurgeon. Surgeons cut, they often do not offer less invasive treatments. I would ask what ALL your treatment options are, see what they say. I am not sure how they ruled out Bell<APO>s Palsy, I am not sure there is a test specifically for it. However, since it cleared up on its own a couple of years ago, I wouldn<APO>t worry about it. I use a hot tub which is very helpful. I have used cervical traction at home. Lidoderm Patches and other non-narcotic meds are available if you do not want to use opiates. You have to just keep trying different things until you find the combo that works for you. Take care, Annette""My pleasure. Take care, Annette""Tramadol works on the opiate receptors in the central nervous system. However, it usually does not give addicts the high they want so it was often considered a non-narcotic when it first came out. It does cause withdrawal symptoms in some folks when stopped suddenly. It didn<APO>t happen to me though. I think as they learn more about it, they might call it different things. Too my knowledge it is the only drug in its class, it is usually used first before the other stronger opiates like hydrocodone or oxycodone. I don<APO>t think things are always black and white when it comes to drugs. I would not use Wikipedia for medical info, it is not always accurate. Take care, Annette""My drug handbook for advanced practice nursing lists it as an opioid analgesic. Back when it first came out it was listed in a different nursing drug handbook I had, as an analgesic, but not specifically as an opioid. Its use is for moderate to moderately severe pain according to the same book. That has not changed in the drug handbooks from then until now. Take care, Annette""I wouldn<APO>t wait on the classification, I would take it if it works for you, and not if it doesn<APO>t work for you. A narcotic, an opiate, and an opioid are three different things, technically. The addiction potential for Tramadol is not high, so I wouldn<APO>t worry about it now, if you have taken it for two years without difficulty. Take care, Annette""I went to the search engine that WebMD provides and followed the links and it says that tramadol is an opioid. Take care, Annette""An opiate is derived directly from opium, like morphine, and opioid works like an opiate but is entirely synthetic, like methadone. That is my understanding. Take care, Annette""I am so glad to hear you are doing okay pain-wise, I hope the rest of your life is good also. My pain is under control too. Glad to see you back again. Take care, Annette""Ravenwulf, What rules exactly are the FDA coming along with? The FDA is usually part of the approval and patenting process of newer drugs, rather than enforcement or maker of rules dealing with narcotics. What number of doctors is allowed or not allowed before the labeling you mentioned? What is the ""X"" number? Take care, ANnette""I am familiar with some group medical practices that have rules about how much opiate they are allowed to prescribe in one dose for chronic pain. But usually it is not a hard and fast rule, more like a recommendation. Some of the research supports the fact that if a certain amount of opiate does not relieve the pain, then one should change opiates or try something else, something non-opiate. I think doctors also sometimes say there is a rule or a law against doing something rather than just saying they don<APO>t want to do it, I think it cuts down on the arguments. Take care, Annette""If your present pain management doctor loses his mind when you say your pain is not being relieved, but you don<APO>t want to change doctors, all I can suggest is to approach the matter differently. Tell him precisely what activities you would like to be able to do, but cannot at this time due to your pain. Ask him what he would suggest to help you get there. Deal with function rather than symptom relief. Beyond that, I can<APO>t think of anything else. You may have to either accept him as he is, or make up your mind to make a change in your providers. Yes, my doctor listens to me when it comes to telling her what my pain level is. Take care, Annette""I am here, and check in at least every couple of days, if not every day. Leave whatever info you have for me, or whatever you wish to say, with my name in the heading, and I will respond. Thanks for thinking of me. Take care, Annette""Isn<APO>t putting in a neurostimulator another surgery? How is the increase in your Opana doing? I did the same kind of increase when I was on MS Contin (generic), went from three times a day to a higher dose twice a day, it worked fine for me. I hope it works for you. What else are you doing to control the pain? Take care, Annette""Excruciating pain is never ""normal"", they should be treating it aggressively. He should never get to excruciating, he should have a medication to take that prevents that from happening. I think the abbreviation ""lap"" was confusing, it may have been mistaken for laparoscopy when you meant laparotomy. The first means a scope was used in very small incisions, the second means he had a larger incision and they did not use a scope, just peered inside and worked directly. I hope your husband feels better soon. Take care, Annette""Just tell the doctor what you told us, let him know that you are willing to try whatever he suggests, then leave it to him to advise you. There are other steps to try besides opiates, but if you need them, you need them. Meantime, keep your diabetes under good control. Take care, Annette""Take a friend or family member with you to write down notes regarding what the doctor tells you to do. Have written questions with you to ask him. Don<APO>t forget to ask how long you should wait before expecting improvement from any medication or treatment. If you want a walker you can usually get one at a thrift store, lots of people use them for a short time after surgery, then donate them. I got all that kind of stuff for my husband when he had his hip replaced. I got all of it at thrift stores. Then donated it back when he no longer needed it. Take care, Annette""Best of luck with the doctor appointment. I am glad you are inviting your sister to go along with you. Take care, Annette""What kind of reaction did you have to the Cymbalta? How do you know what medicine caused the reaction if you started all three at once? It takes time, several weeks, for Cymbalta to work at its optimum level, some side effects go away on their own over a few weeks, same as other drugs. Lots of doctors will get upset if a new patient asks for refills of only the opioids and not the other meds she is on, it is kind of a red flag for them. Methadone is very tricky to prescribe correctly, it is VERY important that you never take any ""extra"" doses or increase the dose unless the doctor tells you to. That is how people DIE. It gradually builds up in your system over time, it does last a fairly long time once it does. I take mine three times a day, with oxycodone for BT pain. I use gabapentin and zolpidem also. If you cannot take SSRIs the anti-seizure meds are good to try. Perhaps you will tolerate them better, I did. I would stick with that doctor and see how it goes over time. I give all doctors at least three visits, things always have worked out for me. Take care, Annette""So, do you have enough to last the ten days until your next appt? Take care, Annette""I assumed she/he had more pain because he was doing more, like mowing the grass. Regardless, I agree that seeing another doctor if that one does not believe you may be the best choice. Take care, Annette""I am glad that things went well for you. Expect some pain, that is normal after any surgery, you already know that, but remind yourself, lol. It would be hard to give yourself shots without being able to bend your head over to look, the nurse can also just keep an eye on you. Take care, Annette""I hope you continue to do well, and recover uneventfully. Take care, Annette""Hi, Beth Unfortunately, no. I have seen patients with hardware literally holding their spine together through an entire segment. Doing nearly the entire cervical spine at one time is scary, but not really unheard off. Hugs, Annette""Hi, Beth Not to try and cause any trouble on this, but the cervical spine only has 8 vertebrae, the thoracic has 12, the lumbar 5, and then the sacrum. I double checked this in my Merck Manual, Chapter 165 - ""the neurologic approach to the patient."" Page 1348 has a diagram. Hugs, Annette""I do not know how or why your spine healed, or not, the way it did. I had only a discectomy done, no hardware or bone graft done, with an anterior approach in 1992, my spine completely fused on its own in five months. I was back to work in two months as a full time RN. My only restriction was not lifting anything above my shoulders. Clearly your problems are different than mine. I hope you do well. Take care, Annette""Well, it was a success in that I had full function of my hands afterward. That is what I wanted. But, six months later I herniated the next disc and did not have surgery, let it heal on its own. 12 months later, it was about the same as the first one. My main problem is I get numbness in my hands and arms if I flex my neck for more than 5-10 minutes. I don<APO>t know what causes my upper body pain, FMS or the disc disease. I think from all my research on the subject that the best thing you can do is find a solid doctor that you trust with your life. Sometimes surgery is necessary, sometimes it is not. It is a difficult call to make, a good doctor is paramount. Take care, Annette""I knew you already knew your spinal stuff and just wrote the wrong numbers, I just wanted to make sure any other readers got the right numbers. Sorry about the headaches and lack of sleep. That always makes my pain worse, never mind my cognition. I saw your other posts and corrections to them after this one, or I would not have said anything. I will keep my fingers crossed and hold good thoughts for you on Dec. 8. Take care, Annette""Just for future reference C stands for cervical, T stands for thoracic (Thorax = chest), L stands for lumbar, S stands for sacral, and lastly there is the coccyx or tailbone. By using specific language rather than neck, back, lower back, or tail bone area, everyone else is more likely to know what you are talking about. The entire thing is the spine. Just a suggestion. Take care, Annette""It is too bad that Charles made some wrong assumptions about your surgery. I am sorry that he did. He swears by his type of fusion, I like mine even more, no hip incision/needle removal of cells was involved. The doctor just took out the bad disc and let the ones above and below fuse together on their own. Five or six months later he did an xray that showed the two vertebrae had fused together. One small incision, no cervical collar at all! We all have our own favorite meds/treatments/surgeries that worked for us, that may or may not work for others depending on their circumstances. Hopefully, our doctors have all the information they need to make a treatment plan, we can sign on or not, as we prefer. I hope everyone gets at least one second opinion before non-emergent surgery. I hope you continue to do well, and are as pain free as is possible for you. Take care, Annette""10 days out and using less medicine for pain?? Good for you! I don<APO>t think using Norco twice a day is a bad thing, all things considered. Surgery does not always relieve all the pain, so just move forward, do whatever the doctor tells you to do, and see where the path leads you. Everyone is different, surgeries are different for different people. I hope you continue to heal and that things get better every day. Take care, Annette""It sounds like you are doing well, all things considered. If your bone has not fused in 2 1/2 years since your original surgery, I am curious why they didn<APO>t use the bone growth stimulator already on that part of your spine? I am glad he is using it now. Do not use any tobacco products, I am sure you already know that though. Tobacco really keeps bone from growing and fusing into itself or metal parts. I suspect that what Charles meant by a ""failed fusion"" was what you are describing as ""still doesn<APO>t show any sign of bone growth"". A failed fusion is when the fusion itself does not happen, for whatever reason. He is absolutely right in saying not to let your pain get out of control. It is far easier to keep the levels lower, than to get them back there after they get too high. It sounds like you are doing great. Take care, Annette""I totally agree with you. Comprehensive treatment clinics are the way to go. I think one should try everything, I feel if you get a small amount of relief from each of several treatments (drugs included) the total amount could be a wonderful thing. I am glad you found the right clinic for you. Take care, Annette""I honestly do not know the answer to your question. Tears do heal on their own sometimes, so perhaps the tear that showed up a year before just healed up. Casts are used for things besides fractures, they also immobilize the foot/ankle to allow healing of soft tissues. I would perhaps get a second opinion from another foot specialist, rather than ask your pain management doctor about it. A walking cast is fine to walk on with a cane, you don<APO>t necessarily need crutches. Numbness from nerve pressure usually does go away after awhile, I think a year is in the right general length of time for it to heal. Take care, Annette""I think it was called Netiquette, it was just a good reminder. Hugs, Annette""What do you hate about it? I would discuss this with your doctor. Take care, Annette""Tramadol is specifically for pain and works on the opioid receptors of your central nervous system, like the opiates do. Celexa is an antidepressant and also may be useful for pain, as it helps your body retain serotonin, a neurotransmitter that mediates both mood and pain signals, so it may work for both pain and depression. Or it may not. Antidepressants do not work to help control my chronic pain, but they do work for some other people. My personal opinion is if the tramadol works, why change it? But if it doesn<APO>t work at all, why not try something else? Take care, Annette""Tramadol and Celexa are two completely different types of drugs. Tramadol works like the opiate do, it binds with the opiate receptors in your central nervous system. It makes you not really care about pain, it does not stop the pain itself. Although the antidepressant, Celexa, may help your depression also, he may be prescribing it primarily for pain management. The antidepressants mediate the neurotransmitters that send pain messages to your brain. These neurotransmitters also carry the messages for moods, like depression. They just happen to help with both, depending on the dosage. Like Dave said, give it a try, like you would any other medical treatment. If you were taking meds for high blood pressure, would it matter? Don<APO>t tell your friends or co-workers if you are worried about the stigma, but when it comes down to it who cares what they think anyway? I do feel it is smart of you to question why first, but when it comes down to it, only you know what is right for you. Take care, Annette""I am a retired RN who worked mostly in hospitals also. Lab folk are wonderful resources in my opinion. Things are always evolving. Take care, Annette""Your doctor has made it very clear what he is willing to do. Some doctors do not believe in breakthrough meds at all, they always want to increase the long acting meds instead. I think you are stuck with his way of doing things until you find another doctor willing to accept you as a patient. Telling his nurse that you used an illegal drug may have led to not getting breakthrough meds, but he may have decided to do that anyway. This is one of the problems with using a medication pump, you are at the mercy of whatever doctors use them, and are willing to accept you as a patient. Take care, Annette""If it is warmer to the touch than other areas nearby and it hurts, I am sorry but you need to see the doctor and let him decide if you have an infection and what to do about it. Take care, Annette""I was a RN in the 1970s and there were disposable syringes back then. I have never used the old fashioned kind. My great aunt did, she was also an RN from 1916 until the late 1960s, she was the person who sharpened the reusable needles and wrapped the glass/metal syringes for sterilizing. It was not an ""incubator"", but an autoclave that heated and ""sterilized"" instruments and syringes back in those days. Who knows when the military started using more modern equipment. They had what they had, medicine is an evolving field, they learn more every day. They didn<APO>t even know Hep C existed back in 1970, or HIV/AIDS. A temporary pump is used with an intrathecal line into the intrathecal area of the spine, not an IV. An IV is an intravenous line that goes into your vein. Just minor adjustments, but important to be as accurate as possible. Take care, Annette""What kind of lab work did you do? When I was in nursing school in 1968-1970 there was hep A and hep B, shortly after that there was the non-A and B that you mentioned. Now there is hep A, B, C, D, E, G, and non- ""all of the above"" hepatitis, I suspect with research they will find even more. What happened with hep F? Do you know? Take care, Annette""Rockieo17, you may already know all this. I don<APO>t know you, so I don<APO>t know. But, there are a fair number of newer members here, so here is a bit of info about terminology. I use addiction, dependence and tolerance as they are used in medical settings. Outside of the medical setting, some people use them interchangably, and they should not be used that way. ALL opioids can be addictive, particularly for people who have addictive personalities or a family history of addiction. Even so, addiction only happens to about 5% of people who use opioids for pain, a very low percentage for a side effect. We all need to be very aware of why we are taking our pain meds, and not ever take them for anything but what they are prescribed for, physical pain. The dilaudid you take is just as addictive as any other opioid. Addiction has to do with WHY you take a drug, not the drug<APO>s chemical make up or the dose you take. Addiction is defined as the use of a substance for other than the reason it was prescribed, and in spite of the negative consequences on ones life. For opioids that usually means taking them to get high or to relieve stress rather than to relieve physical pain. Negative consequences might include disruption of work or family relationships, arrest, being discharged by doctors, DUIs, etc. Just because one goes through withdrawal, does not mean one is a drug addict, it just means they were dependent on the drug. Many different classes of drugs cause dependence. When your blood level goes down a certain amount, your body reacts because it has become used to having the drug in it., and you have withdrawal symptoms. Many kinds of drugs require you taper off slowly when you are no longer going to take them. The Dilaudid dose you are using is large, most people start out at 2-4 mg. Since you have been on opioids for awhile you already have a tolerance, so you take a higher dose. Nothing wrong with that, but if you ever decide to get off, you need to taper off slowly if you want to avoid withdrawal symptoms. The dose of pain meds a person takes is based on the amount of relief they get, it will gradually go up over time for many people due to tolerance. Tolerance means that as you take a drug over time, you will gradually need more of the drug to get the same effect. It is an expected side effect of opioids, and also some other classes of drugs. If you develop tolerance more quickly than someone else, or have just been on the drug for a longer time, you will end up taking a higher dose than they will. The amount of withdrawal symptoms you end up with when you taper off of an opioid depends mostly on the taper schedule you use. The slower the taper, the fewer symptoms you will have. It is entirely possible to end up having no withdrawal symptoms at all. My best friend tapered off of methadone after being on it for a couple of years and had no withdrawal at all. He had surgery that corrected the cause of his pain, so he no longer needed the methadone. Everyone responds to meds differently and different doctors have personal preferences as far as what drugs they prescribe most often. The best thing is for everyone to find the drug that works best for them. I always believe in starting the dose low and increasing it very slowly with these kinds of meds. That way you can take the lowest dose possible for your relief, and end up with the fewest side effects. I am glad you are doing well with your current meds. Take care, Annette""You are absolutely right, addiction is psychological and dependence is physical. The problem is in the old days when I went to school, they used different terms than they do now, so many people have the wrong idea about addiction. The latest research quoted in my nursing journal is a 5% risk of addiction with opioid use for pain. They included everyone in the studies they used, they did not exclude former addicts or people with family histories of addiction for treatment, they can have pain that requires treatment also. Before that article the research showed a less than 1% risk of addiction. Either way, I think it is a low risk and should be able to be managed with proper medical care. Hope you are well. Take care, Annette""This is an urban myth. It is simply not true. You can go to the FDA website and read exactly what it says. The drug must be exactly the same drug in the same amount, and the onset of action must be the same as the brand named drug. The number of mg. on the label IS the number of mg. of the active drug in the pill, not the total of the inactive and active ingredients. Shame on your professor if he told you such a thing, and if you are a practicing pharmacist, you should go read the information for yourself. I am an RN and I did. I read all these rumors about generics and brand named drugs, and I did the research to make certain I knew from the horse<APO>s mouth what was what. Take care, Annette""Avinza is a long acting form of morphine in a brand name. It was first recommended to be dosed once a day. But, now it seems like most people who use it end up taking it twice a day. I use a generic of long acting morphine and I take it twice a day. It is much cheaper than Avinza. I have been using it for nearly ten years and have had no trouble with it except the expected side effect of constipation. I treat that symptomatically. Take care, Annette""If you want to quote the FDA as permitting the generic companies to use less than the number of mgs. they state on the label, then get that information from the FDA not anywhere else. I have spoken to many pharmacists over my 39 years of practice, including a close friend who has a PhD in pharmacy and has his own pharmacy, and hospital pharmacists, and other retail pharmacists, they all told me that the generics must have exactly the number of mg. that it says on the label, no more no less than the brand name drug does. I have also worked on my state<APO>s Health Resource Commission<APO>s drug class evaluation subcommittees with doctors and pharmacists, again they all say the same thing, no difference in amount or drug when comparing the generic and brand name drugs. I also know someone who works for a drug company, and she says they are regularly tested by quality control to make sure the drugs are being manufactured in accurate doses. This is one reason drug companies have recalls occasionally. if one pill is not accurate as to ingredients and quantity, they pull that whole lot. I am not putting you in your place, just telling people to go to the FDA website for information about this if they want correct and accurate information. Regardless of whether or not you agree with the political side of the FDA (I don<APO>t either), at least quote them accurately. After I kept reading on-line about people saying the FDA says this and the FDA says that about generics, I went myself and read it. Anyone with a high school education can do that. You don<APO>t have to be a nurse or a pharmacy student. If you knew anything about nursing, you would know that educating patients is one of the main responsibilities of nurses, and we do have to give out correct information about the meds they are to take, whether we are administering them, or they will be taking them on their own. The doctors do this, then the nurses do it again. Pharmacists do not come to the ER or to the floors when patients are discharged and give out drug instructions, they give out instructions when someone fills a new RX at the pharmacy. It is good for patients to hear the instructions several times, as they rarely remember if they are only told once. Good luck in your career. Take care, Annette""I totally agree with you. My pharmacist has always been a member of my health care team. Over the years, I have had really good ones, and mediocre ones, just like with any other human being. Professionally, I have always referred patients to their pharmacists if they needed more information. No pharmacist I have ever met said that generic meds could have less mg. per pill of the active ingredient than the brand name pills do. The generic companies could not get FDA approval if they had 80-110% of the amount they wrote on the label. Take care, Annette""Here is the website, www.fda.gov/cder/ogd/#Introduction. Anyone who is truly interested can go there and read about the generic approval process and all about the generic drugs in general. The word ""identical"" comes up often in relationship to drug, dose, route of administration, etc. when comparing generics to trade or brand name drugs. Identical does not mean 80-110% of the drug is allowed in generics. It means precisely 100%. Milligrams are metric weights, they are not adjustable, they are specific amounts. If anyone can give me the place in the FDA site where they say 80-110% of the dose is permissible so I can go read it myself, I would truly appreciate it. If I am wrong, I am happy to learn something new and apologize for any inaccurate info I have posted. I have done so in the past. No one is perfect, we all make mistakes. Point me in the right direction. I have asked for this same thing numerous other times on this board when this topic has come up, no one has ever posted back with this information verified anywhere on the FDA site. Take care, Annette""Is this from opiates? NSAIDS? Tylenol? What kind of pain medication? Who (what kind of MD specialty) told you that your enlarged bile duct was from this? I have never heard of this before, but I am interested to learn more. Take care, Annette""Hope it shows nothing of importance. I think it is a good idea to get one as a baseline so you know where you stand. Let me know what happens. Take care, Annette""I have never heard that either, did you happen to ask him what kind of chronic drug use he was talking about? I will try looking it up. Take care, Annette""I agree that doctors often cause more stress than necessary. It sounds like he is just covering his butt. If your bile duct is actually smaller now than before, I would not be so worried and just go from now forward. I did a bit of reading about this topic, and found one study of methadone patients who had liver problems already. There were a couple of other studies that I did not thoroughly read. They seemed to hone in on methadone maintenance patients, who had been opiate addicts prior to taking methadone. It seemed pretty preliminary as far as medical studies go, I think it is worth considering, but more as a step for further study. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t remember specifically what I used, but in general I use Google, or Medscape for medical research. I filter down the Google stuff to just true medical research. I don<APO>t use WebMD anymore for research questions. Take care, Annette""Take care and good luck in the future. I found a lot of info, but did not have the time/energy to filter through all of it. I use a very low dose of methadone for pain management, only about 20 mg. a day, because it is very cheap, so I am interested in following this up, if/when I find anything, I will post it. Annette""Ask your doctor, only he can say why he would opt to do anything. That said, why worry about it at this point? Try the regimen he is suggesting and see what happens. You can either stick it out with him, or switch to a new doctor and not really know what will happen then either. Your choice... You are taking a lot of oxycodone and Oxycontin. You don<APO>t mention your age, or how long it took you to go from 0 to the current amount of opiates you are taking, perhaps he is concerned about how quickly he had to increase your dose, I don<APO>t know, only he knows. Ask him. Take care, Annette""I agree with a lot of what you say, however, withdrawal symptoms vary from person to person. My husband had NO withdrawal symptoms either of two different times he went off of methadone for pain since I have known him, 20 years. He told me that before I knew him he also stopped taking both morphine and percocet that he used for chronic pain during his bout with lymphoma. I cut my own use of methadone for pain in half after having surgery that reduced my pain levels, and I also had no withdrawal symptoms. If one is tapered off very slowly, most, if not all withdrawal symptoms can be easily managed. Take care, Annette""Complex Regional Pain Syndrome. It is the new name for RSD, Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy. Take care, Annette""I am with you, I like the cooler weather the best! Hugs, Annette""I would go see a neurologist (not a neurosurgeon) and ask him what all your treatment options are. Surgeons do surgery, and usually offer treatment that they can do, unless you have some other medical condition that makes it too high a risk. Take care, Annette""I would go see a neurologist (not a neurosurgeon) and ask him what all your treatment options are. Surgeons do surgery, and usually offer treatment that they can do, unless you have some other medical condition that makes it too high a risk. Take care, Annette""These are questions I have always asked my doctors no matter what their specialty. My problem is that pcps and ER docs often refer from a list provided by their clinic or employers, or the hospital call list for an ER, they may not even know the second doctor at all. I always ask my doctor if she actually knows the doctor she is referring me to. Doing that can eliminate doctors who do not even have similar ways of going about things as I do. I have been seeing my pcp for about 15 years now, she knows me pretty well. Take care, Annette""I also refused trigger point injections offered by an anesthesiologist who was in a pain management group. I later asked for SSDI benefits based on my pain conditions, FMS, DDD, and migraines. No one from SSDI said a word about me refusing this treatment option. I think SSDI just wants everyone to go to work regardless of their medical conditions, and will do whatever they feel is necessary to get to that point. Something like 75-85% of the folks who are rejected at the first level go on and receive their SSDI at an upper level of consideration at SSA, if they do go on. I think that SSA just wants to winnow out people who think it is an easy way to collect $$ for life, and do not really have medical conditions that qualify them. I just read on line that Calif. recently passed legislation stating one with chronic intractable pain does NOT have to go through with any invasive treatment if they do not wish to, they can opt to be treated with medications like opioids or other non-surgical treatments, and doctors must tell patients that there are doctors who use those methods if they choose not to provide them themselves. I also was eventually approved at the hearing level to receive SSDI benefits, I also had a lawyer. I am glad to hear that you were approved also. I had an episode of rather severe depression when I was finally approved, it passed with the use of CBT techniques. Did you also go through this? I have read that it is not that uncommon when the govt. decides you are disabled to have that kind of response, it is like if they said you were not disabled you would be able to go back to work. Even if we know it is not true, it kind of takes the wind out of us when they agree with us. Take care, Annette""It is always good to know that others had similar experiences. You are right about what CBT is, I tried SSRIs and other types of antidepressants, and they made my depression worse, not better, so I stopped taking them and used a good therapist and the book she suggested when I moved away, ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns, MD. This was a life changing book for me. Another good book is ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"", by Dr. Margaret Caudill, MD, PhD. Whether you are burned out or not, going from being a nurse, to being disabled is a tough transition to make. Be kind to yourself. Take care, Annette""I have been an RN for over 40 years. I no longer work due to my chronic pain conditions however. I volunteered at a free clinic for nine years or so, twice a week as a nurse, now I just volunteer weekly at the animal shelter in my area. But, I keep my RN license current in Calif. by keeping up with my continuing education. Who knows, I might go back to work someday. I guess once a nurse, always a nurse, lol. The books are great, I hope you enjoy them. Sometimes you can pick them up at the thrift stores, but you can always order them online or at a book store. As I recall they were about $20 apiece new when I bought them. Take care, Annette""If the epidural and PT help, by all means repeat them, but if they have not helped yet, I would not be one to keep doing them, I would just sit tight and say no, been there, done that, what other treatment options do I have? PT may be something you have to do for life, most exercise is, but you should find some type of treatment that you can do on your own at home. I would not say the same thing regarding epidural injections. If the surgeon cannot do anything, then I would find a pain management doctor who uses many modalities including oral meds for pain management, and stick to the one doctor. Take care, Annette""Charles has the stats, but I believe that most literature does not really support surgery for discs that are bulging but not herniated, or for treatment of pain alone due to bulging discs. The odds of pain relief from surgery are not worth the risks as far as I have read. There are other kinds of medicine, heat, exercise, etc. Try asking about non-drug treatment modalities and see what is available in your area for your condition. Take care, Annette""You can just say ""no"". Ask what other kinds of treatment are available for you to try. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know why there are more patients with chronic pain, perhaps doctors just diagnose it more, so it is official now. I think many people had chronic pain and just did not say anything before. Now they ask you at doctors<APO> offices if you are in pain and what you would score it. That starts a conversation. I choose not to use the word ""suffer"", I have chronic pain, but I choose not to ""suffer"". There was a quote some time ago on this board that said something along the lines of we may have chronic pain, but we choose whether to suffer or not. I choose not to. Take care, Annette""People in the 1700s and 1800s died long before they would even be considered old nowadays, so even though they might have had chronic pain, they did not live into their 80s and 90s like they do now. I am so sorry that you and your family have had so much trouble with the medical profession. I have pretty much the opposite story, I am one of five siblings, etc., etc. But we have had reasonably good medical care. My doctors seemed to generally know what was wrong with me and gave me the right medicine the first time for the basic stuff. I only took multiple meds in cases where that was kind of to be expected like migraines, and FMS where there is no one size fits all medicine. I think the best thing is for all of us to speak up and tell our stories so that bad things do not happen to other people. Take care, Annette""I would suggest you also see a pain management specialist, to treat the pain you do have properly. I would not suggest steroids in another country just because professional athletes use them. They also can cause severe problems when used long term. Take care, Annette""Sorry, sometimes there is no definitive answer as to what is causing pain and how to fix it. It is often hit or miss, or try one thing then another until you find what works for you. Take care, Annette""I have FMS, my favorite medical site for good information is http://www.myalgia.com. Print out anything you think might be helpful and take it to your pcp doctor to discuss. A rheumatologist who sees a lot of FMS patients regularly would also be helpful in making this diagnosis. There are a lot of diseases with similar symptoms that must be ruled out first, usually with blood tests. If they are all negative, FMS is the next step. It is diagnosed with a good medical history, and examination, usually including the tender point examination. Take care, Annette""The label on our generic version says to take one cap full mixed in water or juice, once a day per directions. Please consult your doctor if you take it more often, or if you are taking any prescription drugs. All doctors have preferred bowel care plans, especially for patients on opiates or who have specific problems. Take care, Annette""Miralax is the same as the stuff that you are taking. Thanks for the positive feedback. Take care, Annette""I would also make an appt. with a neurologist, rather than a surgeon. He can tell you what other treatment options you have that are not surgical in nature. Not all surgeons keep up with those things. I have had cervical surgery for a functional deficit, but I would not have it for pain relief. It is too iffy, and I had a blood clot after surgery, one of the possible adverse effects. I don<APO>t want to do that again. I don<APO>t think hand/finger swelling is caused by neck problems in the discs, but do your research and find out for sure. Take care, Annette""A CT scan is normally done as part of a headache workup, it is almost always negative for tumors. The doctors have to be certain of course, but no one realizes how scary the work tumor is to a lay person. Hives are usually an allergic response due to excessive histamine release. Are you sure they are hives? She could be having a rash due to something else, has she seen a dermatologist? Has she tried an antihistamine medication to see if that would help the rash? Take care, Annette""I would not take a bunch of any kind of pills. I might try going to a neurology clinic at a teaching hospital and be evaluated there? I did that for migraines that would not go away. I flew from Reno down to UC-SF Medical Center. I found it very helpful. The doctor was great, he took his time and read all my appropriate records. Then he did a thorough examination and gave me his suggestions, followed by a written report to my doctor back home. Take Care, Annette""Benzos and opiates and anesthetics are all completely different drugs. What kind of pain are you having now, when was your brain surgery, and how old are you now? If pain meds are your main problem now, I would just keep telling your doctor what you pain levels are, and what functional things you would like to do that you cannot do now due to the pain. Also tell the truth, how can a doctor be blamed for not knowing what is going on with you if you are lying to him. Take care, Annette""Yes, baclofen is the generic name. It is an older drug. I like it, talk to your doctor about it. We all respond differently to meds, so you never know what might help, or hurt. Take care, Annette""Soma is carisoprodol, a skeletal muscle relaxant. It is not a sulfa drug, and my reference book does not list any cross sensitivities between Soma and sulfa drugs. it is a central nervous system depressant, so you have to be careful mixing it with other depressants. Personally, I don<APO>t really like Soma. Of course it depends on the individual, but an awful lot of people who use it for longer than a week or two become tolerant and have to keep upping the dose for it to work. Lots of people also end up abusing it. Many doctors consider it a red flag if a patient comes in and asks for an opiate and Soma. Lots of drug abusers really like that combination. My drug book suggests 350 mg. three to four times a day as the maximum for muscle spasm. Not recommended for the elderly at all. I hope you find the best combo for you. Take care, Annette""30+ years ago we called it ""polypharmacy"" when people just took whatever pills they could find, and didn<APO>t necessarily know what they were taking. It is a very dangerous kind of party to go to. When my 31 year old son was in elementary school one of the kids in his class was busted for selling pills at school that he told the boys were steroids to bulk up their muscles with. Turned out they were daddy<APO>s high blood pressure pills. This is one reason I am so adamant about keeping pills of all kinds locked in a lock box. My drug books all have all drugs listed in alphabetical order by generic name, but if you look up the brand name it will refer you to the generic page for that drug. Many drugs are just so well known by their brand name that people don<APO>t think of looking up the generic (chemical) name. Or the brand name is just shorter and easier to remember, like tylenol or soma. I live in Oregon and we have had a lot of press lately about drug deaths from opioids. One pain clinic was closed, their RX drugs were being diverted to the street and a teen died from an overdose at a party like the one you mentioned. They had been under investigation for a number of years, and it sounds like they needed to be stopped. They had actually told their clients to fill all their RX opiates at a single out of state pharmacy. Their doses were so high that many of the local pharmacies would not fill them. They had no doctors at all on staff, just nurse practitioners. From the letters after their names, I don<APO>t think any were PhDs or had speciality training in pain management. Two of the nurses got busted so far and relinquished their DEA privileges. The clinic is still doing primary care, just not pain management. All their pain management patients are scrambling to find other providers who will take them. It is a terrible situation for real pain management patients. Many of the methadone deaths here and elsewhere are from people who weren<APO>t thoroughly educated about how it works and took extra when the first pill didn<APO>t work. With its long half life it builds up in the system and can be deadly, especially during the first few weeks of use when you are working the dose up to the right one for that patient. I feel strongly about only getting it from doctors who are really well trained and have lots of experience prescribing it. I am like you, I only take what my doctor has prescribed, I am very careful about going in to see her if I need better management rather than just taking ""extra"" pills. I want to keep a good relationship with her, I think she is a great doctor for me. Trust goes both ways. I hope you feel better soon. Take care, Annette""I use baclofen when I have painful flares. It seems to make my pain meds work better. Then I stop taking it once the flare is over. Everyone reacts differently to meds. You pretty much just have to keep trying different ones until you find the one that works for you. Baclofen is also a muscle relaxant. When I first started taking it, it did make me sleepy, but once I got used to it, it did not. It took about a month. That happens with the sedative side effects of many meds, they often go away with use. Always glad to be of help. Take care, Annette""Have you been to an MD who specializes in eye problems? It would seem that if you have had it three times this year, and your pcp cannot figure it out, it is time to see a specialist. Take care, Annette""I would try the eye drops before I went back, myself. Otherwise, he will just ask what happened when you used them, and when you tell him you didn<APO>t try it, he may just tell you to go home and do it... I am not sure why you would go to the doctor and then not try what he offers? I am sure you have your own reasons, if you don<APO>t feel comfortable with this doctor, how about getting a second opinion from a different eye doctor? Often times with medical diagnoses it takes trying a few different things and seeing what happens to actually make a firm diagnosis. Take care, Annette""He also needs to possibly get on a different opiate for long term use. All the acetaminophen in the vicoden that he gets from the doctor and from the street may end up killing or damaging his liver. He should also make certain he does not take any over the counter meds with acetaminophen in them or drink any alcohol at all while taking these meds. I cannot even imagine both of you living on his disability money and paying for street drugs too. Take care, Annette""I would try what she suggests and take a plain tylenol (generic) along with the oxy and see what happens. I am a believer in generic drugs, they have always worked fine for me. I personally use generic oxycodone for breakthrough pain along with methadone for my long acting med. If you don<APO>t speak up when you see the nurse practitioner and be very specific about what you feel the new meds are doing for you, she will probably assume everything is okay. It is not insulting to anyone to say that your pain is not being relieved adequately, but you do have to say so. I would just speak up and tell her that you cannot do x,y, and z now due to pain and you would like to be able to do these things. This changes the focus to function, rather than something as amorphous as pain. I don<APO>t know why you feel this would insult anyone? Take care, Annete""I am a nurse also, and getting SSDI was a real shock to my system. Sure, I knew I would get it eventually, but when the government actually said I was totally disabled, it hit me hard. I was very depressed for some months, maybe a year, then I started turning the corner. I have been doing various kinds of official volunteer work since then and that and CBT really helped me. Even doing a small thing, like letting a mother go ahead of me at the check-out counter at the grocery store at ""that"" time of day, between work and dinner, makes me feel better. We can all do little things for others, some of us are lucky enough to be able to do more. Take care, Annette""Yes, I read about the COLA increase of 3.6% also, now we just have to hear what Medicare will cost as far as increases go, then we can figure out what it means to each of us. The article I read said that will come out next week. Not having any increase in SSDI for two years was tough. I understand how they figure it out, but it does not surprise me that they use a different formula entirely for other cost of living increases in our government. I am a little confused about the original poster who said SSDI is a bit less every year, and we had not had any COLA increases in over five years. I assumed she meant what SSDI will buy each year. But as far as the COLA increases, I am totally confused about what she is talking about, I got increases every year up until two years ago. Take care, Annette""Thanks, I haven<APO>t read today<APO>s paper yet, or seen the news on TV. That will give me something to figure out. Hope you have a great day too. Take care, Annette""It was in the newspaper this AM, Medicare Part B will increase by about $3.50 per month for most people. That is far better than what they expected, and works out well for me. Take care, Annette""I would also have at least one specialist that gives his supporting view of your case in addition to your pcp. My pcp wrote a page and a half narrative of my symptoms, tests, and diagnoses. Then he added what kind of treatments we had tried and the outcome of those. I have found that SSA does not want a doctor to just say you are disabled, they want to know how long you can sit, stand, walk, etc. How much you can lift and carry and how often. How often and what length you need rest periods during the day. They really want the nuts and bolts of your day. I also had three or four old friends who knew me before and after my illness write letters explaining how I was different, and what was changed about me. These were notarized of course. These are just my opinions, having dealt with this system myself. Take care, Annette""She sounds depressed to me, and should see her pcp and possibly get a referral to a therapist. Preferably one who is used to dealing with chronic illness. I believe it is usually best to find one pcp and stick with them for the long haul rather than skipping around to different doctors. Find someone who fits with their way of doing things. Take care, Annette""Or thirdly, the pain in your feet is NOT related to the Grave`s Disease OR a drug reaction at all, but is something completely unrelated. Maybe you need to bring this up at a visit to your primary care person. Take care, Annette""See a vet about horses and maybe a different foot doctor for yourself. Horses do not walk on the balls of their feet, they walk on the tip of their toe. OUCH!!! I like podiatrists in general. Take care, Annette""Ditto what Caprice said, go to a doctor and get a proper examination and medical history done by a qualified person. Anyone who tries to diagnose themself using the internet does a great disservice to themself. You are worth a trip to the doctor. Take care, Annette""I would talk to your doctor or pharmacist about this before you take any. I am not aware of any interactions between Tylenol and Celebrex (an NSAID). Everyone is different however, so ask your doctor. Take care, Annette""Why did you have the thoracotomy to begin with? Was it supposed to ""cure"" the pain you a were having? If the pain is the same as you had before the surgery, and never went away at all, I would question whether you have ""post thoracotomy pain syndrome"" or if you just still have the original pain that you started out with? A ""syndrome"" is a collection of symptoms, what else do you have besides the pain that you started with? I have never heard of this particular pain syndrome, but all surgery causes pain, numbness, and other indications that nerves were cut during the operation. It takes time for them to heal again. I took about a year, or a year and a half, after each surgery that I have had to completely recover. I continue to have some numbness in my neck just below my jaw from cervical disc surgery that I had back in 1992. I would suggest you see a pain management doctor, what kind of doctor do you see now? Is he a pcp, the surgeon who did the surgery, a neurologist, a PM specialist? Take care, Annette""I read that article that you posted the link to, at least I read most of it, scanned the rest, it said 50% also. I already Googled PTPSand read all about it. Although I have worked as a nurse for many years, most of it was in ICUs and ERs, not places where you see a lot of folks with this problem. I have taken care of lots of thoracotomies, but they were just barely out of surgery, after a few days most moved on to other areas of the hospital and I never saw them again. I have never claimed to know everything, neither have most doctors that I have worked with. Your initial post does say in the first paragraph that the pain has not come back, that it is worse than the pain that took you to the hospital, and it has been there the entire 14 months. I am sorry if I misunderstood you. That is just part of message boards, it is not the same as sitting face to face and asking and answering questions. It is not a big deal. Thanks for the further information. I get from your post that you are very angry about the whole experience. I would not pretend to know why your surgeon did what he did, or why you let him do it. When we are sick we often tel doctors decide for us what is best. That is fine as long as they are right, but they aren<APO>t always right. Where I have lived in the western US, I have been fortunate with the doctors I have dealt with, few if any were like the money grubbers you are talking about. My mom died of cancer at 69, I would have loved to have her until age 93. I hope you feel better soon. Take care, Annette""Why do you want an MRI? It is a diagnostic tool not a treatment, so it won<APO>t fix anything at all. Most of the time they really do not tell the doctor much anyway. Sometimes they are necessary and very useful, but often they are not. Is this a doctor you trust and feel comfortable with? Is she the OB-GYN that delivered your baby? Where are her strengths and weaknesses as far as medicine is concerned? When did your symptoms start? Take care, Annette""Hi, RobinCoy Since Allys25 did not mention the duration of time that she has had pain, and I am not able to examine her, I would not recommend just demanding an MRI, or changing doctors. A basic physical exam and medical history goes a long way in making a good diagnosis. Most back pain is self limiting, some people need further treatment and diagnostic tests. Dealing with depression is very important in dealing with chronic pain. They interact and cause an increase in pain. You can<APO>t fix the pain if you don<APO>t deal with the depression also. If you do fix the pain, the depression may fix itself, but it also may not... I am so glad that you have found decent treatment. Take care, Annette""If all the income you are surviving on is SSI from your husband<APO>s disability, you may be eligible for Medicaid. Each state does their own thing as far as requirements, etc. That said, a bulging disc rarely requires surgery. You didn<APO>t say where it was or what else you were currently doing for it. We will all have bulging discs eventually because we walk upright, and it puts a certain pull on our spines. Even herniated discs often do not require surgery. It sounds like you know what to do as far as exercise and stretching, etc. You mentioned a low B12, but didn<APO>t say if you were currently taking any B vits. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Since you rarely see a doctor it makes sense that he was cautious about prescribing prescription pain meds. They require some monitoring, and you have to have a trusting relationship with a doctor to get the best from any medicine program. I would see a neurologist about the headaches, if you need a specialist at all, many pain management doctors have little to no training in dealing with them. I would ask before making any appts. Better to have one doctor treat both your headaches and your back pain. My family doctor treated all my problems quite well. Take care, Annette""MRIs are seldom indicted for acute spinal injuries, and they do not tell with any reliability which patients should have disc surgery and which ones should not. I am very sorry that you feel the way you do, and that your daughter is traveling the same path. I personally would avoid chiropractors for any neck problems, the risk of stroke is too high. Take care, Annette""MRI tests are not good indicators of back pain. That said it is probably best to find a doctor that you feel good with and stick to him/her. As far as weight goes, I am afraid it is a matter of calories in, and calories burned. I have always been fat or obese. I have finally gotten under 180 lbs. for the first time in my adult life. I am very sorry to say that it IS a matter of exercise, and dieting. I took a class in chronic illnesses and weight was discussed. They suggested decreasing your intake by 100 calories a day and increasing your activities by 100 calories a day. They said you would slowly but surely lose weight this way. Yes, I had been told that before. But a dear friend of mine was recently diagnosed with Type II Diabetes, so it was a perfect storm. I saw an ad for a TV program on belly dancing, sounded interesting. So, I added one hour of belly dancing a day in front of the TV and DVR. I have not gotten around to dieting yet, and have lost over 70 lbs. in four years. I only dance an hour a day, with various DVDs, I only do it ALONE, no one gets to watch this old lady. I am over 60 years old. I have danced through surgery, by changing the isolations I do. When I am on vacation once a year at my son<APO>s home, I do not dance or do much of anything, beyond play with my grandson. All I am suggesting is to try whatever YOU will continue doing, something that moves your muscles, and that you like to do. Speak to your doctor before trying any kind of exercise, get his okay, and his support. I cannot imagine having a 2 year old child and trying to fit in yet more stuff in your 24 hour day. But, if you have time for injections or going to a chiropractor, you do have time for exercise. Put that kid in a stroller and mall walk, if that is what you can do at this point. He can take his nap in the stroller??? Take care, Annette""Cervical adjustments by a chiropractor can cause strokes. The vertebral arteries can tear causing bleeding up into the brain. This happened to a nurse friend of mine. She was affected on one side of her body, it took nearly three years for her to recover enough to go back to work. I have had adjustments to my lower back, and they did help, but I saw an MD first, and after he did his thing and it did not work, he recommended I see a chiropractor. I certainly agree with your other suggestions regarding basic lifestyle changes to see if they help. Take care, Annette""I take gabapentin, the original version of this med, it is generic now and not all that expensive. I have used it for over 10 years now, no problems yet, and like you I will keep on taking it for the effect it has in the present. Take care, Annette""Yes, if I were you, I would see a rheumatologist and find out why you have joint pain, swelling, etc. A good rheumy can tell a lot by just examining you and doing a careful medical history. A few blood tests and imaging studies may also be needed. Don<APO>t guess what is wrong with you see a good doctor. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I did not understand everything you were trying to say. CT scans aren<APO>t so bad, lots of people can<APO>t have MRIs for one reason or another. I have been very lucky in my doctors, they have generally been very good and treated me with caring and respect. Medical research is constantly evolving as they learn more and more about various things. I read in the paper today that a research group found that the PSA blood test for prostate cancer was not proving itself to be as useful as they thought it was, too many false positives, and too much invasive treatments done unnecessarily. Drugs that are seemingly great new things turn out to do more harm than good. But, on the other hand we have learned so much good stuff, that I think it usually balances out in the long run. I am not sure how ""socialized medicine"" will leave us all screwed because then ""they"" will have own their war on drugs??? How does how the doctors are paid for our medical care have a relationship to winning the war on drugs? That part I don<APO>t understand... Take care, Annette""I have both those diagnoses and others also, finding out what the name of the condition does not stop the pain as you already know. I have found a lot of good medical information at http://www.myalgia.com for the FMS. Research both your medical conditions. The OA can trigger the FMS pain so do what you can to control it before it gets bad. I have found heat and exercise to be very beneficial for my FMS as long as I found the right amounts of each, that is just trial and error. The right doctor can prescribe various medications for your symptoms, but again it is a matter of trial and error. Be as patient as you can. Take care, Annette""I would start with a neurologist for your polyneuropathy, and perhaps an opthamologist for your eye. Once you get a final diagnosis, then you can decide how to procede with treatments. Take care, Annette""Hi, You need to ask the doctor these questions, he should be able to tell you what to expect in your case after injections. He should also be able to tell you when he wishes you to call him and for what level of pain after injections. Same with meds, just tell him how the pain is preventing you from particular activities that you want to do, or from sleeping and how that affects your daytime activity, then let him make suggestions as to pain meds. Take care, Annette""Cognitive behavioral therapy techniques also have no side effects, and I have found them very useful in dealing with chronic pain. When starting biofeedback, 20% may not sound like a lot of relief, please remember that that would add up to 2 points on a 0-10 pain scale. That could potentially take you from a 7-8 to a 5-6, a significant reduction all by itself. Like you said already, this method has NO side effects at all. I truly believe that the experience of pain can be managed much more successfully with many different types of treatment modalities. Take care, Annette""Me, too. Hugs, Annette""Best of luck to you whatever you decide to try. It makes life hard when insurance companies dictate to doctors what they should order for their patients. Take care, Annette""Look up opioid induced hyperalgesia. It is rare, but does exist. Also not all pain responds to opioids. On the other hand, if it works why mess with it? Take care, Annette""This is a question for your prescribing doctor. I worked at a methadone clinic for heroin addicts back in the 1970s, but they know so much more about drugs and the treatments for pain and addiction nowadays. I believe you can still take ibuprofen, acetaminophen or other types of meds, or even non-drug therapies. Are you in pain now, or are you talking about just in case? What kind of pain do you have? Are you currently getting treatment for it? Make sure you see an addictions specialist along with pain management so you get treatment that is correct for both types of problems. This is SO important. Kudos to you for giving up the heroin and getting straight. Take care, Annette""You don<APO>t ever say that!!! The medicine dose is between a person and their doctor. Each person is different, and pain meds often cause tolerance anyway over time. Take care, Annette""Don<APO>t start at 30 minutes. Your goal should be 30 minutes a day, most days, but it should not be your starting off place. Start at 3 minutes, 2-3 times a day. Increase it by a minute or two once a week. Go slowly, and talk to your doctor, before you start an exercise program. Take care, Annette""I would just tell the doctor that things aren<APO>t going well for you right now, and you would like to know again what your options are for treatment. Ask about both drug and non-drug treatments. Let him know about the cost factor for you. Some drugs have cheaper generics available, and some brand name drugs are available through programs that the drug companies have to help people who need financial assistance. Try www.needymeds.com and see what is available to help you. I switched to methadone a couple of years ago because it is very cheap, I am happy with it. But make sure your doctor knows how to prescribe it correctly, and no adjusting the dose on your own. Take care, Annette""Post a throw-away email address and folks can reply privately if they know of anyone in your area. We are not allowed by the terms and conditions of use here to post doctors<APO> names or addresses. I would not post my private email address, I keep one for home use and another for on-line use, that way if I get a lot of spam I can opt to toss that one and start over. Take care, Annette""There are other pain med options to try that work for many people. I would see a pain management specialist that does all kinds of treatment modalities in addition to epidurals and other injections. My pcp manages my pain for me, and with the meds I am on, I am able to exercise about an hour a day, every day. She has adjusted the meds as needed to control pain that I avoided before by just not using my body. I have lost over 50 pounds with exercise alone, but the deal is I feel better than when I don<APO>t move around as much due to pain. I still have pain, but I do have meds to take if I need to. I also use my hot tub every night before bed, the only time I have no pain at all is when I am sitting in it. But it is good for those times. I have tried Baclofen for muscle tightness, but I only take a half of the regular dose and it leaves me too sedated for my liking. So I generally don<APO>t take it. Take care, Annette""Usually the Arthritis Foundation office in your town/city can give you the names of places near you that keep their pools warm enough for this purpose. Take care, Annette""Good luck to you. I hope it all turns out well. Please keep in touch if you can. Take care, Annette""Hi, Glad to hear things are going okay for you. Just wanted to let you know I was thinking about you. Hugs, Annette""Please, Beth, you were thinking what all of us think occasionally. How low an I go on my pain meds? Can I do without them? You had side effects that were difficult to tolerate, so it makes perfect sense to me. Would you feel the same way if you found out high blood pressure meds were necessary to your existence? Or would you wait until you had a stroke? Please do not feel defeated that the experiment showed you that you need opiates, now you know that for sure for now, and can move on to bigger and more important things in your life. You and I know for certain that the future is unknown, we have to take opioids now, but the future is a blank page. Anything can happen. Research is ongoing, and medicine is evolving constantly. I have been a nurse for over 40 years, my great aunt graduated from nursing school in 1915, things have changed, thank God. When she graduated from nursing school, only doctors took B/Ps, because it was a ""complicated procedure""? RNs did not even D/C IVs, just turned them off until the doctor got there to do it. Life changes, especially in medicine. Think of the changes in neuroscience in the last 15 years? Hugs, Annette""Good for you, Beth. You do whatever you think might help, as long as you keep your doctor in the loop. I decreased my methadone (30 mg. per day), by half after having breast reduction surgery in January. I did it slowly, about 5 mg. per day, once a week for a couple of weeks. I didn<APO>t have any withdrawals to deal with, but I was expecting them. Months later I increased my daily exercise and that resulted in more leg and hip pain, and I increased my bedtime dose to 10 mg. I also use the same breakthrough meds that you do, but take them a bit differently. Keep them at hand, just in case you need them, but I found I didn<APO>t really need mine more than usual. Take it one day at a time, and just balance the positive and negative effects that you find you get. That is what we all do, hopefully. I didn<APO>t get on the computer at all yesterday, sorry I am so late in replying. Hugs, Annette""If anyone can do it, you can!!! Just go slowly, very slowly, I believe that is key to lowering ones dose of opiates. I am glad to hear the episodes are fewer now. Hugs, Annette""When changing from one opiate to another, most doctors use a factor in their calculations for cross tolerance. This means that they often start out with a lower dose because a full ""equianalgesic"" dose might cause an overdose due to respiratory depression. As long as your husband keeps a careful pain journal and keeps his doctor informed about pain levels and side effects, if any, as he makes the transition from one drug treatment plan to another he should do fine. Your husband may need to see the doctor more frequently for awhile to make dose adjustments of the long acting morphine. This is to be expected, so he should not feel bad about it. Breakthrough pain is generally thought of as pain that your long acting opioid does not take care of due to extra activity, etc. It is not usually pain that you still have after taking a short acting pain med like Percocet or oxycodone IR, unless you are also taking a long acting med like MS Contin or its generic. I assumed the morphine sulfate he was changed to was a long acting generic, not a short acting type??? If so, it is a lower dose, a good starting off place for your husband. Does he take it once or twice a day? I started out on a generic morphine, long acting type at 15 mg. at bedtime so I could sleep through the night without waking up in pain. Many people start out twice a day and do just as well. Take care, Annette""You need to keep seeing your doctor and telling him/her about this pain, regardless of negative or positive findings on tests. Once you get an official diagnosis, folks here will be able to tell you what they have been diagnosed with, and what helped their pain. We cannot help you much until after you get a real diagnosis from the doctor. Take care, Annette""I totally understand your frustration at not getting a definite diagnosis. Unfortunately, that can take a long time, with lots of tests. The important thing is to KEEP seeing your doctor, KEEP telling him your pain levels and how they affect your ability to function in life. Make an appt. with your pcp if you do not already have one. Lots of diagnoses are made over time by a basic history and physical exam, together with many test results. When a test is negative, it is a GOOD thing for you, and will provide the doctor with a piece of the puzzle. There is no reason not to treat your symptoms while waiting to make a diagnosis. However, if your pain comes and goes without warning that can be hard to do. Keep a written account or journal of your symptoms, your memory is really not accurate enough. Just jot down the time each time you have a pain, the length of time it lasts, what part of your body is affected, give the pain a score from 0-10, (10 being the worst pain ever, and 0 being no pain at all), etc. Take this journal to your doctor and give him a copy to put in your medical record at every appt. It might help to take a friend or family member with you to the appt. as a witness to the conversation and to take notes for you, with a pen and paper. Sometimes this gets a doctor moving along. You know best what will work for you and your doctor. These are just some suggestions. Please keep coming back here, this is the right place for anyone with pain issues. Take care, Annette""I had a hip injection hurt like crazy afterwards for weeks, the pain even radiated down my leg. I am a nurse, and tried to manage it on my own, but finally saw my pcp. He was great, told me it happens sometimes, and gave me steroids by mouth for about ten days. The pain went away and never came back. Since I am a nurse, I do know that we are not all made like the books say, sometimes nerves or blood vessels are not where the books say they should be. Or the nurse giving the injection is feeling rushed and does not do it properly. There are lots of reasons this could happen, it is not a big deal. Go see your pcp and let him/her know what is going on. Take care, Annette""I agree, it is a bigger muscle and absorbs most medication well. That said, the nurse that hit my sciatic nerve gave the injection in the butt/hip area. I ended up on prednisone by mouth for a couple of weeks, that fixed things up. All of our nerves and blood vessels are not always where the books say they are, so I agree it is not necessarily the nurse<APO>s fault. Take care, Annette""I had a C 5-6 discectomy many years ago, I was lucky the function in my hand came right back. Surgeons, however, are not good at managing chronic pain. I would suggest you go see a pain management specialist that does many different types of therapies, not an interventionalist who just does injections, and invasive procedures. Take care, Annette""The only doctors I know that do not routinely have a DEA number are doctors that work in the military/VA systems (not needed there), and doctors that have been disciplined by the DEA and had their prescriptive privileges revoked. But that is just me. In my experience, and Dr. A. would know more about this, you need a DEA number to prescribe any meds on the controlled substance schedules. Take care, Annette""It is a conscious decision, to not suffer. I have pain at 5-6 levels most of the time, so what? I get tired, I rest. If I have a commitment, I stay up and do it, and rest later. I use cognitive behavioural therapy techniques, they do work, but you have to make a life of it. It is not a therapy that you do for 6 weeks and stop, you do it for life. It is hard work, but so worthwhile. Take care, Annette""Of course, I use medicines and other treatment methods also, and I would never turn down anesthesia for a surgical procedure. But, that has nothing to do with choosing not to suffer while one has pain. Suffering is different from having pain. I do make and keep commitments for various events and family functions, and I do plan recovery days into my schedule. I find the pleasure I get from these things far outweighs the pain. My doctor provides pain meds as I need, thank goodness for her, but I have never been without pain in nearly 15 years. You asked how those of us who opt not to ""suffer"" do it, I told you how I do it. I may well be on a different place in my path than you are. If you do not want to know, or you want to argue about whose pain is the worst, say so, and I will not waste my time replying. Until you have walked in my shoes, you do not get to judge me. Take care, Annette""If you can identify your ""upbringing, that you deserve"" to be sick or in pain as wrong, then you can change how you feel about that whole thing. That is just crazy to me. Take care, Annette""Hi, I am a RN also, disabled since 1998 or so, but I also keep my license up to date, at least it is in Calif. I am also hoping for a medical miracle. I have never lived in Florida so I am not much help with doctors. I found that interviewing a new pcp after talking to the office staff is best. They ALL say they don<APO>t give opioids to chronic pain patients, that is to weed out the drug abusers. I ignore that, and just tell them my story, and give them copies of my medical records, tests, etc. Also a list of my current meds. I am open to all types of pain management, and leave it up to them. So far, so good. I have always been able to get my pain meds along with whatever else I need. I give the new pcp 2-4 appts. to get to know me, trust is a two way street. They have always agreed to prescribe whatever I was on before. I have had to get consults with pain management specialists sometimes, no big deal. But, that is out here in Oregon, not in Florida. Best of luck. Take care, Annette""Good luck in your search! Taking your medical records with you is fine, but do not feel bad if they also ask for written releases so they can get copies straight from your old doctor. Some practices do that, because it is so easy for folks to change things in their records nowadays. Take care, Annette""Best of luck to you in your search. Take care, Annette""The ER usually has to refer you to a doctor that is qualified to help you. Generally, they take turns taking call so they must see you at least one time after your ER visit. Not for free though, they charge their usual rates. Have you connected with any of these doctors? Is back pain your major concern or bladder pain? The doctors that treat these two different things may have completely different specialties. Have you seen a Pain Management Specialist? Another option is to check with your health insurance company and see who can see you. If by ""real pain medicine"" you are alluding to opioids, that is not the way to evaluate a doctor as ""good"". The ER is not the place to go to be treated for chronic pain. Take care, Annette""I keep my meds on my bedside table with something to drink. I always take my meds a couple of hours before I get up. Percocet only lasts four-six hours so if you sleep any longer than that you will wake up in pain at least. Talk to your doctor again, then ask him for a referral to a different doctor if he can<APO>t help you. Take care, Annette""Oxycodone is the opiate in Percocets, plain oxycodone has no tylenol in it, just the opiate in the short acting form, 4-6 hours for most people. You are lucky that it lasts longer for you. Roxycodone is oxycodone. Oxycontin is oxycodone in a long acting form. Morphine is available in both short acting and long acting forms, so not all morphine is a time released formula. Take care, Annette""I would love to have this subscription if it is still available. Hugs, Annette""I think I remember you posting an email address on line before, if you don<APO>t mind posting it again, I will email you and we will figure this out. Thank you so much, I am really excited. Hugs, Annette""Email on the way. Thanks again. Hugs, Annette""First, Percocet and Percodan come in mg. not ml., I assume that was a typo, but it is important to let new folks know accurately what is going on. I worked at a methadone clinic for heroin addiction treatment back in the 1970s. I would ask at your clinic what is the usual dose of Percocet giving post op for orthopedic surgery, if they cannot help you, ask at a pain management clinic that is used to working with addicts on high doses of methadone. Meanwhile, answer the following if you wish to: When did you have your surgery done? How old are you? How long have you been on 220 mg. of methadone daily? Why are you on such a high dose? When did you last have an EKG done? Take care, Annette""You need to read the Percocet bottle really carefully, I am pretty sure that the 325 refers to acetaminophen, not the oxycodone in the pill. The brand name Percocet is generally dispensed in 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 mg. of oxycodone with 325 mg. of acetaminophen. Percodan comes in 5 mg. of oxydodone mixed with aspirin (ml. refers to a liquid measurement). My drug handbook does not list a liquid formula for Percodan, but it could always be wrong. Both of these formulas should not be given more than a certain number of times per day, due to the over the counter meds mixed with the opiate. Since your current clinic is not up on pain management, I would see a pain management specialist who also has experience in addiction treatment. You might do your own research on methadone, and QT prolongation, this is why my pain management doctor says folks on methadone need to have an EKG once a year. That seemed to be the general consensus when I read about it myself. Most articles I read said that 60 mg. a day seemed to be the cut off level, that or more, and QT prolongation was more of a problem. However, I read some studies that showed any dose of methadone was a concern. An EKG once a year is not a big deal for my own peace of mind. My pcp ordered it for me. Your surgery was nearly a month ago, so the worst of the pain might be over, but I am no expert on shoulder surgery, so I couldn<APO>t say for sure. Take care, Annette""Pain and surgery are all different for different people. For someone who has never had surgery before, any kind of surgery would feel major. I have not had shoulder surgery so I would not guess how she feels. I think it is great that you did not need pain meds after just a few days, I suspect that you are an unusual person. My experience with treating opiate addicts is that they need to KNOW that their physical pain will be controlled, and it often isn<APO>t due to a lack of knowledge about opiate addiction and pain management. Unfortunately, most specialists are only well educated/trained in one area, not both. I hope you do well in any future surgery you may have. Take care, Annette""Keep in touch. Take care, Annette""Good luck to you, I hope everything works out okay. Take care, Annette""Anytime you cannot get your breath, you should see your local ER or doctor immediately. It may be the medication, or it may be something else entirely. I hope you are feeling better. Take care, Annette""Butrans patches. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I should read more carefully. Right after I replied, I read your post correctly. Of course, you already know what he was talking about. Take care, Annette""I might also see an occupational therapist to see what other options you might have as far as your duty belt goes. OTs are wonderful people and I have found them helpful for both me and patients I have had in the past. I would print out and take any articles you find about the neurectomy to the neurosurgeon you see, and discuss the article fully. Studies depend largely on how the participants were chosen, how many there were in the study, and who paid for the study. Take care, Annette""I would also see a neurologist, in addition to the neurosurgeon. They see things from a different perspective. Perhaps you could get appts. for them on the same day, one in the AM and one in the PM??? I feel seeing a specialist at a major university teaching hospital is often helpful. They are up to date on the latest stuff. Most places that have PTs also have OTs. I worked for a home health agency for awhile, and the combination of a PT and an OT got many of my patients on their feet, and also kept them in their own homes, rather than in a nursing home. Take care, Annette""Best of luck to you. Let me know how things go. I flew from Reno to San Francisco for a neuro consult, he was great, no cure, but at least I knew we were on the right path. Take care, Annette""I would get a second opinion with an orthopedic specialist who does large joint replacements as his main thing, hips and knees. He or your present orthopedic doctor could refer you to PT for strengthening exercises. You might also ask for a referral to a pain management doctor to help you control your pain while you wait for surgery. How old are you? What is the cause of your knee problems? Would seeing a rheumatologist be useful? Take care, Annette""Hi, I remember you from the Fibro Board, I post more here than there. This Board is more treatment oriented with a bit of social stuff thrown in, the Fibro Board seems mostly social with a bit of treatment thrown in. Different strokes for different folks, lol. Any NEW or DIFFERENT pain should be reported to your doctor. I would start with your pcp, unless you know he would refer you to a specialist, in which case I would see a neurologist first, not a neurosurgeon. The pain is in a different place, it is not relieved much by your usual tools, so go see a doctor! I have always believed in this way of doing things, but my current pcp really thinks this is important. She had a FMS patient with new pain in her back that turned out to be a spinal tumor. Had the doctor not been on her toes, it could have been a disaster. It was removed and the patient did fine. It may turn out to be nothing important, it probably will, but better safe than sorry. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I wasn<APO>t more helpful. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""PS, I know that osteo and rheumatoid arthritis are completely different as far as progression, and treatment, but they both can leave you with ugly hands. Take care, Annette""A grand piano does require lots of space, my grandparents had a Steinway grand in the living room of their big house in SF. When they built an apartment in the downstairs of our house, my grandmother<APO>s only request (demand) was that her piano had its space in the living room. It did. They both played piano, and grandpa also played the violin. As did my mother. My dad and his siblings all took piano lessons when they were young, but I never heard any of them play at all. Rick likes his electronic piano, there are several good brands available. It is takes up the same floor space as an upright. Other than heat when I soak in the hot tub, and NSAIDs I am lucky enough not to need much help with my hands. I used to run hot water over them in the AMs from the tap before I went to work to loosen them up. Ask your rheumatologist what to do, RA is different than osteoarthritis, and the meds differ also. I take ""Arthritis Today"" magazine, it is well worth the $25 a year donation to the Arthritis Foundation. They have lots of useful into about arthritis and meds and all. I think it is bi-monthly. I like it because I know I can trust what they have to say. It is all pretty much evidence based stuff. Take care, Annette""Actually, my relatives only played on holidays, except Grandma, and Auntie Inga and their pianos. I learned violin, because my mom played when she was young so we had one, I still have it, though I don<APO>t play anymore. Later I learned clarinet, and basic, very basic guitar. I am no musician though. My present husband, we have been together since 1988, is the musician. Naprosyn kills my gut, I can<APO>t take even one. Ibuprofen is the one for me. I had stopped taking it after my neck surgery in 1992, but discovered after I had breast reduction surgery in this last Jan. that it does seem to help some with a certain kind of pain, so I am back taking it. Having renal problems must really limit the meds you are allowed to take??? Getting under my electric blanket on the couch will be my nice thing for today. Typing on the computer is done at my desk and I am getting really cold now, lol. It is always nice to meet new people here, hope to see you again. Take care, Annette""My dad<APO>s Auntie Inga (just Inga) was an RN, she graduated from a hospital school of nursing in SF, Calif., in 1915 and worked until the mid 1960s as a RN in Calif. She had great stories to tell about nursing. I asked her once what the best change was in nursing over the years of her career. She said ""trousers"" for a uniform, lol. She had worked with everything from long woolen uniform dresses with linen aprons, collars and cuffs to miniskirts towards the end of her career, but pant suits were the best to work in she said. She was also an OR nurse for the first conjoined twin separation in SF, she had lots of stories to tell. She died in her late 80s, she was probably why I became a nurse. Tell me about your Auntie Inga??? Hugs, Annette""If you have been diagnosed with RA, I would see a rheumatologist rather than my PCP. You need a specialist who deals with RA and is up on the latest info. Give your sweetie written info about RA and scoliosis from reliable sources such as that put out by the Arthritis Foundation. Give him time to read it and process it all. Since you have always driven through other issues, it may take him (and the rest of your family) awhile to figure out that this is something different, and you may also be a different person now. We all change as we get older. Give them all time to get to know the new you. You may need to see a psychologist also, adjusting to a new chronic illness may take you some getting used to. I used cognitive behavioural therapy to deal with my chronic issues and get past the depression that they caused. But, I did get past it. Take care, Annette""I am as vain as you are when it comes to my hands. I have the beginnings of arthritic changes in my right hand, I hate it. But, there is nothing I can do about it. DO NOT give up music or any activities that you use your hands for. My great aunt swore that playing the piano kept her hands going long after they should have stopped due to arthritis. She died at about 88 and still played whenever she could. The other side of my cousin<APO>s family has autoimmune issues, they all have multiple illnesses. You are right, you already know about these things, having Crohn<APO>s disease, that doesn<APO>t make things any easier for you though...maybe even tougher? Something to explore with your therapist maybe? This too will pass...hold that thought. Take care, Annette""My husband is the musician in our house, I got him a Kurzweil electronic piano years ago, he loves it. He played professionally for many years. It has a full sized keyboard, and many different ""voices"". It also has headphones, so he can play as loud as he wants and not disturb anyone. He also does percussion, but that has always been more of a hobby kind of thing for him. Best of luck with the rheumy, I bet he can help you. Take care, Annette""I am so impressed by you!! Your injuries far outweigh my illnesses as far as I am concerned. I have pain, but structurally my body is pretty good. I was diagnosed with arthritis in my hands 40 years ago, after a brief time it stopped bothering me, I am not sure the diagnosis was correct. But recently I saw a rheumy and he also said I had arthritis in both my hands, I can see where my fingers are starting to bend laterally on the tips on one hand, I have nodes on both hands, little pain though. An RA factor done many years ago was negative. I suspect it is osteoarthritis, since that was not the reason I saw the rheumy, and it doesn<APO>t really bother me yet, other than not being pretty, we moved on to what I was really there for. The DDD in my neck also shows arthritic changes. My neurosurgeon said I had the neck of a 90 year old, lol, but again, as long as it is not bothering me at the moment, I tend to ignore it. Take care, Annette""What does your orthopedic doctor suggest for you to do? I assume you have seen him and told him that you are doing your exercises, but not getting any sleep at night. Take care, Annette""I am not sure why you do not want to take meds, but that is your decision. Just make sure it is an informed decision. Discuss it with a trusted doctor. ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"" by Dr. Margaret A. Caudill, MD, PhD is a great book. Try reading it through, it also has useful pages at the back that you can tear out and copy to use to track your pain. Take care, Annette""An<UD>241067, By the way, RA can affect your organs also, not just your joints. Some of the meds for RA are to prevent the progress of this disease. Talk to your rheumatologist. Take care, Annette""That would depend on the results of the MRIs I assume you have had done by your neurologists. You could ask them... Personally, I have had similar problems with cervical radiculopathy, FMS, etc. My husband<APO>s old chiropractor in Reno, whom we both trusted very much, told me to NEVER, EVER let a chiropractor near my neck as he could do real damage. A nurse friend of mine many years ago had a stroke while the chiropractor was doing a cervical adjustment, and was taken to the hospital via ambulance from his office. It took three years for her to recover the use of the side of her body that was affected by the stroke and go back to work again. I later read up on the research at that time, and apparantly the vertebral arteries can tear during an adjustment and bleed up into the brain, causing a stroke. Some folks will say that of course, MDs will complain about chiropractors, but I have had MDs tell me to try a chiropractor under certain circumstances for lower back pain, and it did work for that. Talk to the doctor that you trust the most and ask his advice based on the tests you have already had done, if necessary get more tests. But, I would not go to a chiropractor unless my MD gave me the okay. And of course, I would never let them near my neck. Personal decision of my own. Take care, Annette""Radiculopathy is just part of life for me. I avoid keeping my head/neck in certain positions that I know will cause a problem. Read Charles<APO> post carefully. Try all the different treatment modalities, saving the invasive ones for last. I think in addition to what he mentions I have used cognitive behavioural therapy to good avail. You become accustomed to pain, at least I have. I never really expect to be pain free, just have well managed pain. My levels are currently about 4-5, out of 10, on meds, much higher off of them. They do spike higher at times, and I have BT meds for that. The thing is that you have to keep using whatever works even a little bit for life. So for me, that means I use CBT, my hot tub daily, exercise daily, oral meds (both non-opioid and opioid) daily, a TENS unit, Lidoderm patches, etc. Although I used a trigger point type injection once given by my pcp, I have avoided all other injections, and surgical procedures, other than a cervical discectomy 20 years ago. I had that done when I was losing the use of my fine motor skills in my dominant hand, not for pain control. It worked for that. My neurosurgeon refused to do any disc surgery for pain relief, he said it just wasn<APO>t good for that. For any treatment you try, I would discuss with your doctor what his and your definition of success is. His may be a 50% reduction in pain, yours might be being pain free, one of you might be thinking of function and the other of pain, you may not agree on terms you use, let alone what treatments to try. Get that out of the way first. Take care, Annette""Thank you for your service. My son did eight years in the Marines, and got out with a 90% disability rating, when they added it all up. Thank goodness he is all right! I can<APO>t believe you managed to do a whole 22 years, I am impressed. All I can suggest at this point is don<APO>t do whatever makes it hurt more, lol. I know that sounds flip, but I really mean it. I wouldn<APO>t hang your arm out the window or rest the forearm on the windowsill until after you find out for sure that it is not making things worse. Take care, Annette""Have you tried Lidoderm patches? You can cut them up to fit the part of your foot that is affected. They are pricey, but they do work for me for burning skin on the backs of my knees. Gabapentin also helps. My doctor was unable to find any diagnosis that fit, as I am not diabetic either. We just blame it on my FMS. Take care, Annette""I generally agree with Charles. I think disc replacement is the surgery of the future for many people, but I think many more studies need to be done so the doctors can choose the right patients who will have good outcomes, and then surgeons need to be trained how to do this surgery well. I would only see doctors who have already done 100 artificial disc replacements and who continue to do at least 4-5 a week. I believe this is true for most kinds of procedures because those numbers are what it takes for a surgeon to become proficient and to maintain proficiency at a particular kind of surgery. Their risks of complications go down and as they become more proficient the length of time the surgery takes is shortened also. That decreases risks for patients from being under anesthesia, and from getting infections in the wounds. Take care, Annette""Welcome to the group, Kim. Unfortunately, drugs work with everyone differently. I love my neurontin, I take a generic version daily, have for over 10 years now. I used to take tramadol, but have moved on to other things now. I never had any serious side effects with either one of them. I continue to use CBT techniques and belly dance at least an hour a day. So, I hope when you say ""Prior to that,..."" you still use CBT and Yoga/tai chi for pain management, and just for making your life better. I don<APO>t know how old you little guy is, but maybe he could do yoga/tai chi along with you? Or his version anyway. Take care, Annette""I found the neurontin needed to be adjusted upward until I got decent relief. I take it once a day, around suppertime, and went up to 1800 mg. then back down to 800 mg. per day. My doc had me increase it by 300 mg. per day once a week until I got good relief. Same thing going down, 300 mg. per day, once a week. Later I switched to 800 mg. tablets because I could get it in one pill, rather than taking several to get 900 mg. The only side effect I got was feeling kind of drunk for a couple of hours after taking the medicine. That went away after a few weeks of a stable dose. Back when I used to take tramadol, I did need to take 100 mg. to get any effect at all. When it first came out, I was still working and my doctor at the time only tried me on 50 mg. at a time, so when it didn<APO>t work, we moved on to other meds. Looking back, I think if I had been taking 100 mg. things would have worked out, for awhile at least. Do not wait to take any pain meds that are ordered as needed, take them when the pain starts if it is within the time frames your doctor suggested. You will get better pain control than when you wait until the pain is really bad. Just keep talking to your doctor, try different doses, different times, etc., try to wait out any side effects, they often go away over a few weeks. Take care, Annette""All you can do is get together with your doctor and try different opiates and see if one of the others is better for you. Another option is to adjust the dose and see if a lower dose or different timing of the doses taken will help you. I personally believe that adjusting the dose is best, as no good medical studies that I am aware of show any difference in the efficacy or side effect profile of the different opiates. The side effects that you mentioned seem to be fairly common with opioids of all types. But, treating any depression that you have appropriately might help, as those are also effects of depression. Do you currently see a psychologist or therapist of any kind? Take care, Annette""""Confused"" about what? Take care, Annette""Talk to your doctor. Let him know where the pain is what the quality of the pain is, and how long it seems to last. That is all stuff he needs to know to make a diagnosis properly. Gastritis is an inflammation of the stomach lining, the pain sounds a bit low for gastritis, check with the doctor. Take care, Annette""I would ask the doctor if she could take her meds under their supervision, then come back at a pre-set time and have both a urine screen and a blood screening for the klonopin. I had a random drug screening at work once while I was taking klonopin and vicodin, both daily, and it came up negative for all drugs including benzos and opiates. Go figure, they didn<APO>t care because they wanted a negative test for work. My doctor has never asked for a drug screen in the ten years I have been seeing her. Take care, Annette""The half life for klonopin is up to 59 hours, so it is unlikely it is not in her system at all if she takes it daily. Many of the drug tests only come up positive if your level is above a certain point. If her dose is relatively low, it may come out negative because it doesn<APO>t cross that threshold. Take care, Annette""Doctors do drug screens for several reasons, but one of them is to ensure that you ARE indeed taking your pills as prescribed. Doctors are afraid of patients selling their drugs on the street rather than taking them. It is sad, but many people do this. Take care, Annette""I didn<APO>t see that Gail had already answered this question. Take care, Annette""There is not any real way to tell what dose you will need if the doctor has never changed your opiates before. Usually, they start out at 50% of the equianalgesic dose, and then adjust from there until you have decent pain control. If you just take the same dose converted over to morphine, or whatever new drug you opt for, you may indeed overdose, as there is only a partial cross tolerance with opioids. Take care, Annette""DO NOT look on line for medical information to use on yourself without medical assistance. Call your doctor or pharmacist for drug information. Each of us has different medical histories that could complicate our response to medications of various kinds. Dextromethorphan was studied for pain relief many years ago and it was shown not to be useful. Benedryl (diphenhydramine), over the counter, says to take 25-50 mg. at any one time. I am not sure where you got the 75 mg., perhaps Wikipedia. You state you know it is not a reliable place to get medical info, but you do it anyway??? Even over the counter medicines have ill effects for some people, especially if taken above the doses recommended. Take care, Annette""See a doctor as soon as you can. If the nail is all bruised looking, it may have blood under the nail, which is very painful. Any doctor can make a small hole in the nail and drain the blood out, instant pain control. You will still have to keep it elevated, but it should feel much better. Take care, Annette""Do a search on any search engine for free/low cost doctors or medical clinics in your town. You might find someone to see. Otherwise there is not much to do for it, except keep it elevated while the swelling goes down, that can take weeks. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""You should discuss this with your doctor, I do not know if it is related to the tramadol or not. Take care, Annette""I have been taking gabapentin for the last 12-14 years. As long as it works for me, I will continue to take it. Are you having any side effects? I felt kind of drunk at first, but once the dose was settled on, all that went away. Take care, Annette""You should see your regular family doctor to start out with. He will let you know if you need to see a specialist. Your OB doctor may be able to suggest ways to get more comfortable in bed, so you rest better at night. Many people are more comfortable laying on their side with a pillow between their legs to maintain proper alignment of their spine. This worked for me when I was pregnant. Bed rest is no longer recommended for back pain. Being pregnant is a normal state for women, our bodies are made to adjust to the growing size of our abdomens during pregnancy. Unless you are expecting multiple babies you shouldn<APO>t get ""too large"" for your spine to handle. After your baby comes, you should look into learning exercises/yoga to strengthen your back and abdominal muscles that you do all the time, not just when you begin to hurt. Strong core muscles help support your weight better than weak ones. Take care, Annette""Lortab has acetaminophen in it, there are limits to how much of that you can take in a day or you risk liver damage. I have never used Suboxone, perhaps someone else can let you know how it worked for them. That said, it often takes a little while and a few dose adjustments when you change to a new pain med to find the right dose and dosing interval for you. Keep a pain journal and share it with your pain management doctor. Keep in touch. Take care, Annette""I have cervical spine problems and I also have migraines, after surgery the migraines were no better, and the doctor never told me they would be better. Oh well... With your whole neck fused, I would expect to have less to no range of motion in your neck. Surgeons are not trained to manage chronic pain, so ask your surgeon or your pcp to refer you to a pain management specialist if you need a referral, otherwise find one yourself. My neck surgeon was excellent at surgery, but lousy at pain management, he left me on hydrocodone for maybe two months, then I got it from my pcp. Take care, Annette""I would see the doctor or call his office and let him know what is going on. There is no way for some stranger on the internet to make a diagnosis for you. Take care, Annette""If you wish to get off of the fentanyl, speak to your doctor and have him monitor your withdrawal. Get instructions from him regarding the best way to taper off of it. I would get my medical information from a live medical doctor, not a dead senator. Take care, Annette""Ask your current neurologist for a referral to another specialist if he can<APO>t figure out what to do. Plaquinel is not a drug used for FMS. It is commonly used for Lupus or RA, autoimmune diseases. I would ask the doctor again exactly why you are taking it. A rheumatologist is one kind of doctor who deals with both FMS and autoimmune disorders like Lupus and RA. If you haven<APO>t seen one, perhaps it might be useful. Take care, Annette""Many pain medicine patches will release too much medicine into the blood stream if you heat your skin up with a heating pad, you could overdose on the medicine. For this reason, I prefer to use my hot tub every day, so I don<APO>t use patches, just pills. Take care, Annette""I would see a good orthopedic doctor and let him measure your legs and he can tell you if you need the orthotics or not. Ditto with the MRIs and other tests, he can take a decent medical history and do a proper examination, and tell you what to try next. I agree with Swank about the chiropractor, if it was going to help, it should have fixed things by now. See a good orthopedic specialist first to get a real diagnosis. Take care, Annette""I can only tell you what I have read and learned over the years. Meperidine is rarely used any more due to its metabolites causing toxic side effects. Levorphanol is more popular here in Oregon than it used to be. I personally use methadone as it is very cheap. I personally feel that all the opioid type meds work about the same, with similar side effect profiles. I do not really believe that any one has been proven with good, evidence based medical studies to be better than another. If you are thinking of trying levorphanol, speak to your pharmacist and find out the cost and availablilty in your area. I also take gabapentin and have for over 10 years now. The side effects wore off after awhile on a steady dose. I do know exactly what you mean by the ""drunken"" side effects. I take my whole dose a few hours before bedtime, rather than several times a day. Works fine for me. Lyrica did not work any better and it costs a whole lot more. In my opinion, benzos are bad news for most people over time. I have used clonazapam and it did not help any nerve pain that I had. When I finally stopped taking it after 3-4 months, I had withdrawals that needed to be managed medically. I was taking a very small dose once a day at bedtime. I have never tried Lacosamide, it is a seizure medicine, not approved for pain. Perhaps it works like gabapentin, which is also a seizure med., I do not know. My personal advice is to give whatever drug you decide to try at least 8 weeks, many side effects go away with time. Talk to your doctor, then research whatever drug you are considering. Take care, Annette""Tramadol and Effexor both can cause serotonin increases but they are not like each other in how they work otherwise or what they are usually used for. Tramadol is exclusively used for pain as it works on opioid receptors in a similar way as opiates do. Effexor is used mostly as an antidepressant, but many antidepressants are also used for chronic pain as they increase the serotonin in the blood and many people believe that increased plasma levels of serotonin will also help pain. I opt not to use antidepressants for my chronic pain because I have had problems with them and they did not help my pain. Many people do find them useful. I prefer to read, and set far more store in, evidence based medical studies than anecdotal information. I feel it is important to know how many people were included in each study and how they were chosen to participate, who paid for the study, how long the study lasted, etc. A study that lasted six weeks, paid for by a drug company making the drug being studied, and including only 20-30 people is essentially worthless except to determine that you need further research. These are sometimes the basis for the headlines that our news outlets offer us though. I was not suggesting that you personally believe anything you read. Take care, Annette""I really like methadone. I started taking it about two years ago, as I wanted the cheapest thing available to avoid the donut hole in Medicare drug coverage. My doctor gave me 10 mg. twice a day, and then increased it to three times a day later on when the pain would not stay down the whole 12 hours. However, I started out with 5 mg. and worked very slowly up to 10 mg. Only because I have had previous experience with this drug as a nurse, I prefer to start low and gradually increase it to where one has good pain relief, then wait several days, then try and back it down a bit if possible. I had breast reduction surgery in January, and was able to decrease my dose back down to 5 mg. three times a day, I cut it in half. After about six months my hip and leg pain increased so the doctor told me I could take 10. mg at night if I wished, and stay at 5 mg. for the other two doses. I have been doing that, and am able to dance for exercise for 60 minutes a day. If I go longer than that, my pain levels go UP. Discuss with your doctor exactly what your pain levels are and use the methadone according to his recommendations. I would ask him now what to do for constipation, as it may be a problem later on, it is so common, better to be prepared. It is hard to tell with just one headache if it was related to the drug dose or not. Wait and see, keep track of any new or different symptoms. Above all, talk to your doctor like you have been doing. I would give any new drug at least 4-6 weeks before I discussed changing it, unless the side effects were truly unbearable. Take care, Annette""I think people who have problems write more than people who do not, so that is what we read about. I have worked as a nurse in methadone treatment centers many years ago, and we could taper patients off slowly and many never had any withdrawal symptoms at all. My husband has been on morphine and percocet back years ago, for cancer pain and he went off with no withdrawals at all (before I knew him). He has been on methadone twice for months to years at a time during our marriage and I tapered his when he asked me to, he got off of it within a month or two with no withdrawals at all, both times. He takes no opiates at all now. He had his hip replaced, and takes Aleve when he has pain. I had no withdrawals when I cut mine in half, so I expect minimum to no withdrawal symptoms if and when I ever decide to taper off slowly. Since I worked with heroin addicts who had used injected opiates for twenty years or more, and they told me withdrawal was like a bad case of the flu, but it only lasted a few days, to a week or two, I just don<APO>t worry about it. I could do that if it came down to it, it is the chronic pain that would get me down. Take care, Annette""No one should EVER self medicate with methadone!! You NEVER take an extra one because your pain is worse that day, it is not for break through pain. That is how people die. Stay in close contact with your doctor, and I believe it is best to have a family member aware of your medication changes so they can keep an eye on you. Methadone can cause respiratory depression and death when used incorrectly. ALWAYS keep ALL your meds, especially opioids, LOCKED in a lock box, do not leave them where anyone else can get to them. Methadone is completely different in its action from the other opiates, it is naturally long acting. You may well stop breathing if you decide to take more than your doctor has prescribed. Take care, Annette""It was not to you, just in response to the entire discussion about methadone. It is being prescribed more often now than it used to be for chronic pain and more deaths are happening, sometimes due to people self medicating, using methadone like the other opioids they may have used previously. Just a warning to everyone who might ever come into contact with it. Take care, Annette""Thank you for the kind words. I have been an RN (presently retired due to disability) for over 40 years, but in chronic pain myself for only the last 16 or so. I kind of get information from both sides of the coin. I would stay away from the meperidine if you can even find a doctor willing to prescribe it anymore. Constipation is a side effect that is common to all of the opioid family of drugs, along with many other families of drugs. I would discuss with your doctor what to do about that. If you have had constipation with one opioid, you will probably have it with all of them. Most pcps have bowel formulas that they prefer, not all of them include laxatives until nothing else works. Perhaps you will find one that does not give you this side effect, but I doubt it. Keep looking and trying different meds, etc., I have a really long list of failed treatments, but my present ones work pretty well. Take care, Annette""I have taken tramadol and the occasional Imitrex type drug for migraines. I believe that the interaction that you are afraid of is serotonin syndrome, it can be more frequent if multiple drugs that affect the serotonin levels in the blood are taken. My doctor told me the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and what to do if it happened and left it up to me to decide if I wanted to take both drugs or not. I did and had no problem at all. I took them together for years, although my use of the migraine medicine was limited as I took it as needed, not regularly. Take care, Annette""I personally have had no w/d symptoms at all when I stopped antidepressants in the past. (TCAs, SSRIs and SNRIs for me). Neither has my son or my present husband (not related to my son) when they stopped antidepressants, same types. Nor have I had any w/d symptoms with discontinuing tramadol. I have been on both tramadol and Effexor, along with many other antidepressants. I no longer use antidepressants because they do not work for me, and I have had ill effects with them. My husband has had no w/d symptoms when he stopped taking opioids. I like to think it was due to my brilliant management of his pain meds during tapering, but I doubt it. He doesn<APO>t write on the computer at all, so you wouldn<APO>t get his opinion. I take everything I read with a grain of salt depending on who wrote it, and where. I currently use gabapentin, a sleep aid, and opioids. I do not feel ""chained"" to the opioids, any more than I would feel chained to heart meds if I needed them. ""High"" doses are relative with opioids, everyone needs a different dose. I do have Lidoderm patches on hand, but have not needed them in awhile, I find that they only help with specific types of pain. Please remember that you should decide what your treatment plan should be after discussing it with the psychiatrist and your pain management doctor. If you wish to stay on your present treatment plan, you should. If you wish to try the psychiatrist<APO>s plan, do that. Naturally, the prescribing doctor has the power of veto, as he should. Take care, Annette""I would be far more concerned about the alcohol you are drinking than the small dose of hydrocodone/APAP that you take. As long as you get liver function tests done regularly it should be fine. That is a simple blood test, no big deal. Again, I would stop drinking alcohol for awhile, and see how you do with out it. A six pack a day is too much. Take care, Annette""It sounds like some of your hobbies are activities where you would mainly use your dominant arm. Perhaps you could learn to use your other arm for things like throwing the ball, casting the fishing pole, etc. It takes determination to learn to use your other arm, but it is possible. My dad injured his dominant hand when I was little and it never regained complete function. He learned to do everything with his left hand that he had previously done with his right, including handwriting, fishing, basketball, etc. It wasn<APO>t easy but it really taught us kids something positive about keeping after a goal no matter how difficult it is. It pretty much goes along with the last part of your post. Take care, Annette""When one is given general anesthesia, or even IV sedation and a spinal, the anesthesiolgist uses a group of medicines. Some are stored in fat cells and release very slowly over time. My doctor told me about 6-8 weeks. This can alter your perception of pain for quite awhile. I had breast reduction surgery last January, and was able to cut my methadone in half within 2-3 weeks after surgery. I had much less back/shoulder pain, but also had less hip and leg pain than prior to surgery. It was about six months later that the hips and legs started hurting more again. My surgeon said that she injects strong anti-inflammatory steroids among other things during surgery. It made my blood sugar jump up for a short time. But, I think the steroids helped with my general pain also. Her nortryptaline and Prozac are both antidepressants but they target different neurotransmitters. Nortryptaline is a tricyclic antidepressant, and Prozac is a SSRI. It is not that uncommon to use both at one time. Losing even a small amount of weight can also improve outcomes. It sounds to me like Vivian is doing all the right things to be well. Take care, Annette""I would recommend just being honest with your doctor. Be aware he may not give you what you want at first. Six months from now, you could either be forming a good relationship with a doctor or be in the same place you are now??? Take care, Annette""All I can suggest is to keep on going to the free clinic and try whatever they suggest. If you become a familiar face it may help. This is healthcare in the US, best in the world if you have access to it??? Meanwhile do what ever you can do to help out the free clinic you use. Time filing is better than nothing, if that is what they need. Take care, Annette Take care, Annette""There are many drugs that sound alike, so to prevent mistakes from being made they capitalize some of the letters so folks will pay attention and not take the wrong drug. It is also common in hospitals, nursing, and journals. Think tramadol and toradol, both are for pain although they act completely differently, one works on opiate receptors and the other is an NSAID. The dosage is different also. There are lots of them like that. I always check my drugs and labeling when I pick up my meds at the pharmacy, and ask the pharmacist if I have any questions. Take care, Annette""I had the same kind of surgery and had similar sensations. It is normal as they must cut through some nerves in the skin as they go into the wrist. It can easily take a year or so to go away completely. Take care, Annette""I would just keep going back to the pediatrician, or the GI doctor, and tell him the problems are still there, and what exactly her symptoms are. Then ask him what you should try next. Best of luck to you both. Take care, Annette""The success rate for cervical surgery and lumbar surgery is very different. Just think about it, the neck only holds up the head, the lower back holds up the rest of your body, except your legs. I do not know that I would even consider lumbar surgery again with your history. Be glad that neurologists do not do surgery at all, only neurosurgeons do. I hope you were honest with him about the effects of prior treatments. Tell us, how did it go? Take care, Annette""Our little one is doing great. Money is always tight these days. My son was finally approved for 60% disability from the Marines, it took forever, but that will be a bit extra every month. My dear DIL is hoping to finish her bachelor<APO>s degree this year, she has been working on it one class at a time for ages. I am so proud of them all. If you start out with a healthy liver, I don<APO>t think you need to worry about anything less than 2,000 mg. of tylenol a day as long as you don<APO>t drink alcohol. The tylenol will only be temporary until the roxicodone is available again. Fatty liver is not generally related to things like cirrhosis or liver failure. It is usually related to the amount of cholesterol in your system. For most people it is a benign diagnosis. Your doctor should be able to tell from your liver function tests if your liver is functioning normally. They are blood tests, easy to do. A friend of mine takes a generic oxycodone/APAP 10/650 three times a day without any problem. He has taken it for several years now. Switching from one long acting opiate to another is a pretty common practice to delay tolerance. I am a generic drug person, so I use a generic long acting morphine twice a day instead of Kadian, Avinza, or MS Contin which are brand name long acting morphine products. It is cheaper and works just as well as far as I am concerned. Of course, this will probably start an argument about generic vs. brand name drugs, but, oh well.... Hope all goes well with you and your family. Take care, Annette""It sounds like you and your doctor have everything under control. Let me know how things go. Take care, Annette""Please see an orthopedic specialist for a diagnosis of your hip problem. Take care, Annette""I would see an orthopedic specialist for a definitive diagnosis. You may need advanced imaging techniques for him to actually make a diagnosis at all. Take care, Annette""Good luck to you with your appt. on Monday. My Grandad went to see his old urologist when his leg went bad on him because he really liked him. When the urologist told him he would have to see an orthopedist for the new problem, Grandad said, ""You went to medical school, can<APO>t you just think back to that?"" He still ended up seeing an orthopedic doctor in the end. Take care, Annette""What a mess, I don<APO>t really think my grandad was right, just that he was a funny old guy, who hated doctors. He figured if he found one he liked he should stick with him. I don<APO>t know what happened with your doctor, I don<APO>t know exactly how your medical system works. Can you make an appt. with him and ask him directly what he meant to recommend for you? It could all be a communication booboo... Whatever happens, perhaps it would be best to get a written referral in your hand, and make your own appts. (after checking them out of course). I have done that for many years, I just told my doctor that with my work schedule it was easier to make my own appts. Now, I don<APO>t even have any excuse, I just ask for it. I have never had any problems that way with him telling me one thing, and his staff ordering something else. Take care, Annette""There is no where that medical care is ""free"". It is just how it is billed. Some countries choose to tax people and use that money to pay for healthcare, others, like ours do it up front with the patient and the providers doping their deal with whatever insurance company is involved. What costs the most is up for discussion. I believe the US system is more costly than the other options that have universal coverage, but no insurance companies are involved for basic care. In Oregon, where I live (the government supplied insurance for poor people is called Medicaid) Medicaid only pays for a certain number of illnesses depending on what amount of money they have available for healthcare. If your illness falls further down the list, the state government will not pay for it. You also do not get health care just because you are poor enough to qualify, that is also dependent on the resources available. They had a lottery recently for single adults without kids to let a certain number of folk on the program. There is a state program for kids to get insurance from. Without ""free clinics"" run by volunteers life would suck for many sick people here. My nurse friends from Canada that I met over the years working, all went home to Canada for any chronic illnesses. They liked the care they got in Canada. Everyone is different. Take care, Annette""Best of luck to you, I hope everything works out okay. Take care, Annette""Then start going through the steps they require. Many insurance companies in the US also require a referral and failed therapies first are common. If your GP is a good one he will order the right things. I have rarely needed specialists except for surgery, because I have been fortunate with my primary care doctors. Just keep seeing your GP, if they don<APO>t hear from you, they assume you are doing better, it doesn<APO>t sound like you are. Take care, Annette""I have not had but one cortisone/anesthetic injection that worked, it was in a spot in my upper back/shoulder, my pcp did it for me. I had had shoulder pain for months and it fixed it all up within hours, never came back. She warned me that she had not done many of them and gave me the option of seeing an ortho instead or in addition to what she did. I had an ortho give me injections in my wrist for deQuervain<APO>s many years ago, didn<APO>t work, I ended up having the surgery. Took 7 minutes, should have done that at the start, lol. However, twice I have used 7 days of oral steroids prescribed by my pcp for knee pain while I was waiting to see the specialist, both times the pain went away and stayed away for at least five years the first time and about ten this last time. I would not repeat oral steroids like that more than once a year or so. The ortho specialist told me that was fine, follow it with NSAIDs and call him if the pain came back. He offered me an MRI, injections into the joint, and arthroscopic surgery to ""clean it out"". He was willing to explain the pluses and minuses about all treatments, and let me make up my own mind. If it starts hurting again I will go see him, if I can find his name in my records, lol. I agree, unless you realy trust your pcp, I would have an ortho do any injecting into joints. Some pcps know what they are doing with a needle and some do not, most do not. Take care, Annette""I began using cognitive behavioral therapy for depression many years ago, and continued using it for pain management with excellent results. Any kind of distraction also helps with pain management. I just hope that we are able to use all kinds of treatments, including meds, to help with pain management. I feel that a small amount of positive improvement from EACH of several interventions adds up to a great deal of relief, and is far better than being limited to only one or two interventions. When I graduated from nursing school Valium was the most prescribed drug in the world, now it is Vicodin. Drug abuse also needs to be treated, but not at the expense of folks with real pain that needs to be treated for that. Valium is not nearly as prevalent as it used to be, Vicodin will probably follow that path. I can remember several different drugs that were ""the most prescribed in the world"", they weren<APO>t all evil drugs, some just turned out not to be as great as the drug companies claimed them to be. I am not sure we need millions of dollars of research to show that we can use things we have used for many decades for pain management. I don<APO>t think we have the money to spare right now. The article was interesting though, and brought up food for thought for many people. Take care, Annette""I would again suggest you use all types of treatments for your pain. I use oral meds, Lidoderm patches, my hot tub, exercise, massage, etc. I include exercise in my treatment plan and for now have maxed out at one hour of belly dancing every day. I tried a more challenging Zumba program but had terrible pain in my legs and hips. It scared the heck out of me so I backed down for now. It took a few days, but the pain levels came down too. I see my doctor again in January and we will discuss it then. She has always been willing to treat my pain as needed and has told me we can increase the meds if my pain goes up due to more movement. She said, ""No one should have to lessen their activity due to pain."" I think that was a great thing that she said, it makes me feel more positive about things. I think approaching your doctor based on function might be better than addressing pain directly. I feel it is easier for them to understand that you need to be able to get up, and clean your home, and fix your meals, take care of your kids, etc. Tell him exactly what YOU want to be able to do and ask him the best way to get there. As you go along you should attain some of your goals and make new ones. Do not expect to be totally without pain, I doubt that is realistic for most of us. Take care, Annette""I would get a second opinion from a migraine specialist, rather than a pain management specialist. Managing migraines is very different from other kinds of pain, not all pain management specialists are trained to manage migraines. I know because I have migraines and FMS pain both. One pain management specialist I saw was a former neurosurgeon and was honest enough to tell me he didn<APO>t know anything about migraines when I asked him about how to treat mine. Addiction is different from dependence, you need to learn about both. Addiction is a psychological illness, and dependence is not. Fentanyl can be addictive and also causes dependence, many drugs do both, some only cause dependence. Take care, Annette""If you had such a dramatic improvement after stopping the Lyrica, then I would not take it again. Try something else, after discussing it with your doctor and pharmacist. Take care, Annette""Most of you know that I have a personal rule against using any drugs until they have been widely prescribed for at least five years, for the same reasons as you. I however, have been lucky in that my pcp respects that rule, and works with me. I am glad you found a better neuro for you. Take care, Annette""I think the best thing is to discuss this with a OB-GYN that you trust. All medicines taken during pregnancy or shortly before pregnancy have the potential to cause problems for the baby, but you must balance the possible benefits to you with the possible risks to the baby. There are pregnancy risk factors that are figured out for all medicines, they go A, B, C, D, and X. Drugs in the A category are the safest, and those in the X category should never be used by pregnant women. B, C, and D must be decided upon by the individual and her doctor. Suboxone falls in the C category, as does Lortab according to my drug handbook. Plain over-the-counter acetaminophen is in the B category. That is the only med that most doctors say is safe during pregnancy. Talk to your doctor. If you need stronger pain meds during your pregnancy, perhaps you need a high risk OB doctor??? Take care, Annette""I would explore seeing a different doctor at a different PM clinic or see your pcp and ask him to treat you. You did not mention your age or where exactly the pain is located, if you have other symptoms, what other meds you take, etc. I doubt that anything will ""solve"" the problem, but there are many kinds of meds that might help somewhat. If any of the treatments you have already tried drop your pain levels even a little bit, they may well be worth doing. A combination of several treatments that each help a little bit equals a worthwhile amount of relief. Take care, Annette""I really believe that one should see a doctor for any new or different kind of pain, you health and life is too important to use a message board for diagnosis. Take care, Annette""Take them as prescribed and see your own primary care doctor as soon as you can get in to see him, preferably this week. If needed he can prescribe whatever meds he believes you need. Take care, Annette""It may well be that you have partial seizures and also have a back problem, or the back pain may lower your seizure threshold, the thing is we are all just guessing. You need to see the neurologist and find out if they are related and/or if you just need to treat both of them separately. You may never know for certain if they are related or not. I don<APO>t know how ESIs effect partial seizure activity, that would be one of your questions for the neurologist. I would make a written list of questions for him. Keep in touch. Take care, Annette""What has your doctor suggested you try already, what does he suggest you try next? Take care, Annette""Although I agree with some of your points, I take exception to the one that said it was the doctor<APO>s own fault if he prescribed pain meds to someone who he did not have ""data"" for, showing that they were in pain. There is no test to prove someone has pain that I am aware of, if you are aware of one, please put out a link or the name of the test, so I can research it. MRIs and other scans will show structurally what is going on, but that does not prove someone has pain. Blood tests help a doctor make a diagnosis, but still do not show whether a patient in in pain or not. Fibromyalgia, one of the conditions that I have, still does not even have conclusive ""data"" to make a diagnosis with as far as blood tests or scans. I hope you are not saying that therefore I should not have pain meds? When I first got out of nursing school some people in the medical field still thought asthma was entirely an emotional issue, not a physical illness, that goodness they have been proven wrong. Addiction is a medical issue also, there are many ways of dealing with addiction. We do prescribe opioids to some addicts with our blessings, think methadone and Suboxone. Those folks are not happy either, they are sick. I do not have answers to all the questions discussed, just more questions. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t believe it is even possible for many of us to have no pain at all and still be functioning humans. That said, I thank God, or whoever, that I have the various meds available, in addition to other forms of treatment. Take care, Annette""I would vote for telling the doctor exactly what happened. I do not see why that would hinder him having surgery, but it would make him safer in the long run. Of course, you will be with him throughout this process, but do not let the surgeon operate without knowing ALL the details. To do his best, he must know everything that is going on with your husband. Take care, Annette""What does his surgeon say about his high blood pressure? Is it controlled with anything at this point? Many things can cause this kind of problem, I would not begin to try and guess what it is over the internet, or even in person, he needs to tell his doctors about this problem and see what they say, prior to having surgery. Take care, Annette""I had surgery last year and part of getting ready for it was to get a physical from my pcp. Of course, it included B/P. As long as your husband<APO>s B/P is controlled with the Norvasc, I do not see how that could have caused his episode. If he will not tell the surgeon, you do have the option of bring it to his attention yourself. Confidentiality laws prevent the doctor from giving out medical info, but they do not prevent you from telling him, and him from listening, or reading a letter. This is something you should discuss with your husband now, not later on. Take care, Annette""Please keep up on checking his blood pressure, at least once a week when he has stabilized on his meds. It is better to know before he has an incident. Please encourage him to discuss this with his surgeon also. Take care, Annette""Go see a doctor and get a medical evaluation. Let us know what he says. Take care, Annette""If you don<APO>t understand something, you need to ask questions. Interpreting an MRI must be done along with interpretation of other findings including a good history and physical. What symptoms you are having is very important. With those findings you may have no symptoms at all, or you may have some. Make another appt. and go in and sit down with the doctor and ask ALL your questions so you fully understand what your diagnosis is and what treatment options you have. Ask the doctor specifically what ALL your different treatment options are. Take care, Annette""The fact that your MRI is unchanged from the one you had in 2005 is a good thing. That means it is not progressing. ""Degenerative disc disease"" is often used interchangably with ""arthritis of the spine"", some doctors use one term and others use the other term, not precisely medically correct, but that is what they seem to do. I would go back to see him in person and let him know your meds aren<APO>t working well anymore. See what else he has to offer you. Take care, Annette""A therapist I used to see in another state gave me the name of a book, ""Feeling Good"", by Dr. David Burns, MD. I got a copy and read it cover to cover. He suggests using cognitive behavioral therapy techniques for depression, I found it is also very useful for chronic pain. I opted to pick out the techniques that I thought would be useful for me, of course, he recommends using the entire program. I have used no antidepressants for many years, and I do not let pain manage my life anymore. Another good book is ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"" by Dr. Margaret A. Caudill, MD, PhD. Both books are easy to find and fairly cheap, I doubt I paid more than $20 each for them. Might be a bit more nowadays. Take care, Annette""Ditto what she said. Take care, Annette""That all depends of the individual. I did prednisone the same way for my knee, but I have FMS, so I stretched out the times needed to recover. I also followed the prednisone with ibuprofen in high doses to maintain the anti-inflammatory response. I never had any MRIs, as I considered it a step towards surgery and I was not willing to consider that yet, my choice. The doctor offered them, both times. I would suggest you speak to your doctor about all of this. He would be the one to give you approximate time lines for recovery. Take care, Annette""Take the poll: Are you still dealing with haters? How about ""NO, I never have had to deal with haters""? I do not have the same experiences that you have had, I am sorry that this has become your reality, but it is not mine. My family and friends have continued to treat me as well as they did prior to my illness. Any family problems we have are totally unrelated to my chronic pain. Take care, Annette""When I needed around the clock medication, my doctor suggested the Duragesic Patch as one alternative. I explained to her that I used my hot tub every day and it was the only thing that gave me complete relief, and so she told me that the patch was not the best option for me and put me on oral meds instead. I would tell your doctor that the maker of the Butrans told you it may not be the best choice for your life style, so you would prefer to stay on the old medicine or try a different oral med. I do not know medically why he is switching folks to Butrans if they are happy with what they are already on. He may have his own agenda. If so you may be forced to deal with it. Good luck. Take care, Annette""Thank you so much for your post. I have been using methadone for about two years now because it is so cheap. I requested it from my doctor for that reason because I am terrified of the dreaded donut hole in Medicare part D insurance. I did check with a pain management specialist, and although he suggested a yearly EKG, he felt at the doses I was using the QT interval prolongation was unlikely to happen. I have read articles that say it is dose related and one or two that said it was not dose related. I feel very fortunate that it has worked out so well for me, but I do worry about long term consequences. Many of us truly use ""long term"" medicines in that we may take them for many years. I am aware that most drugs are tested for ""long term"" safety for only one year. Older drugs my have never been tested properly. I realize that drugs like these should only be used as a last resort for chronic pain, after one tries the other treatments. Thanks again for your post. Take care, Annette""I would really appreciate a short post on methadone and how dangerous it can be if taken incorrectly, and how good it can be if used correctly for chronic pain. The basic pros and cons. There are more and more of us taking this cheap medication for pain, having previous professional experience, I am very careful to use it properly. I am also aware of the deaths caused by the misuse of this drug. I am afraid of people using it like they used other opioids and dying. Thank you, Annette""If they test for methadone it will probably turn up positive. Taking an old dose of methadone can be very dangerous once you don<APO>t have a tolerance from taking it daily. You could easily stop breathing. Not a good idea. Take care, Annette""I will keep good thoughts for you on Thursday. As a nurse, you know that any kind of surgery has risks, even minor stuff. People forget that with our knowledge comes bad as well as good. All you can do is be prepared, and have your family there to look out for you. I know you already know that. Hugs, Annette""It is Friday night, how are you doing? I was not on line yesterday at all, but I was thinking of you. Hugs, Annette""I am still thinking about you, hope all is going well. Hugs, Annette""When I went on long acting opiates, I opted not to even try the Oxycontin as it had no generics at that time. I used a generic MS Contin and a generic Norco for break through pain. I stayed with this for over ten years, adjusting the dose as necessary. 1-I suspect your doctor is just trying to avoid hassle by not prescribing Oxycodone in either short or long acting form. It seems to be the drug of choice to abuse where you live. I suspect that the drug abusers will just adjust to whatever is prescribed in your area eventually. 2-I have used generic MS contin and found it worked fine, ditto with generic Norco, and generic oxycodone IR for breakthrough pain. I currently use methadone and it works fine and is VERY cheap. I have never used Opana ER or Oxycontin. 3-All insurance companies are different, and can even vary from policy to policy in the same company. Generics are tested by the FDA and they must contain exactly the same amount of active drug, and work in the same way and in the same time frame as brand name drugs. I have never had a problem with them. I believe that one should be able to obtain the brand name drugs as long as one is willing to pay the difference in cost. That is just my personal opinion. 3(?)-Not sure what you are asking, but i have already covered what I have used and how it works. 4-I don<APO>t use any opioid patches because I like my hot tub too much for them to be safe. Oral is fine with me. Take care, Annette""There is always the adjustment period that Peskypain mentioned at the end of the post. Give the doctor and the new drug time to work. The dose may well need to be adjusted a few times after the switchover to find the best one for you. Take care, Annette""My late Auntie Inga played piano every day for her entire adult life. She said that it kept the arthritis at bay in her hands. I would say do it and see what happens. You may not play as well as before or you may play better due to practicing. Who really cares? The point is you should do what feels good to you. Take care, Annette""It has never happened to me, but I would not suggest taking a benzo such as Ativan in addition to opiates. I do not think the two families of drugs should ever be taken at the same time. I vote that your pain gets treated with whatever meds are appropriate. Take care, Annette""I looked for evidence based research on prolotherapy a couple of years ago and found none. I won<APO>t try anything without sound double blind therapy to back it up. Take care, Annette""I totally understand what you are saying. It is hard to imagine someone refusing pain meds if they are truly in pain. However, I have not only met such people, I used to be one. Some people are misinformed about addiction and are so afraid of becoming addicted, they simply will not use opiates. Some elderly people have grown up in an era where they believed that pain was part of growing older, and assume it is just part of life. Some of us are just plain stubborn, lol. This would include me and my husband. I used to work 12 hour shifts in the ER and cry all the way home in the car because my legs hurt so bad, then wash my face and try to sleep. I would not cry in front of my husband or child. I would occasionally take a vicodin on my days off, but hated myself for giving in. When I finally could no longer work, my best RN friend at work told me that she hoped I would now start taking pain meds the way I taught my patients to. I always told my patients to take their meds before the pain got bad, not to ""chase the pain"". But I never did it myself, until after I stopped working. Now, I do take them properly. My husband had AVN of the hip for a couple of years, undiagnosed at the time. He was not only walking, albeit with a cane, he was still working full time as a big truck mechanic. He took nothing but ibuprofen. He would holler out in pain when he turned over in bed, waking me up. I finally insisted his doctor xray and evaluate his hip. The xrays showed the ball of his femur (thigh bone) was completely collapsed. The doctor said he had never seen anyone who could even walk on a hip like that. My husband described his pain as a 2 on the 0-10 scale when the doctor explained it to him. I had to explain my husband<APO>s Zen attitude about pain to the doctor, he felt if he admitted it was a 9-10 then he would have to really feel it that way. But, as long as he could minimize it verbally, it didn<APO>t feel as bad. My hubby went onto endocet and later to methadone and endocet until he had surgery to fix the hip. Then he tapered off without any withdrawal symptoms. Whether or not to take pain meds is a very personal decision. I respect anyone<APO>s decision as long as they have all the information to make an informed one. For me, heck yes, I am going to take pain meds, but if someone else doesn<APO>t want to, that is their decision. I will try and find them other options and information. For me, it is frustrating when someone refuses to try anything and just complains all the time. I try and ignore those posts. But, refusing to try opiates does not get the same kind of rise out of me. Take care, Annette""I agree that you should take meds as prescribed by the doctor who wrote the prescription. If you have old pills left over or that you got some other way, I recommend checking with your current doctor who is prescribing your pain meds. Suboxone is used for pain as well as opioid dependence, so I do not understand when you say it is not necessary, but you still want to take the other pain meds??? The rules about doctors prescribing Schedule II drugs change from practice to practice and from state to state although they are required to stick with federal minimum standards. I would check with the state medical board at your state. I have found mine to be very helpful and very kind. Take care, Annette""You need to talk to your doctor about all of this stuff. My doctors never suggested breast reduction surgery to me, it was only when I brought it up that we actually talked about the pros and cons. I had breast reduction surgery almost a year ago, and I am thrilled with the results, including less pain in my back, shoulders, and neck. I was 61, wish I had had it done many years ago. I have been on long acting opiates for many years, and continue to take them, but I take less now than I did before the surgery. It is all up to you and your doctor, surgery worked for me, it may not be the right choice for you. But, at least have the information to add to whatever else you learn. Take care, Annette""I didn<APO>t have the surgery until I was 61 years old. My surgeon did not promise a cup size but after all the swelling went away, I went down to a C cup which is what I asked her for. Medicare paid for most of my bills without any hassle at all. It was pre-approved before I ever had the surgery as long as the doctor removed a certain amount of tissue, which she did. She had no doubt that they would pay for it from the beginning. Times have changed. Meds aren<APO>t the end of the world, I have been on them for over 15 years now. Take care, Annette""Great description, but I am sorry we cannot diagnose you on line, no one can. I would just talk to your doctor, tell him how the pain affects your everyday life, what it prevents you from doing, and that you want treatment of some kind to make you feel more up to life in general. Take care, Annette""Go slow when you have not been exercising regularly. Work up to your previous routine slowly. Take care, Annette""If you no longer need the pain meds, then by all means taper off of them. I think when you see the pain management doc you should discuss this with him. If you do still need the meds, then stay on them. Make sure they monitor your liver since you do take the percocet with the tylenol in it. It is best to take less than 4,000 mg. of tylenol per day long term according to the tylenol label. I would take less than 2,000 mg. a day though, the most recent medical research leans to the lesser amount. A simple blood test can monitor your liver function. Take care, Annette""Clonodine is the drug they use to help with withdrawal symptoms if you need it. Take care, Annette""Sometimes there is no obvious reason for migraines. I just have them, I had a C5-6 discectomy for other reasons and it made no difference for my migraines. I don<APO>t really think most migraines are related to spinal disc problems. I have never met anyone who were cured of their migraines after disc surgery. It is entirely possible that you would have developed migraines even if you were not in the car accident. At any rate, it was so long ago that I am not sure it matters. I would stop looking for the cause of the migraines and focus on treatment. You did not mention any oral medicines for migraines, just injections, epidurals, etc. It takes years and a lot of patience to develop a treatment plan for migraines that works. You go through all the oral preventative meds, then you go through them all again in pairs. Each drug or drug combo is generally used for 8 weeks each for optimum relief. In addition to this preventative plan, one also tries various rescue meds to take when one has a migraine. It took me years of trial and error, and going through menopause (that helped) to get a handle on my migraines. I would go to a headache clinic or doctor, rather than a pain management specialist. I have been to three PM doctors over the years for other types of pain, none of them knew anything about migraines, and told me immediately that they were not trained in that area. I saw a neurologist who specialized in migraines at UC San Francisco, he was great. No cure, but at least we knew my doctor was on the right track. Take care, Annette""If you can<APO>t afford to see a doctor about this, all I can suggest is that you go to a free/low cost clinic in your area. Find one by doing a search on line putting ""Free clinic in (your area)"" in the search engine. How can you expect people on line to be able to make a diagnosis based on a bit of a history and no examination at all? It cannot be done. Take care, Annette""My first thought was that the lab tested a different urine sample that was not yours. Where the urine sample got mixed up is another question, it could have happened at the doctors office or the lab itself, who knows. It is good that your pain management doctor knows you well enough that this is not a problem. Take care, Annette""I am confused, who fired who? Did your PM doc let you go or did you let him go? I am also confused in that you state in this thread that NO one has access to your drugs but you, they are kept in a locked safe. But in another thread you state that your wife secretly ""quaranteened"" them and that is why you did not have the amount you should have had? I may or may not agree with your letter, but I hope you find peace and can control your pain adequately without the meds mentioned. Take care, Annette""How much of a disability rating did you receive from the VA? Can you get care at a VA facility? My son has a 90% disability rating from his Marine enlistments, but he is able to work full time as long as he continues to pass his physical exams for his job, as soon as he fails one his rating will go up to 100%. If you have no other options, I would do a search on your computer for free/low cost clinics in your area. Take care, Annette""Thank all of you vets for your service. I should have said that in my first reply to the original poster. I apologize. In my experience as a nurse, different VA hospitals have vastly different reputations in the community. VA hospitals in some cities stink, and in others they have stellar reputation. I currently live outside Portland, OR and the one in Portland has a great reputation, and I have met doctors that work there that are wonderful, caring guys. I have also lived in Reno, Nevada and near SF, Calif. where they are known as hell holes and no one would go there if they didn<APO>t have to. My son was a Marine and he has found the same thing to be true. I might also say that some communities do not have any VA medical services available. Take care, Annette""Medicaid depends on your income in most states, all of them probably, but I don<APO>t know for certain. I am on SSDI and do not qualify for Medicaid in my state. It depends on what her income is. My son get too much $$ from the military for his disability to qualify for Medicaid in my state also. Thank goodness he is still able to work and gets his medical insurance from them. Both suggestions are well worth looking into though. Take care, Annette""You may also have the type of pain or be genetically the kind of person that is not helped by opioid type medication. If after ""about 2 years"" you can take ""10 Dilaudid"" and feel no relief at all, and you have truly tried them all except fentanyl, opioids may not be the kind of drug that will help you. Take care, Annette""What kind of drug test did you have? Did they test for Valium and hydrocodone? I would ask the doctor to call the lab involved and discuss this all with them. They may have had others report the same thing. I have personally never heard of soy milk causing a problem with drug tests. Take care, Annette""How often do you sneeze? What percentage of the times that you do sneeze do you have the pain in your joints? How long does the pain last? I would discuss this with my doctor. Take care, Annette""I would speak to my doctor and let him know about this the next time I saw him. It does not sound like such a severe problem that I would make a special appt. just for this reason. That is me, you need to do what you feel is best for you. Take care, Annette""Legally, yes, a doctor is responsible for the RXs he writes and is able to decide what he will write for. Morally is another thing. If this is the only time you have looked for a new doctor you will not be labeled a ""drug seeker"" or a doctor shopper. You were on a drug regimen that worked for you, and your doctor left the clinic you were in, not your fault. Are you able to simply follow your doctor to his new practice? I have followed mine from a group practice to a solo practice in another town, to another group practice. Luckily, my insurance allowed this. Will yours? If not I would sit down with the doctor and talk this over and if that doesn<APO>t help, find another doctor. Take care, Annette""Your doctors are doing the correct things so far. NSAIDs and PT are where one starts out. I would go back to the pcp and tell him what the other doctor said and ask for further evaluation and treatment. The fact that you have had blood work that shows inflammation somewhere, and that your knees are also hurting will give the primary doc more information to make a diagnosis from. He may make a diagnosis on his own, or he may send you to a rheumatologist or another type of specialist. My primary doc has managed my pain for 12 years or more, she sends me to a specialist as needed for diagnostic stuff, but she does treat my pain with opioids. I think whether or not you see a pain management specialist or your regular doc depends more on the doctors<APO> preferences than anything else. The DEA and FDA do not keep her from prescribing strong meds. What kind of ""possible allergic reaction"" did you have? Take care, Annette""When all this acute stuff is over, you might consider seeing an allergist for allergy testing, giving up all NSAIDs forever is a tough thing to do. Take care, Annette""Prednisone does seem like a miracle drug because you do feel so much better so quickly. It is a powerful steroidal anti-inflammatory. However, long term use carries significant risk of diabetes, avascular necrosis, eye problems, etc., etc. These are not a problem when you use this drug for a week or two, a couple of times a year, but please do not use it for months at a time, unless you have no other choice and are carefully monitored by an MD. Take care, Annette""Just ask, be honest and reasonable. If you treat the pain meds just like you would any other med for any other problem, he probably will too. Rather than say you need more pain relief, you might tell him what kids of activities you must forego due to your pain that you would like to be able to do. Some doctors are more able to deal with function rather than just pain relief. If you don<APO>t tell him you need more, then each time you see him, he assumes that you are doing okay?? Take care, Annette""It is finally up to you if you decide to see him or not, or let him do injections or not... Get copies of all your medical records and decide what to do. Take care, Annette""Best of luck to you. You have a hard decision to make, but you have all the information you need to make it. Maybe you should move away if possible??? Take care, Annette""Report him to Medicare, list all your concerns and see what they say. Take care, Annette""As a licensed, although not working, RN, I would also do anything legal to keep my license. It was how I got a job and paid my bills for many, many years. A specialist MD has at the least 12 years of schooling, and education costs invested in his MD license, far more than a nurse. Both when I gave drug tests, and when I have taken them as a patient or employee, the person giving the test always asked when my last dose of medicine was and how muck I took. That is required when one fills out the form that comes to send in with the urine sample. One way to make sure you take exactly what is prescribed is to write down the date, time and dose each time you take a dose. I use a simple check off chart, and save the charts in a folder, at least for several months. I also count my pills once a week when I fill my weekly pill box. Another safe guard. Everyone develops their own system. Best of luck, I hope things work out for you. Take care, Annette""I assume you are talking about fentanyl patches??? There is a low dose patch, as they come in many doses. If you are already on long acting opiates and are changed over to a very low dose you should not feel ""drugged"". It might be better to start them on a Friday or whatever is the start of your weekend, let a close friend or family member that lives with you know you are starting on a new med so they can be aware of side effects for you. Can you drive legally, or would you be capable of driving? Driving legally depends on what state you live in, but you should already be on a significant dose of oral opioids if you are considering starting on fentanyl patches. If your state allows one to drive on one kind of opioid, they will allow driving on any opioids as long as you are not impaired. (If you are NOT on any opioids, you should not start on the patches, it is dangerous and contraindicated by the drug company that makes them.) I would wait a week or so after starting any new drug, and see how you respond to them before getting behind the wheel, you do not want to hurt yourself or anyone else. Take care, Annette""In future, it might be better to name the type of patch you are talking about. Fentanyl was the first pain patch, but now there is Lidoderm, and also Butrans. Take care, Annette""I personally believe that the dose of whatever opiate you are on is more relevant that which opiate you take. I have not yet seen any studies that show one opiate is better than another in good head to head trials. You also need to not expect to be completely pain free, that is a losing battle. Most people with chronic pain need to realize that having some pain will end up being the new normal. Anyhow, I don<APO>t know you well enough to know how you personally deal with all of this, so please remember that this info is addressed to you, but is also put out there for anyone else who reads this. Take care, Annette""Pain Management treats pain, not the cause of it. My uncle had Shingles for five years, then no more outbreaks. Shingles is due to the Chickenpox virus going dormant in the nerves, and then cuts loose occasionally and causes Shingles. Some folks are lucky and never get it, others may get it once, others suffer it over and over again, or continuously for a long time. Some folks have residual pain otherwise called post-Herpetic Neuralgia. Taking anti-virals may shorten the course of Shingles. I am unaware of anything that ""cures"" it. The Chickenpox virus remains in your nerve tissue so it could cause an outbreak again. Not a whole lot of years ago we did not have anti-viral medications, and doctors tried other things to help their patients get rid of Shingles. I would speak to your doctor in person to ask him what is new in Shingles treatment, if he does not know, seek out a doctor who does. Take care, Annette""Strange, I have been taking it for years, and am losing about a pound a month now. My weight was stable for about ten years on neurontin. I don<APO>t attribute my weight variance to this drug. I am currently near my lowest weight in adulthood. Everyone is different in how they respond to meds. Take care, Annette""This is probably something you need to see your doctor about. Getting it examined and possibly xrayed can get you a definitive diagnosis that no one can give you on line. There is a life without heels. I am a 61 year old lady who has never owned a pair of heels. A podiatrist came to my nursing school class many years ago, and brought a model of a foot/ankle skeleton of a woman who wore heels all her adult life. Ugly enough for me to not ever wear them. I hate to think the pain they caused. I understand how pretty they make a woman look, but at least give your foot time to heal properly, before you go there again. Take care, Annette""Be louder in the reception area if necessary to get helped. I remember my husband telling a receptionist once that he was a Viet Nam vet (true) and he was going to have an ""episode"" if they did not help him right away. They did, but he had never had any ""episodes"" anyway. I always give a doctor the benefit of the doubt the first time I am kept waiting longer than 15 minutes, after that I ask the reception staff if that is a normal period to wait. Usually, the doctor is the one who sets the pace for the practice, but if he is unresponsive when you complain, find a new doctor. Your time is valuable too. Take care, Annette""Please follow up with an orthopedic surgeon that you feel good about, perhaps you can get suggestions from your friends or family. If you are being seen by ERs and Urgent care doctors, at this point you are being seen by the wrong type of doctors and too many of them. You need an orthopedic doctor and the same one every time, not different ones. Take care, Annette""I have to admit that I feel high heels now, are kind of like ""bound feet"" in old time China. ""Pretty"" is in the eyes of the beholder, usually men, and changes from day to day, year to year. I admit to thinking women look taller (of course) in heels, my self proclaimed short (5 foot, 1 or 2 inches) mother wore them daily for years to look taller. She even did housework in heels, and she was not Donna Reed. When she stopped, it took her several years of wearing shorter and shorter heels until she could wear flat shoes all day, due to shortened tendons and muscles in the backs of her legs. Her legs hurt her until everything stretched out again. Take care, Annette""Hang in there with the ankle pain, it should get better slowly but surely. If not get it checked out with your regular doctor. Regarding the high heels, it is a discussion worth having for others, if not for you. Thanks for the opportunity! Take care, Annette""It sounds like you need a new doctor, at least if that is the normal wait time in her office. I hope you told them loudly why you were leaving and got your $$ back. This happened to me once at a dermatologist<APO>s office after I had requested the first appt. of the day to avoid waiting. After 30-45 minutes, I went back to the receptionists<APO> desk and asked for my copay back and asked if this was the norm in that office. She was very embarrassed and said yes. I also reported them to my insurance company and the pcp who had sent me there. My current pcp of nearly 14 years has only had me wait longer than 15 minutes once. I won<APO>t tolerate that whole attitude that they have you held captive in the waiting room. Try and find a pcp who values you as a patient, and appreciates that your time is valuable to you. They do exist. Vent anytime. Take care, Annette""It might depend on what your pain condition is to begin with. It makes sense with some conditions that a hydrocodone pill would help in the morning when you have had all night to rest, but not in the evening when you have been up all day, causing more pain. I would assume that your pain levels vary, so taking a pain pill may be enough sometimes and sometimes not. I would suggest you keep a chart regarding your pain scores and the times you take your pain pill, and other meds, your activity levels, etc. and take it to your doctor and have this discussion with him. Yes, I have experienced this also, both with this med and stronger ones. Take care, Annette""Well said, I agree with your doctor, never wait until the pain is really bad to take your meds, take them at the first sign of pain. I also agree with you about neurontin and Lyrica, they came out with Lyrica around the same time neurontin went generic. The drug companies like to make the big bucks off of new drugs. Take care, Annette""I have always taken whatever generic is available, and never found any difference at all, either between the generics or when compared with name brand meds. I would keep a journal as I mentioned before, doctors like to see a ""written as it happened"" journal, as it seems to be more accurate than memory is. Take it to your doctor when you have an appt. so he can take a look at it before deciding what meds to try next. I also have FMS and its pain can be totally random. I found neurontin to work better than Lyrica for me. Antidepressants are also used in pain management, and for FMS, and you may find them useful. Everyone is different. Take care, Annette""I have used both neurontin and Lyrica and found the first worked best for me. I also have bad side effects with antidepressants, mostly memory problems, I don<APO>t use them at all any more. We are all different, so you just have to keep trying stuff until you find what works best for you. Take care, Annette""Norco IS hydrocodone/apap, perhaps the dosage is different? Take care, Annette""Fibromyalgia can increase the sensation of pain, so that your DDD might cause slight/no discomfort for someone without FMS, whereas you might feel extreme pain from the same sensory input. I am a bit confused about you requiring someone to go with you when you drive your youngest son to his allergist, I would have them drive you both (if your son requires you to be present). I have found that it causes far less pain to be a passenger than it does to be a driver. There is far more muscle tension required to drive a car than to ride in one. I also have DDD and FMS. If your son is older and does not require you to be present, send him with the driver you have chosen. Just sign all necessary papers ahead of time. Take care, Annette""You must post an email address to exchange doctors<APO> names and contact info. I would not use your personal email address that you use for friends and family, you can get one from Yahoo or Hotmail for free to use for on line purposes. When was the last time a doctor saw your mom? If her thigh is getting worse at this stage of the game, I would be certain to tell her doctor that now. Sorry, I live in Oregon. Take care, Annette""Does her insurance require her to get a referral from her pcp? If she does need one, perhaps you could go with her to her pcp and ask him specifically for a referral. If not, just make an appt. yourself with the one that them most friends and family recommend. I personally trust my pcp to tell me if I need to see a specialist. Take care, Annette""It is common to find more as you go along. Some wrist fractures will not show at all in initial xrays, but do show after a week or so. Apparantly the same is true of ankle fractures, at least in your case. The splint can be scary for the patient, but it really is the best thing in my experience. Usually, the doctor tells you to stay off of it completely, having just a splint on it rather than a full cast keeps the patient honest. Will you have external fixators after surgery or will all the hardware be inside? Is a cast in your future? Let us know when your surgery is so we can all think positive thoughts for you, or pray, or whatever works for you and each of us. Take care, Annette""Please do not blame yourself for Ryan<APO>s death. A fatty emboli hitting the brain is very much like a stroke, except there are no ""clot busters"" for fatty emboli. Even if he were in the hospital with everyone watching him, he probably still would have died. It sounds like the ER release just stated the diagnosis in medicalese. Swelling, etc. is a normal expected part of having a fracture. He was with his family, that is very important to hold onto. It is probably the most important thing to him. Who would want their last memory to be of a hospital and strangers caring for him, rather than at home with his loved ones??? My Auntie Anna (my great-aunt) stroked due to a fatty emboli from a fracture at age 86, she was never the same person again, she lived in a nursing home speaking only Norwegian (her native tongue) for several years before she died, paralysed on one side. She had lived in a small apartment independently prior to the fracture. She had spoken English for over 70 years before it happened. There were no translators in those days, so essentially she was alone most of the time. My Auntie Inga, her sister, was the only one left in the family who spoke Norwegian, she said Auntie Anna did not make any sense in Norwegian either. I wish we could have been there for Auntie Anna like she deserved when she passed away. She had good nurses and the convalescent hospital. I think we all wish for what did not happen to us, greener pastures, I guess. You did not let Ryan down at all, your love shines through everything you have written about him. Take care, Annette""It sounds like your Grandpa is getting decent care at his new home. Be sure he has cereal, sandwiches, etc. And go in at odd hours to check on him. My mom took care of both Auntie Anna, and Auntie Inga, and she was certain that her odd visiting hours made the staff more aware that the ladies had someone checking in on them. I am a retired RN and I believe the same thing. Take care of yourself, Nate. Annette""Yes, everything is fine out here. They were technically my great aunties also, they were my dad<APO>s aunts. Now you can fall out of bed... Annaliese is a beautiful name. I was named Annette after my mom<APO>s mother and her sister, both were Annettes. There is something cool about being named after a real person in your family, even if they were already deceased, like in my case. Only nurses talk so blithely about dead people after midnight, lol. Hugs, Annette""It sounds like they did the normal thing for an ER for a closed fracture of a tib/fib. I assume they did an Xray, and told you to keep it elevated, use ice on and off, etc. The reason they use a splint at the outset rather than a cast is because they expect some swelling to be a possibility, and that way you/they can loosen the ace bandage holding it on, if necessary. By the time you see the ortho doctor on Friday, he should be able to place a cast on it for you. He will be able to tell by the examination part of your visit. My great-aunt had a fatty emboli from a closed fracture cause a stroke, but that happened immediately, she was taken to a hospital from the scene of the accident by ambulance. Most later problems are with open fractures and are caused by infections. But, you were treated...so I am unsure what the question really is about... Take care, Annette""My condolences for your loss. I did the Google search and the ME said the cause of death was due to broken right leg ""sequelae"". That means that it was due to something happening due to the broken right leg, but he did not say what. He ruled the death accidental. I do not know if he did an open autopsy or not. He may have just relied on medical records, etc. It depends on the rules of his area. None of this really matters, your grandson has died for no reason. It is a tragedy for everyone concerned. Take care, Annette""Your appt. with the orthopedic doctor was yesterday, how did it go? Are you well? Do you feel like you were treated properly? Take care, Annette""I would just point to the parts that hurt when you see a doctor. I am confused by your description of where it hurts because your ulna is one of the two lower arm bones, we all know where your shoulder blade (scapula) is, does your humerus hurt at all? That is the one bone in your upper arm. Please see your primary care doctor or a physiatrist. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t use antidepressants, they make things worse for me, especially my memory. I haven<APO>t taken them for many years. My doctor did try me on them for my FMS and later for depression when I could not work any longer. I decided to get off of them and see a good therapist. My doctor recommended one that he liked his patients to work with. I saw her for a few months, and when I moved away she gave me a great book, ""Feeling Good"", by Dr. David Burns, MD. It teaches you how to use cognitive behavioural therapy techniques to control depression and anxiety. It is a good read too. I read it and chose to pick out the techniques that I felt would help me. I cured my depression without drugs by using those techniques. The depression has never come back. You can also opt to use these techniques WITH medications if you so choose. Double blind medical studies have proven that CBT works at least as well as antidepressants and in some studies, better than antidepressants. SSD shrinks do not continue to see disability patients, they just do the initial evaluations for SSD. When I saw the one SSD sent me to I was nearly suicidal, I was thinking of dying all the time, and had made some plans on how to do it best. I was honest with him about all that, and he told me I was fine, I just needed to go back to work. I asked him straight out if I was one of his private patients would he tell me I didn<APO>t need to see him anymore? He just looked away and did not answer. I am a nurse, I KNEW I was in trouble, and he was ignoring that because SSDI pays his check. They are supposed to say we are all fine. If we need treatment, then SSD might have to approve our claims. He was an idiot,a nd I am so glad I had already found the way that ended up working for me. I do agree that making plans for the future IS important for all of us, but I know from experience that it is hard to do that while you are going through the SSDI process. Unless you are rich enough to not need the financial help, the finances seem to dominate your thinking. I believe that doing some kind of volunteer work when you can no longer work is important. It helps you get out of your own small world and help others, good for them and good for you. We can all do something, even if we are stuck at home there are programs where you can call other shut ins and check in on them. If you can get out of the house at all, the schools need tutors to read to kids, food banks need help, etc. Take care of yourself. Annette""Tell the doctor that wrote the RX for Nucynta that it is not helping you. You need to ask him what he would suggest. Take care, Annette""Suboxone is the drug in Butrans patches, from what I know. I do not understand why the PM doctor released you from her care. If you continued to test positive for marijuana after an appropriate cut off time, that might be the problem. It is good that the orthopedic surgeon is willing to take over your care. As far as I know he does not have any limitations on his prescription writing due to being a surgeon rather than a PM specialist. My internist has written my opioid prescriptions for well over 10 years now. She is not a PM specialist. You only need to be an MD or a DO, even a nurse practitioner can write for pain meds in some states. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""I personally do not trust anyone to take care of anything for me. Since they said they would fax it, they should have done so. Everyone sees prayer differently, if it helps you in any way, go for it. Did you get through the shower okay? Maybe God did help you... Take care, Annette""Thank you very much. Take care, Annette""You can request copies of your medical records from the doctor<APO>s office in writing. Be sure to include your full name and date of birth if you ask for them. You are allowed to put in your side of the story as an addendum, but you may not remove whatever she has written. This is a legal document, so I would write out your thoughts, and then give them 3-7 days and then edit them, wait again, edit again, then you might consider adding them to your record if you feel they would clarify the story. I would also look at the THC test done most recently, and see what the trend was at that time. I would not depend on the orthopedic surgeon to treat your pain, I would start looking for a PM doctor or a pcp who will consider managing it for you. Take care, Annette""I did not call you a liar, I just suggested what to do to get your records sent to you, and where to go from here...""I hope everything works out well for you. My husband was 6<APO>3"" and had lost weight down to 145 pounds when I met him. He was on chemo and radiation back then. Now it is 20 years later, he is fine and back to his normal weight. Monday is MLK Day, check and make sure your appt. is for Monday. It is a holiday here and everything is closed. Take care, Annette""How did things go? Take care, Annette""I always ask my doctor for a generic drug that has been widely prescribed for at least five years. I feel that this is the minimum time I am willing to accept. If my life depended on it, like a cancer drug, or something like that, I might use evidence based research and make a decision on a newer drug. Because we all respond differently to a drug, I may have no side effects, and you may have them all, or vice versa. You only know by trying them to see how well you respond to any drug. Take care, Annette""My left and right feet have always been difficult to fit in one pair of shoes as they are not the same size I had surgery on the left foot as a child. I am 61 years old now. My mom always put her thumbnail so there was one width of her nail between the end of my toes and the end of the shoe. I just read a day or two ago, that everyone should do that when fitting shoes. HOORAH, MOM!!! She also made sure there was enough room at the ball of the foot. I also suggest trying on shoes at the end of the day, when your feet are at their largest. I believe that the shoes should fit when you buy them, do not expect them to stretch enough to fit later on. I bought one pair of beautiful black boots that were a half size too small, but were on sale for only 10% of the original price. I took the all-leather boots to my cobbler and he stretched them for me, I could wear them for maybe an hour at a time, then had to change out of them. After a couple of years, they fit. I think I lost weight also, which matters. I would keep an extra pair of shoes handy, that you know fit properly and change them as needed. Always use your inserts when you try on shoes to buy. If you are going to be using them most of the time, use them when you try on shoes, like Mags suggested. I wear Birkenstocks out nearly all the time, and go barefoot at home. Shoes are in the corner by the front door... Take care, Annette""I feel that your original doctors and the ones you are seeing now have done you a severe disservice by not giving you this info verbally and in writing from the beginning. This would be true for any kind of treatment you receive for any health issues. I am glad you are seeking them out now, better late than never. I do not have an SCS so I cannot give you my opinions on them as a patient. Take care, Annette""Keep an open mind when you go see the plastic surgeon next week. The plastic surgeon who repaired my son<APO>s dog bite to his face, also did cosmetic procedures like implants and tummy tucks. He loved doing trauma reconstruction, but that often does not pay well, because many of the patients are uninsured. He did the strictly cosmetic surgery to pay the bills, so he could afford to do the reconstruction surgery for free for uninsured patients. Another option would be to look for an orthopedic surgeon who specializes in hands. I<APO>ve been an RN for 39 years and have found good hand surgeons in both of those specialties. I assume you are seeing an Infectious Disease specialist for the infection. My husband had a chronic, drug resistant, Staph infection and the ID docs and a good hospital based wound care clinic with advanced degree nurses helped get him cured. It has been over a year since he had any infection at all. He had his hip replaced last summer without any problem. His specialists all worked together, we made sure we got special permission from the insurance company so they would cover doctors who were not usually on their plan. It took a bit longer to do that paperwork, but because the insurance company wanted him to get well and stop spending their money, they were willing when it was all explained to them. His ID doctor and his vascular surgeon both needed special permission to take care of him. They worked with us to get that from the insurance company. I don<APO>t understand why your hand is not dressed properly, so dog hair can<APO>t get into it? An infected wound should be properly dressed. Take care, Annette""Tell the doctor that money is an issue since you will be buying the meds yourself without insurance. Usually, they give you all the RXs you might need ahead of time. Take care, Annette""I believe that high levels of acute pain might impede your ability to make good decisions during that moment, but chronic pain is different. I think one would need a lot more information to answer your question. Take care, Annette""Thanks for the link, I read the article. I do understand plasticity and neurogenesis, thanks for the easy definitions. I would ask you at what point do you trust studies as far as the number of participants in the study goes? When would you think perhaps we need to do more research, and when would you consider perhaps we have done enough and try using the results clinically? Thanks for writing a book about chronic pain, I have found many of them useful. Take care, Annette""Dr. A, I volunteered on a state committee to study opiates when used for chronic pain about ten years ago. For various reasons we found a dearth of good head to head studies of pain meds. We used a data base of evidence based studies done in English, and found very few good ones. We did the best we could, and commented in our report that much more study was needed. I totally agree that medicine is an art as well as a science. I have discovered while working as a nurse, that geography seemed to have a fair amount of effect on clinical practice. Some drugs were not used at all in one state, others were used instead. I had to do my own reading to keep up with all this too. I assumed that doctors affected each other as well as reading research studies. It was amazing when new doctors moved into town with new ideas. I hope we have many more discussions like this one. Take care, Annette""I think everyone who contributes to a discussion or even reads it and uses it in their own life makes a positive move. Part of the committee I was in included about 5 hours on how to evaluate medical studies by the number of participants, the length of the study, and who paid for it, for instance. It was a very informative class, I wish I had had more formal education in that area. Anyone who knows anything, please post!!! Take care, Annette""I am lucky, my doctor is willing to use opiates for chronic pain. I don<APO>t see any point in getting off of them and onto other, newer meds with worse side effects. I think some doctor believe in using them and others don<APO>t, but I do see some changes taking place over the last 15-20 years. It sounds like you are doing fine. Berg is a family name that many of the last couple of generations of my family used as a middle name, maybe we are distant relations, lol. Take care, Annette""I have had two EMGs, one was no big deal at all, the other was very painful. I think it is the practitioner doing them that matters. I had two different ones. Take care, Annette""I wonder what the amount of loss of cognitive function would be that would correspond with the 11% loss of brain volume. When I was a kid, it was said that we only used a small percentage of our brain cells, was that true? Since all folks lose brain volume with aging, but do not necessarily lose cognitive function, how important is all this? I do puzzles, exercise daily, read the paper every day. What else can one actually do to change the loss of cognitive function that MIGHT come with aging? Thanks for the link Bet, I will go there and see what she has to say. Dr. A, I would love to read any more info you might have on this. Take care, Annette""Is it a pill or in a liquid cough syrup? If it is for probation or parole reasons, you will have to clear it with the parole/probation officer first, before you take it. I would discuss it with the person requesting the test before you take the medicine, that seems the easiest thing to do. Take care, Annette""Get your doctor<APO>s opinion before starting any exercise, even walking if you haven<APO>t done it for awhile. I do agree with you though, I have been belly dancing at home in front of the TV for a couple of years now, and I have been slowly losing weight, and I do feel much better. I still have the same chronic pain issues, but over all, I do feel better. Take care, Annette""No, all these questions should be answered before you even schedule surgery. I had surgery last Jasuary and worked all the pain meds out with my current pcp (who managed my pain meds) and the surgeron ahead of time. The surgeon made sure I was covered properly in the hospital, and after I went home for a couple of weeks. Then my pcp took over once again and managed things for me. It went very smoothly. Take care, Annette""Sorry for the typos. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I am a nurse, and managing pain is one of the top priorities in a post operative unit. If your pain was not managed correctly, you did not in fact get good care. It sounds to me like you were not cared for properly. Your pain should never have been allowed to get to a ten to begin with. I would discuss this with the director of nurses (also send your concerns in writing), and with your surgeon. Let him know that you are really considering your options due to the lack of adequate pain control this last time. Be an adult, don<APO>t cry, but please do let them know how you were treated and not treated. It is good to start any discussion with a positive thing, but do not be shy about talking about the untreated pain. Take care, Annette""I found soaking in a hot tub or hot bath helpful. I never found a single drug that helped on its own, but a combination of zolpidem and neurontin helped significantly for me. I did not find clonazepam useful at all. When I stopped taking it, I had to have medical treatment for the withdrawals. I was only taking 0.5 mg each night, not a lot in each dose or in frequency. I will no longer take benzos for anything at all. Just me, they may work differently for different people. Take care, Annette""Why does he think you need an inpatient pain clinic as opposed to an outpatient one? I am never against a second opinion or a re-evaluation, I just do not get the inpatient part. Take care, Annette""I am so sorry to hear about your sister. I hope she is resting comfortably and has all her friends/family around to love her. Hugs, Annette""Oral syringes are just syringes with a different kind of tip on them so you can<APO>t hook them up to an IV or a needle and give the drug the wrong way. They are calibrated the same way for precise dosing. When you ""swish and swallow"" liquid meds, the first part of the dose is absorbed almost immediately through the mucous membranes of the mouth so you get a quicker onset of action, almost as fast as an IV. Then the rest is swallowed and that part works more slowly and lasts longer. The dose of methadone would depend on her level of pain, and previous use of opioids. If she hasn<APO>t developed tolerance yet, then 5 mg. may work just fine. If it isn<APO>t enough to control her pain, the nurses or doctors will increase the dose. With methadone you start low and increase very slowly due to the way it works and its long half life. It sounds like the morphine is the drug they are using for breakthrough pain. Morphine and oxycodone for long acting use aren<APO>t available in liquid form. That may be why they are using methadone liquid for her long acting med. People are able to use liquid meds without choking long after they become unable to swallow pills. My husband used methadone for about two years for his chronic hip pain before his replacement surgery. It worked well. Once he got to the dose that worked for him, he was able to stay at that dose for the whole time without increasing it at all. After his surgery, he just tapered off without any withdrawal symptoms. I think it is an excellent pain management drug when prescribed properly. Of course, all patients tolerate different meds differently. My best to you and your family. Take care, Annette""In my experience all opioids are pretty much the same, I feel any difference is dose related. I take methadone for a long acting drug and oxycodone for breakthrough pain. Hydrocodone worked fine but I was tired of taking all the acetaminophen along with it. I have noted no mental strangeness with the oxycodone, it helps some with my pain, as it should. Of course, there are abusers, as there will be when the hydrocodone is widely marketed without any added acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Dilaudid is widely abused when folks can get it. It is just the flip side of the coin, any opioid drug that helps with pain will have the potential of being abused, until they come up with some that do not have any euphoric effects at all. The sad thing is that most abusers are just looking to stay ""normal"" after a few weeks or months, they just do not want to go into withdrawal. Addiction is a sad and pathetic illness. Take care, Annette PS - Darvocet has been withdrawn from the market for awhile now.""Dilaudid is much stronger than Vicodin, it is just that for whatever reason doctors do not use it as often, so it isn<APO>t out there to be abused. Back when I worked in the ER, people would come in and say that the only drug that works for them was Dilaudid, these folks were 18-9 years old. Many of them were addicts looking for drugs. I think one has to separate the two problems, addiction and pain management. Doctors must be aware and they have to be able to trust their patients not to divert the drugs to street use. Unfortunately, there is no test to check for chronic pain, so a patient and a doctor must have a trusting relationship. I am so glad I have chronic pain rather than addiction as my health issue. I have worked in addiction treatment as a RN and the successful treatment percentage is very low. I have a triad of health problems causing my pain, Fibromyalgia, degenerative disc disease in my neck, and migraines. The FMS makes the pain from the others much more difficult to control. Take care, Annette""My husband used Cymbalta for several years and found it useful. I hope it works for you. Everyone responds to meds differently. Take care, Annette""Everyone has their own meds, prescribed by their own doctor. I personally refuse to take any kind of ""upper"", my choice. I am glad you have found what seems to work for you. Take care, Annette""I looked up this drug and it is a dexamphetamine, used on label for ADHD. I am glad to hear you do not have side effects, but lots of people do. Take care, Annette""It is tough to get rid of sinus infections, antibiotics just have a hard time getting to the infection. It often takes several weeks of antibiotics to get rid of the infection. I hope you feel better soon. Maybe now that you know what you are dealing with, things will get better. Take care, Annette""Hi, Bet I would also check your Vit. B12 level before making any decision about taking stimulants. I personally opt to avoid them, but we all have to decide for ourselves what to do in this regard. One problem I see with stimulants of any kind, is that they may interfere with sleeping properly, which I find very important in managing pain. The other problem is I remember when valium was the number one drug sold in the entire world, shortly after that came amphetamines. They were sold as a way to sharpen ones mind and get an edge on the rest of the folks. They also counteracted the side effects of the valium. They did not believe that amphetamines were addictive or dangerous back then (in the late 60s, early 70s). I also remember the junkies that switched from opiates like heroin to amphetamines, bad news. I do know that the latest stimulants are not amphetamines, but I will wait awhile and see where this path takes us, before I try them. I have already read about Ritalin and other ADHD meds being abused in the same way amphetamines were on college campuses back in the day. Take good care of yourself meanwhile, I know you will decide carefully with your doctor what to do. Hugs, Annette""What does your doctor say? Take care, Annette""Talk to the doctor who gave you the injections, ask him if this is normal or if you have another problem entirely. Take care, Annette""Best of luck to you, I will keep my fingers crossed on the 25th for you. Often as a nurse, I have seen folks learn to favor one joint to the detriment of other joints. I hope this surgery helps all the pain in all your joints. Have they suggested any PT for gait retraining? I found menopause helped with my migraines... Take care, Annette""How did it go? How are you feeling? Take care, Annette""Were you intubated? That would account for the sore throat. Write down all your concerns and discuss them with the doctor in person. I got lucky with the migraines, my doctor told me one third of folks with migraines get better after menopause, one third stay the same, and one third get worse. I guess it is a toss of the dice as to which way you go. Since my other pain conditions got worse with age, I guess God or Whoever was being kind to me. I hope you feel better soon. Take care, Annette""Well, that explains your sore throat at least. I hate migraines more than my usual pain, mainly because I hate vomiting more than anything, and that often comes along with the migraine. Whatever works, I would rather my brain focus on my other aches and pains than on migraines. Take care, I hope you feel better soon. Annette""If you are questioning your own doctor, ask for a referral to a specialist (if you even need a referral). Get a second opinion. Take care, Annette""Sorry, but you have multiple injuries and are asking rather specific to you questions about scar tissue, etc. No one here has exactly the same injuries as you do, so I would suggest you see a physiatrist (physical action or sports doctor) for a second opinion. I bet your own doctor would be glad to have another set of eyes looking at this picture. Take care, Annette""Ditto, call your prescribing doctor and see what else is available. There are many kinds of opiates that can be used for chronic pain. Take care, Annette""I think Bet is talking about Charles, he is the one who often posts links to studies he has read regarding pain management, especially back pain as he has had that for many years. I agree with Bet, learn about addiction and dependence and tolerance, all of these are part of taking opiates, but addiction seldom happens in folks who use opiates for chronic pain. Morphine is the oldest opiate currently in use in the US. All other opiates are compared to it for effectiveness. It is no more addicting than the other meds like the oxycodone you started out on. Please keep posting as your experiences are as important as any ones. We all learn by reading others. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t drink alcohol at all, because I shouldn<APO>t drink with the meds I am taking. I have not found any foods that cause increases in my chronic pain. So my eating habits have remained pretty much unchanged in regard to my FMS and DDD. I went through the elimination diet for migaines many years ago and other than shell fish and wine, found nothing else that caused migraines for me. I stopped eating and drinking those things many years ago. One trip to the ER after eating prawns was enough. Neither were that big a deal to avoid. Take care, Annette""I take methadone, have for about 3 years now, I think. It is not any more dangerous than anything else you take. The only thing I could find on line when I researched it was that it could cause prolongation of the Q-T segment in your heart. I discussed this with a pain management doctor that I see every few years and he felt it was not an issue in my case, but told me it might be at higher doses, and getting a yearly EKG would probably put my mind at rest. So now I do that, so far, so good. I certainly do not worry about it. I also do not discuss my meds with anyone other than my MD. It is only her and my business. Some people are anti-opioids altogether, just the way they are. As far as making the decision to get off of methadone, it you switch to another opioid, it should be no big deal at all. Even if you decided to get off of all opioids, as long as you do it slowly, you should be fine as an out patient. My husband got off of methadone twice without any withdrawal at all, I slowly decreased his dose. Now he takes only over the counter meds for his pain, his choice. I took benzos for a short time, once a day at bedtime, and I had significant withdrawals when I stopped taking them. I required medical intervention, but at home not in the hospital. It was unpleasant, but not any worse than the flu. I won<APO>t take them again. My choice. Don<APO>t panic, do your own research, and decide for yourself what to do with your doctor<APO>s input. Take care, Annette""You should do just what your doctor tells you to do when he writes the RXs. You may not have any w/d symptoms at all, everyone is different. Go slowly, and be prepared for the worst, but hope for the best. I worked with heroin addicts at a treatment center in the 1970s and the older heroin addicts, who had been using for 20 years, told me that opioid withdrawal was like a bad case of the flu, bone aches, shivers, etc., but it only lasted a week or less. From what I saw, I tend to believe them. I also know we were able to taper clients off of methadone without any w/d symptoms at all if we did it very slowly. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Q-T prolongation does not generally cause an irregular heart beat or palpitations in my experience. You have a regular heart beat with a longer Q-T segment than normal. If the heart beat starts up during this time, bad things can happen, due to the heart tissue repolarizing electrically. A simple EKG test can show the doctor if you have this rarity or not. Discuss it with the prescribing doctor and ask for this simple test. Don<APO>t go by what you read on the internet, here or elsewhere, always discuss your concerns with a trusted doctor. Do your research, but discuss it with a doctor before making any decisions. Take care, Annette""You are absolutely correct!! I used Google to find studies about this before I started taking methadone. It is sometimes difficult for lay folk to read a study correctly though. Be sure and print out any studies and take them to your doctor so he can go over them with you. It is pretty amazing how some folks can write an article based on 25 people reacting a certain way. This may be grounds for doing more research, but it is rarely grounds for stopping a medicine prescribed by your doctor. No one is always right or always wrong, we are all human after all. Take care, Annette""I do not know of any connection between the two, but as my doctor has told me, I can always get something else in addition to my chronic problems, just like anyone else. Let your eye doctor check it out, do your own research too, so you are prepared to discuss it with him. How old are you? Our eyes change from time to time. I never needed even reading glasses until I was into my late 40s. Take care, Annette""Please go see a neurologist about this new and different pain you have recently encountered. Take care, Annette""If you are smoking Cannabis, that may be why the doctor dismissed you. Although, individual states have made laws about smoking pot, federal law says it is still illegal and that trumps state law. Take care, Annette""Best of luck with your new doctor. I hope everything works out for you. Take care, Annette""See your doctor, your pcp should be there for you. If he/she does not have the answer perhaps a referral is in order. Take care, Annette""Neuropathy simply means a nerve or more than one nerve is not working properly. It is more of a symptom than a diagnosis. Many different things can cause neuropathy, from injury, to diabetes, to a stroke. Neuropathy may only affect sensory nerves causing pain, burning, tingling, etc., or it could cause motor problems making it difficult to move, or it could cause both. It can be permanent or temporary. I have had both, the motor nerve problem was fixed with surgery, but I still have pain from neuropathy of sensory nerves. It is great that you are having such a good result from neurontin after only 4 days, it could improve much more. I have used neurontin for nearly ten years now and once I found the dose that was best for me, I left it alone. I have no side effects at all. It took several months to find that dose. I went up to 1800 mg. a day, and then back down to 800 mg. a day. I take ALL of mine at night rather than splitting up the dose during the day. You are not your grandma, and you will have different kinds of problems than she did as far as your health goes. She was very old when she developed her neuropathy. Go back to the doctor, do a lot of research, and stay active. Bed rest is not advised for back pain anymore. Once you find out more information you can discuss treatment options with your doctor or a neurologist. Take care, Annette""I agree with Bet, discuss this with your doctor. He needs to compare that report with his hands on exam of you, and your medical history to make an accurate diagnosis. Unfortunately, back pain is not consistent with herniated or bulging discs on MRIs. A very large study of 700-800 cases found that one can have a normal MRI as far as discs and the spine goes and have severe pain, or one can have severe disc herniations and bulging on the MRI and have no pain at all. Or anything in between. The end point of the study was that MRIs alone do not correspond with chronic pain of the back, and they are not an accurate way of diagnosing back pain. I do not have the link to that article, but perhaps Charles does. I read about it in my nursing journal several years ago and in an ""Arthritis Today"" magazine article about back pain about two years ago. Take care, Annette""I would sit down with the doctor who prescribed this medicine and discuss your concerns with him. I am also on methadone, but only a total of 20 mg. per day. I read up on the literature available, and found that the QT interval prolongation can happen with any dose per one study, and in several other studies 60 mg. a day seemed to be the limit for this rare side effect. I discussed it with a PM doctor during a consultation and he was not concerned at my dose, and said that I could have an EKG once a year if it made me feel better. I had been on it a year or so at that point and was having some surgery anyhow, so I had an EKG which was perfectly normal. I found no long term side effects as far as organs were concerned (liver, kidneys, heart), just this rare electrical booboo in the QT segment. Other meds also cause this problem, so I would be careful about mixing methadone with meds that also cause QT problems. Withdrawal symptoms should not be a problem if you taper off very slowly, but of course, the original pain may well come back. TALK to your doctor, let him know that you are anxious, and deal with it. I would NOT mix benzos (certain meds for anxiety) with the methadone, they are a bad mix. Cognitive therapy may also help with anxiety, it works well as long as you keep doing it. Good luck to you. Take care, Annette""Do you know what caused your peripheral neuropathy? Generally speaking, treating the cause is better at controlling this than just treating the pain. Either way, it is very difficult to treat. Take care, Annette""Thanks for the link, Dr. A. Take care, Annette""See your OB doctor right away of course. Take care, Annette""It is nice of you and typical of a parent to wish you could take the pain instead of her. Meanwhile, there are lots of good doctors out there, I would help her find one to replace the GP she has now if he doesn<APO>t take the time to help her deal with her issues. Why would she feel she is being discriminated against? Part of the process of dealing with an illness that is chronic rather than acute is dealing with the fact that she will have it for the long term. That she just has to work through, she is lucky to have you on her team while she does that. Take care, Annette""Ditto what she said, lol. See the neurologist, he will explain the CT scan to you. Take care, Annette""See a doctor promptly, many things in this area can be dealt with and your pain levels will go down. Take care, Annette""You should read the print-out given to you by the pharmacist every month along with your meds. Talk to your doctor about your concerns also. Personally, I have not heard of any long term organ problems related to opioids. I have read about methadone causing a prolonged QT segment in the electrical system of the heart, particularly at dosages over 60 mgs./day. I just Googled it and read the various articles. We had a discussion about that here over the last week or so. My PM specialist that I have seen as a consult told me not to worry, it was a rare side effect, and just get an EKG once a year so I don<APO>t worry about it. I have been on opioids for well over 15 years now, and my blood work is normal, as is my EKG. I consider the pain relief that I get to be very important compared to possible side effects in the future. Take care, Annette""You need to see your family doctor and get a proper examination. Don<APO>t worry about it, doctors and nurses have seen everything. You should do a self examination once a month of your testicles to check for testicular cancer. While you are at the doctor<APO>s office, ask the doctor to tell you how to do this. Take care, Annette""I would hope you do not give yourself ANY IM injections from here on out. You MUST rotate sites, there are plenty of sites available for injections that one can reach by ones self. It is fairly easy to get lumps in the muscles from repeated injections, besides being uncomfortable, they inhibit proper absorption of the medicine. I had them after being in the hospital for typhoid many years ago and getting multiple IM injections of antibiotics, they took years to go away completely. Oral pain meds work just as well as IM ones. Ask for something oral. Did your doctor observe you giving yourself an injection before he sent you off to do this? Some one in his office should have instructed you and watched you do at least one injection properly. Take care, Annette""You should be able to reach both your upper arms, maybe your upper/outer hips, and both thighs. You have to learn to give injections with either hand if you are going to continue this. At the very least you should be able to use both upper arms and both thighs. Do not always stick the needle in the same place, it may be easiest but it won<APO>t work out well in the long run. There are charts you can use to document where you give yourself injections so you remember the rotation sites. Toradol is a great drug, but it has limits on how long you can use it due to possible GI side effects. I think it is five days only. I am not certain how you are using it, or how often. The muscle will heal eventually, but it might take a year or so for the lumps to go away. Share this with your doctor please. Take care, Annette""The GI effects of NSAIDs are not due to swallowing them, but because they inhibit the formation of a chemical that protects your GI system, without this chemical GI damage is more probabe than if you have it. You are correct about the kidney effects of toradol, that was my error in not mentioning it. I do not know what the timing is, I just remember that you could not take the toradol pills for more than five days in a row. I do not know how long you must be off of it to do another round. Take care, Annette""How far down your legs does your pain go? Perhaps you should tell the doctor specifically what activities you are prevented from doing due to the pain rather than focusing on the CT scan results. A lack of function may get more of a response from the doctor than just bulging discs found on a CT scan. Take care, Annette""I think you should discuss this with your doctor or a health practitioner at your college health clinic. You will probably find out it is no big deal, but better safe than sorry. An adrenaline rush can cause brief symptoms, a tingling or perhaps pain, then as it subsides you may feel tired and lethargic. Take care, Annette""While William Hurwitz was still practicing (I visited his website after reading articles about how the DEA was picking on him), I was appalled by the way he ran his practice, per his own website. I agree that chronic pain patients may have a difficult time finding proper treatment, but I have a hard time thinking this doctor was helping people rather than lining his own wallet. Just my opinion. Take care, Annette""I find gabapentin works better for me than Lyrica, it is generic and far cheaper. Did you ask the doctor specifically for gabapentin? Some antidepressants are also used in chronic pain treatment and work for some patients. Did you ask the PM doctor who told you you would be better in 6-8 months why you were not better after 1 year? Speak up and ask questions, and sit and wait for answers. If the doctor doesn<APO>t answer a question, ask again, and again. I would also suggest sticking with one doctor unless he is really an idiot. Take the tests, films, etc. that you have already done with you, refuse to get them redone unless the doctor has a good reason. Good luck to you. Take care, Annette""Grammygirl44, Please do not even think about driving your car until this is fixed somehow. It is not worth getting someone else killed or injured, let alone yourself. Think of your 6 year old son!!! Take care, Annette""They are slightly different drugs. For me, the gabapentin worked better, I tried both. They are very similar, but not the same drug. They are not like a brand name drug and the generic equivalent. Glad you found something that worked for you. Take care, Annette""I am not sure what your abbreviations stand for, what is an ""ICD"", and when you say you ""went into chf on the mri table"", I assume ""chf"" stands for chronic heart failure, but that makes little sense in context of an MRI for spinal pain. What does your cardiologist feel about your ability to withstand withdrawals? Why is your doctor ""no longer prescribing pain meds"" did he get into some kind of trouble? How long do you have Butrans patches for? Have you already run out? Take care, Annette""I remembered ICD as ""implanted cardiac defibrillator"" in the middle of the night of course. My uncle had one. Do you know why you have CHF? Lots of doctors prefer not to write triplicates. The cardiologist must not be very worried about withdrawals or he would have done something to help you, if only a referral to someone else more willing to handle this. I would ask the PM doctor to taper you off slowly, if you are at a dose that requires this precaution. Where are you right now, are you still on the Butrans patch, how many do you have left? What dose are you on? Do not be afraid of withdrawal, it depends on the individual, and many people have minimal symptoms. My husband withdrew from methadone for chronic pain without any withdrawal symptoms at all. Back when he had cancer he told me he came off of Percocet and MS without any problems then either. I would go back to your original doctor that put you on this drug and ask him who you should go see. Since you have FMS, perhaps a rheumatologist who takes care of FMS patients?? Take care, Annette""Orthopedic surgeons often have little to no training in dealing with chronic pain, but at least he is willing, and using several kinds of treatment to help you manage your pain. Take care, Annette""Not all offices do the expensive tests. My doctor did when she was in her own office, but anyone with Medicare and no other insurance got them for free, thanks to the lab that did the tests. I have heard on this board that Medicare won<APO>t pay for them anyway. Her solo practice office ordered tests that told her how much of each drug was in your urine. The group practice she is in now, just does screening tests, positive or negative, much cheaper. I also asked about it and the MA told me it was a simple urine dip test done in the office. I have also learned to speak up about medical costs the last ten or fifteen years. Take care, Annette""The ER is no place to even try to deal with chronic pain issues. What else can they do but what they did, and hand out a few Norco and a list of doctors to follow up with. They are trained to deal with emergencies and not chronic pain issues. I hope you and the new doctor get on well and things go nicely on the 9th. Take care, Annette""You probably were in withdrawal. But, that is what the ER doctors do, they make sure you aren<APO>t dying of anything, and give you enough meds, hopefully, to get you to your own doctor. Hopefully, the new doctor will work out fine. Take care, Annette""If you were off the fentanyl for a month, he did right by starting you at a lower dose. It is easy to increase it slowly until your pain is managed better. There are different kinds of drug tests. My doctor did one that I was billed over $400 for, she called them and told them I was on Medicare, and took care of it for me. After she joined another group, they did one too, I asked her Medical Assistant if it was as pricey as the first one, and she said no, it was just a simple urine dip at the office, like a screening drug test rather than one that tells them exactly how much medicine is in your system. Take care, Annette""Due to my experience, I would not ask a doctor to take me as a patient and ask him to write RXs for opiates at the same time. I would see a doctor for a few visits and then approach him about meds. Trust needs to go two ways and it only develops with time. When he knows me, he may write RXs for me. I never move with out knowing where I will get RXs already, the old doctor has always been willing to continue to write RXs for me for the change over time. Doctors are able to retire, die, or move away, just like we are. As long as they give us notice, that is up to them. I would not repeat injections that I knew would make my pain worse, and not help anyway. A doctor would have to do some good talking to get me to consent to that. She is an adult and needs to take responsibility for finding a doctor to manage her care. It is great that you are willing to do this for her, but she needs to do it herself for many reasons. If you get an email address and post it online, there may be people here that live near you who are willing to respond with doctor suggestions. We are not allowed to post doctors, phone numbers, addresses here. Use an email other than your personal one to avoid spam in your personal email account. I live in another state so I can<APO>t help you. Take care, Annette""This is not uncommon at all. Please discuss this with your doctor. Doctors have heard of everything, so don<APO>t be embarrassed. These kinds of migraines are usually easily prevented by taking a migraine rescue drug an hour before having sex. You may have to try several different meds to find the right one for you. Take care, Annette""I<APO>ve had migraines for well over 15 years, and have never heard of these kinds of headaches being life threatening. Don<APO>t believe everything you read on line. Go to a doctor and get evaluated, you are different than everyone else, you should not self treat based on what other people do. Take care, Annette""That is the way medical care works here in the US, it sucks. Is there any chance of getting COBRA coverage?? I know it is very expensive. Check out free/low cost clinics in your area. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I was replying to glid06 who stated he/she lost his job and has no health insurance. This is a medical not political thing. I have worked in hospitals and volunteered at free/low cost medical clinics. You are right that the US has great health care if you can afford it, but unfortunately we have lousy access to that health care for folks who cannot afford it. I don<APO>t agree with Obama<APO>s medical care plan either. I think the best thing it to get rid of ALL insurance companies and let health care be handled by a system that is run by the government. Taxes would pay for it, like in other countries with universal care. For some folks there are no ""programs"" to save them, they might make a bit too much cash to get Medicaid. Take care, Annette Take care, Annette""In my humble opinion, if your foot is changing colors and temperatures that is probably a vascular problem. Could neurologic problems be affecting the circulation? Maybe. See what the vascular surgeon says, and ask him if it is time to see a neurologist??? Knees are complicated joints, I hope you are seeing a knee specialist in the orthopedic field. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Good plan, keep in touch. Take care, Annette""At least three days for urine testing, longer if they take a hair sample. I would not bother taking her cough syrup, the amount of codeine in it is very small anyway. Call the doctor and ask him if you may use her leftover medicine if you know him really well, but I would expect the doctor to want to see you in person before prescribing anything. That is just good medical practice. Take care, Annette""In my experiences with surgery, part of the scar frequently hurts for awhile, up to a year at least. I had breast reduction surgery just over a year ago, and I still have pain in parts of the scar. Same thing happened when I had neck surgery and abdominal surgery. I just expect it to happen, it has always gone away eventually. I am 61 years old. I would not fear dependence on the opiate pain meds, as long as you taper off of them slowly it should really be no big deal. If the pain is debilitating take the meds as prescribed. It is far easier to deal with the pain if you take the meds when it first starts. All the medical studies have shown that people take less pain meds and have better pain control that way than if they wait until the pain is really bad to take their meds. Talk to your PM doctor and get the most out of the meds. Ask what other alternatives you have as far as treatment goes. But do not be afraid of the meds. My husband used opiates daily for two years and finally had surgery to fix his hip, he tapered off of the meds completely. He also used them before I knew him for cancer pain and stopped using them when the pain went away. He denies ever having withdrawal symptoms. Let us know what you decide to do and how it works for you. Take care, Annette""You don<APO>t see a doctor for dance instruction and you shouldn<APO>t be counting on a dance instructor for medical help. Please go see a doctor, get a proper evaluation/examination/imaging tests done and find out what the problem is and where to start with treatment. Take care, Annette""Your doctor may feel that by prescribing Lortab to you, he is allowing you to continue doing work that does not allow your back to get well. Is there any kind of non-physical work that you can do? Is that what you are currently doing? Doctors are sometimes not aware of the financial realities of working, as far as supporting oneself, and providing oneself with health insurance. What reason does he give you for not prescribing pain meds any more? Take care, Annette""How many Lortabs are you taking each day? Perhaps the doctor feels it might be time to switch to a long acting pain med. Please discuss this all with your current doctor, including both the meds, AND the financial problems you face without insurance. He may well be able to help you with both. Take care, Annette""I would try calling around and see if other PM clinics insist on the same things, sounds nuts to me. Tests that you have done recently should not be repeated without a valid reason. Too much radiation is not good for you, in addition to the added expense which would be crazy. Does your current PA work with an MD or on her own? Maybe discussing this all with the MD might help??? Addiction is a terrible disease also, I would far more rather have chronic pain than an addiction problem. I wish they would come up with some kind of test that proves we have pain and how much, oh well..... Take care, Annette""The problems with Soma and valium when mixed with opiates have come out in medical studies and research, it is not a ""legal"" kind of problem. I do not use those types of drugs with my opiates. The DEA is a federal agency and its rules are valid in all 50 states, they do not vary from state to state. I have migraines, they have varied in frequency and intensity over the years. I read the studies on Botox injections some years ago, and decided not to try it, it was very expensive and the success rate was only about a 50% reduction in headaches in 50% of the patients it was used on. I think the important thing for you is how did it work for YOU the last time you tried it? If it helped, maybe it is worth it to try again with a larger dose... Take care, Annette""I was told by the instructor at a pain management class for healthcare professionals that benzos and ALL opioids, (not just methadone, but all other opiates also) had been shown to interact poorly. She felt within a few years, no doctors would prescribe opiates and benzos at the same time. This research had not yet been released in its final form. Take care, Annette""We are all free to disagree about anything, that is the wonder of America. I like evidence based medicine, and just repeated information I was told during the class I took a few years ago. I have read and heard more of the same, that benzos and opioids (not just methadone) are not a good mix. My personal opinion is that benzos are one of those old medicines that are slowly being replaced by safer drugs. I do not take any benzos, and have not had this discussion with my doctor ever, not sure where you got that. Doesn<APO>t really matter. Glad you are feeling good on your current regimen. Take care, Annette""My brother has tinnitus also, he is 50 years old it just happened to him. My son has had intermittent bouts with it since his deployment and traumatic brain injury, too many rockets exploding near him, thank goodness no direct hits, lol. His has diminished somewhat with time, I think, he doesn<APO>t like talking about any of that stuff. It is surprising how many people have tinnitus when you talk about it. I am glad to hear you are feeling some better, even if not 100%. Do I need to send in the card in the magazine for a subscription, or did you already do that? They have a nice way of explaining things and using language. Not too medicalese but not talking down to readers either. Thanks again. Hugs, Annette""Thanks again. I haven<APO>t been on line as much as usual lately, still regularly, but certainly not daily. I forgot how many ""neurological"" problems I have, so many things are neurologically related. Hugs, Annette""I got my first copy of Neurology Now, it is a great magazine!!! I am loving it, it is very informative and has a good variety of topics. Thank you so much. I hope you are feeling better, and do not feel so fatigued all the time. Did the Zithromax work? Hugs, Annette""First, you have to differentiate between allergies and side effects. True drug allergies cause an itchy rash, and perhaps shortness of breath, sometimes caused by tightening of the throat and/or chest. True allergies can progress with repeated exposure and end up causing anaphylaxis and sometimes death. Things like nausea, sedation, dizziness or vomiting are side effects, not true allergies. I wondered about this when you asked if the new drug would ""make her sick??"". Side effects like nausea and vomiting, etc. often go away after a few weeks on a new medicine. The doctor can even prescribe another drug to deal with the side effects at first if necessary. If she has true multiple drug allergies, I would suggest she see an allergist and ask him what to do as far as allergy testing. There is no way of knowing what new drug reactions she may have unless she tries them out or has allergy testing. Take care, Annette""How is she taking her meds? If a combination makes her too sleepy, she should discuss with her doctor how to best use them, either singly or in combination. A friend of mine practically passed out on her pain meds, she did not understand how to take them and ended up taking ALL of them at one time, she is lucky she didn<APO>t stop breathing instead of just falling down. If her pcp is not up to date on pain management techniques, she could go see a pain management specialist. It might be good for her to ask her oncologist or the radiation doctor involved with her care for a referral or a suggestion on who to see. Medicine has so many specialists it is hard to keep up with them all, but it is just too big a field for one doctor to stay up to date on all aspects of medicine. Take care, Annette""Talk to your doctor directly about these problems. He may or may not be able to fix them for you, but he should be able to tell you why they are happening. Take care, Annette""Don<APO>t drink, it could kill you. Pancreatitis is nothing to fool with, we do not have any kind of effective treatment for it. We just put people basically on GI rest until it passes. Have you tried any alcohol treatment programs? Take care, Annette""I would also see a second doctor for another opinion. First he wanted you off of the hydrocodone, now he wants you down to two a day. I assume he is aware that you also have other pain conditions that are not going to go away. Orthopedic doctors are not trained in pain management as a rule. I think they should do what they do and let pain management doctors do what they do. Best of luck. Take care, Annette""It sounds to me like you have already made up your mind, good for you. You might discuss this with your pcp and see what he thinks. There may be a non-surgical way of dealing with your pain. and stiffness. Take care, Annette""Talk to your doctor about the best way to take gabapentin. I refused to take it for a long time because I had heard it was very sedating. My internist who manages all my meds, told me that her patients and other medical reports said that taking it once a day worked just as well. I agreed to give it a try, and have always taken it once a day after supper, a few hours before bedtime. I have been on it for well over ten years now. That way I don<APO>t get any sedation except while I am asleep, which is fine with me. Night time leg pains may be due to something else, discuss them with your doctor also. Take care, Annette""Years ago I had the drunk feeling you are talking about, but it only lasted a few weeks. Gabapentin is great for me. I tried Lyrica and it did not do any better. I lift weights for about ten minutes a day, and bellydance for an hour a day, every day. I have been exercising like this for about two or three years now, it is the best thing I have ever done. I know exercise won<APO>t hurt me. I think cognitive behavioral therapy is a great option for me. As long as the opiates work for me, and I can stay at reasonable doses, I will stick with them. Take care, Annette""I love CBT, had never heard of ACT before. I will look into it. Depending on your body, there are always exercises that won<APO>t do damage, ask your doctor for a list. They have pool exercises for less weight on joints and wheel chair exercises for the chair bound. Take care, Annette""You might ask your pcp for a referral to a physiatrist or a gerontologist to see what else might help you. I have never seen a chronic back pain case where the only option is surgery. Lots of folks, especially older folks, do not want to have surgery. If it has been stable for two years, I bet you have other choices. Take care, Annette""I would ask him to share this with his doctor. Has he ever shown signs of being bi-polar in the past? I got an energy boost, felt a hyperactive zing from hydrocodone many years ago when I first started taking it, it was noticable, but went away after a few weeks. I would certainly not recommend taking something else to get rid of these feelings without his doctor suggesting them. If he stopped taking the oxycodone a week ago, it would not seem like a medicine side effect at this point. I am confused by your post though, you said he had surgery one week ago and was on morphine for a week, and he was on oxycodone but stopped taking those a week ago also. When was the accident that broke both scapula? Just before the surgery? Tell him to talk to his doctor... Take care, Annette""With the drugs used in conscious sedation, it is normal to be ""awake"", responding to instructions, moving as instructed, etc., but still have no memory of the procedure afterwards. ""Conscious"" does mean awake. Retrograde amnesia so that you don<APO>t remember unpleasant procedures is a pleasant side effect of the versed that is normally given during conscious sedation. Unfortunately, the last time you had it and woke up disoriented and terrified you probably just had an adverse reaction to the same drug, if indeed the same drug was given. Or perhaps you could have used a higher dose? No one here can guess accurately what happened. You would have to get your medical records to find out for sure if you had the same drug/dose as the other times. I am a bit confused because you say you woke up feeling this way, but then you say you don<APO>t remember anything but feeling sick and having a severe headache. Do you actually remember waking up and feeling disoriented, or is that what your fiance told you? I have had a very few patients over the years that had conscious sedation and did remember the procedure, it does not work on everyone the way they hope it will. That is the way drugs are. Did you have a history of migraines prior to the procedure? Have the headaches you are having now been diagnosed as migraines? Is it possible they are from leaking spinal fluid that would require a blood patch? If you have had migraines previously, then it is possible that these are just migraines and really aren<APO>t related to the procedure at all, just coincidence that they happened now, or perhaps they were triggered by the procedure. I have migraines, and many things can trigger an episode where I get them daily for awhile. Naturally, if your pain is worse, and your balance and coordination are worse, you need to see and be evaluated by your own doctor. Take care, Annette""1. I doubt that having bronchitis when you had the last injection could be causing the symptoms you mentioned. Discuss this with your doctor. 2. Yes, it is normal to have no recollection of anything until just before you go home when you have conscious sedation. When we used this in the ER to reduce dislocations, put in chest tubes, etc. it was typical for the patient to ask, ""Well, when are we going to do it?"" just after it was all finished. It meant that the drug worked like it should. This was usually the first clue that they were becoming alert enough to be discharged. 3. You could be having memories that are real, or you could be having very vivid dreams/nightmares. Both are possible side effects of the drugs used in conscious sedation. 4. I don<APO>t know what is wrong, because I am not sure what you are referring to. The increased headaches/migraines may be related to the procedure or may not be. The epidural injections may not have been effective since you say your pain and other symptoms are worse than before. These are things you need to discuss with your doctor, not a bunch of laypeople on the internet. We weren<APO>t there, don<APO>t know your medical history, and don<APO>t know the drugs/doses you were given. We are doing mostly guesswork, your doctor is closer to knowing what may have actually happened. If you don<APO>t feel comfortable discussing this with the doctor who did the injections, then discuss it with your pcp. Take care, Annette""I am confused when you say you don<APO>t know what your doctor thinks, but ""according to my fiance..."". It sounds like you need to ask more questions yourself, and write down the answers if need be so you remember them later. Go back to this doctor of yours and ask all your questions and tell him what your present symptoms are. DO NOT get up and leave the room until he answers you to your satisfaction. It is fine to have your fiance there for moral support and to ask questions of his own, but you need to be in charge of the appt. 85% of the cases of bronchitis are not due to bacterial infections so antibiotics would not make any difference as far as preventing or curing bronchitis or a sinus infection. Most of them are viral or due to allergies. Antibiotics do not prevent this type of infection. The only times I am aware of that using antibiotics before a procedure is necessary are if you have had a joint replacement or heart valve problems. This is because bacteria that float around in the blood stream due to dental or surgical procedures tend to grab hold on artificial joints and heart valves and cause infections. The Infectious Disease Board in my state only recommends antibiotics for bronchitis only if the patient has a positive culture or has chronic obstructive lung disease, or is a heavy smoker. Bronchitis and sinusitis are two of the illnesses where antibiotics are unnecessarily and vastly over-prescribed and this is part of why we are developing super bugs that are resistant to antibiotics. It really sounds like the main problems you are having are the headaches after the procedure, and the fact that the injections did not seem to help your original pain. Discuss this with your doctor. Take care, Annette""""When one has symptoms that sound like the clopping of hooves, you look for horses, not zebras"". This is an old medical school saying. It means first you check for the most common problems, like leaking fluid after an epidural injection. Once you rule that out, then you look for the more rare things like brain abscesses. The CT scan you had would probably have shown any abscess if you had one, so stop worrying about that. I would also suggest you stop reading articles and trying to self-diagnose. If you have symptoms, see the doctor and tell him. Certainly if that fails and no one will listen to you, do some research, but then make an appt. and take copies of the articles you are concerned with to the doctor so he can address your worries. If the anesthesiologist is not responsive then go see your pcp or your psychiatrist. Sometimes another doctor calling them will get through to them that there IS a problem that needs to be dealt with. Or perhaps the other doctors can reassure you. If you feel your symptoms are important enough to be bothering you this much, I would start by calling the anesthesiologist<APO>s office and telling him if he can<APO>t see you sooner than that, you will be going to the ER, that your symptoms are that bad. That should communicate your feeling that this needs to be addressed NOW, not on the 12th. If he doesn<APO>t know you are living in utter panic, he is not going to call you and move your appt. up. Our doctors expect us to call them and make an appt. if we are having problems. The 12th is Easter Sunday by the way, are you certain that is the day of your appt.? Take care, Annette""I am an old nurse, and I always make a list of what I need to ask my doctor about, I also make her a list of all my current meds, including doses, and hand it to her as she sits down. I write down what she tells me to do before I leave. I am a visual learner and I remember things better when I see them than when I hear them. I had a rheumatologist once who gave every patient written instructions relating to their visit at the end of every visit. I adored him, lol. Every doctor should do that. He had a copy for the patient and a copy went in your chart, no one could ever say he didn<APO>t tell them something. Not all ERs send copies of your visits to your primary doctor. I have worked in many ERS, and actually this is rare. Only one small town I worked in did this. I would not count on even the office help to write down why you are there. Usually they only write down the chief complaint, not everything you say. When the doctor sits down for your visit, tell him immediately what your main concern is. Do not get up or tell him you are done until you have dealt with all the things on your list. If I will need more than 10-15 minutes, I tell the woman who schedules the appts. that I will need more time than usual, so she can schedule the doctor for the proper amount of time. If you are organized, you can accomplish a lot in 10 minutes. I always repeat back to the doctor what my understanding of the instructions are. If I got something wrong it gives her a chance to correct me. I learned to do this in nursing school, it makes things safer. You are not stupid, and should not feel embarrassed. You are paying him for his time, you should be working together to improve your health and happiness. Hopefully, you will become more skilled in controlling your appts. and communicating your needs. It just takes practice. It is easy for me because I am in my element, I have been a RN for nearly 39 years, I know how to talk to doctors. I was not good at it when I first became an adult and saw doctors without my mom, lol. We all learn as we go along in all aspects of our lives. You have additional challenges due to your depression and anxiety issues, but you can do it too. Take care, Annette""If you want to get your medical records, just write to the office or hospital and ask for them stating your name, birthdate, and the date of the visit(s) you want the records of. It sounds like you just had an adverse reaction to the drug, it can happen to anyone. Some people remember the whole procedure, some remember just bits and piesces of it, some remember nothing. As a nurse, I remember the times before we had these drugs, and people went through nasty procedures in the ER without sedation, just some pain meds. Boy, it is better with these meds than without them. Take care, Annette""Good job, I am glad you didn<APO>t toss the ER papers in the trash like so many people do. Take the reports with you to the doctor when you go on the 14th, along with your own list of concerns, and your sweetie-pie. Take care, Annette""I would go back and see him again. Tell him all about this issue. Often just a good evaluation and exam will tell you what you need to know. Take care, Annette""This can take quite awhile to heal and can be very painful. My friend broke her tailbone and she was off of her horse for 6-8 months. She sat on a donut pillow at work, but did manage to keep working. She was in her thirties at the time. If I were you, I would go to the doctor with her, and have her tell the doctor that the Nucynta is not working and can she try something else. It seems to be a drug that either works really well for folks, or does not work at all. I have no personal experience with it myself. Take care of each other. Annette""Go see your doctor, let him do a history and physical exam and whatever tests he feels are needed. Shoulders are complicated joints, and it is best to keep them functional as long as possible. Take care, Annette""You might have more than one diagnosis. You may also have let your conditioning go down due to the RA. I have fibromyalgia and other things too. I followed the advice in a book about Fibro by a doctor who has it, to keep my arms low, and avoid pain by not using them so much. That might have been good advice at the time, but not now. I really lost strength in my arms, and other places too, by avoiding use to avoid the pain. Now I exercise everyday, and take the pain pills that I do use more wisely. I actually feel better all over, not necessarily less pain, just feel better. There are no sensory nerves in your organs, so whatever you are feeling, please don<APO>t worry about that, it is probably in the muscles on the abdominal wall. Follow up with your doctor about your RA, that can attack many areas of your body. Take care, Annette""Please be sure and discuss your pain levels with your doctor, so he knows just what you are doing now. I have 4-5 friends who have had total knees (no partial kness) and always had some kind of pain afterwards, but got their mobility back and they all said their pain was different from their pre-op pain, and was tolerable. Like Swank said it take about a year to even recover from any surgery, so don<APO>t be too rough on yourself at six months postop. Take care, Annette""Forget the old saying about ""no pain, no gain"", just find your new normal. Acute pain is usually a warning of something wrong in your body. Chronic pain is something else altogether, do not let it come to that. Talk to your surgeon, do what he says to do. My old PM doctor, a former neurosurgeon, and currently a pain management specialist said to always exercise, but in small increments, working slowly up to the best you can do. He said when pain went up, to go back on exercise, but keep it up. Take care, Annette""I went to a big store once and all the handicapped places were parked in, three by cars that did not display placards. When I went inside, I complained to the manager, he said it was the city<APO>s responsibility to enforce that, but when I got home and called the city, they told me they are not allowed to give tickets on private property only on city streets for parking tickets of any kind??? I gave up after that. Some days I need my placard and some days I don<APO>t. When there is only one handicapped parking place available, I park elsewhere in case someone worse off than I needs it. Take care, Annette""Please go see your doctor, it really does not matter if anyone has had similar episodes. It sounds scary to me. Take care, Annette""Just let your doctor know and tell him you are having a problem with availability. A pharmacist may also be useful. I take generic oxycodone in 5 mg. pills, works fine for me, and the 5 mg. is available where I live. The pharmacist just wrote on the label how many to take. There is also immediate release morphine, and other meds also. Take care, Annette""You need to talk to the doctor who put you in the aircast to begin with. Many pain pills give one a boost of energy for awhile, unfortunately that goes away with time for most of us. Take care, Annette""Just think back to the olden days of plaster casts, and you will be happier about the air cast, lol. Stick it out and do as you are told. Better it should heal properly than badly and give you a chronic problem. Take care, Annette""Tell your regular doctor all that you have told us, just be honest about what you have tried already. You will need his support in the disability process anyway. Take care, Annette""I think he needs to follow up with the neurologist that took care of his stroke problems. Everyday headaches can be made worse by over the counter pain meds, he needs to talk to the neurologist about these. Take care, Annette""My son serving in Afghanistan and Iraq taught me patience. ""Don<APO>t sweat the small stuff"" is my motto. We could all be far worse off than we are. Hugs, Annette""I am not familiar with the process in Ohio. I don<APO>t really think Oxycontin or any specific drug is better than another. There are side effects to all of them, the secret is to find the dose that offers pain assistance but do not go up so high that she gets side effects. Some side effects will go away with time. Talk to her doctor and ask for his help. Take care, Annette""I would go see my pcp first off and if she could not figure it out, I would go see a neurologist. Speak up and do not leave the office if they do nothing at all. A good doctor will at least send you to a specialist if he has no answers. Take care, Annette""If it always stops when you roll over on your back, just do that. Or try ear plugs. However, I would mention this whole thing to your doctor, and see what he says. He should examine you to see if anything is wrong. Take care, Annette""I find it is best not to ask for any meds by name. It is normal for opiate type pain meds to not work as well as before with the same dose after awhile. Just tell your doctor that they do not seem to work as well and ask him what he suggests you do. He may suggest a higher dose or taking it more frequently, he may suggest a change in meds, or adding a long acting opiate that you take on a schedule. Take care, Annette""I have not had knee replacement surgery myself, but four of my friends had it done, half to one knee and half to both. I asked and they all said they had continued pain, but it was different than before their surgery. All their doctors said everything was fine with their knees as far as the surgery went. All had great mobility and were glad they had surgery done. I think the outcome really depends on what your expectations were prior to the surgery. I would see a pain management doctor at this point in time and see what he says. Don<APO>t jump into any treatment, just hear him out and think about it for awhile. Do your research, there is no emergency after three years. Take care, Annette""Thank you for your service for our country. Take care, Annette""You need to ask questions prior to having any procedure done, including injections. Do not wait for him to offer information, although he should. Ask him all your questions and write down the answers to review later on when you are not as stressed as one often is in the doctor<APO>s office. Take care, Annette""Most opiates can cause itching as a side effect, but it generally goes away after awhile. How long varies from one person to another. If it still causes itching after a month or two, talk to your doctor again. It is not a sign that you body is rejecting the pain medicine, it is just a side effect. Unless you get a hives-like rash it isn<APO>t even a sign of an allergy. I would get a generic, store brand of Benedryl and try that. It is much cheaper than the brand-named drug that way. Talk to your doctor and pharmacist first. There are other anti-histamines they may suggest. Take care, Annette""Just talk to your doctor, let him know how things are going with you. Please make sure there is someone nearby when you add any new medicine, even over the counter ones. You might get excessive sedation. Take care, Annette""Are you taking benzos, ambien, and soma now? And you asked your pcp for pain meds on top of that? I would be concerned also, if that is all happening at the same time. What are you doing that does not include drugs to manage your bulging discs, insomnia, and anxiety? You did not mention what kind of MRI you wanted when you injured yourself this week, was it a spinal MRI of some kind? New spinal injuries generally do not need an MRI, and exercise is the right thing for him to prescribe for a new back injury as opposed to bedrest. I don<APO>t know exactly what he meant by exercise so it is hard to tell from your post. I don<APO>t know if you will have to consider being ""normal"" as also having chronic pain. I expect to be in pain the rest of my life, I do consider myself ""normal"" though. Take care of yourself. Find a new doctor if you wish, but do not base the choice on how free he is with his prescription pad. Annette""I take gabapentin for FMS and related issues, and have been losing weight slowly for several years. I stay away from SSRIs and SNRIs and related anti-depressant type meds as I have had bad side effects with many of them. I took tramadol along with the gabapentin and while taking vicodin for breakthrough pain, I had no problems at all. I find many doctors are not that into serotonin syndrome, just scared to death of it. It is pretty rare, my family doc told me about it over 15 years ago, he told me what symptoms to look out for and to stop all related drugs immediately and call him. I never needed to. Take care, Annette""All I can suggest in addition to what Beth already said, is that you might want to write things down and take the notes with you, and have your mom write down during the visit whatever the doctor tells you to try. I don<APO>t think you are asking for anything out of the ordinary. I have seen a pain management doctor 3-4 times in my life with FMS (16 years or so). My internist likes to have the advice and so do I. She generally manages my meds, etc. Take care, Annette""Ask the rheumy directly why he does not wish you to see a PM doctor? Do you need his approval or referral for your insurance? Can you choose someone on your own? Above all DO NOT be silent, speak up and voice your opinions and ask questions. Are you taking benzos for your anxiety? They may not work properly with opiates due to drug interactions. The rheumy may know that but not be discussing it with you. Take care, Annette""I think one can have a discussion with ones doctor without getting uptight. I have had them for years. If you question a doctor about a problem you are having in the right way, be nice, I have not found it to be a problem. I have fibro and have never been told by any doctor or mental health person that it was a psychiatric disorder, I will look for that thread you mention. I have used cognitive behavioral therapy for chronic pain and a situational depression I had many years ago. It cured the depression, and helps significantly with managing the chronic pain. Not that I would want to give up my pain meds, but I use both and find them both very helpful. Take care, Annette""Why do you have to have a referral? The first visit is usually very expensive though. Sorry, I have no other tricks up my sleeve. Keep trying the internet search engines to find a free/low cost clinic in your area. Take care, Annette""Keep applying and appealing their denials. Get more info from your doctors and talk to the judge when that comes up. It is usually on the third go-round with SSDI. I believe in using a lawyer for this as early on as they will accept you. I was also turned down twice, the judge accepted my claim in court when I got the chance to speak to him in person. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t think we have enough information to determine if the PM doctor he might see is an interventionist or not. The fact that he has no insurance and no $$ to pay his present doctor really limits his choices. Few doctors will take on free patients if they do not already know them well unless the doctor is already hooked up with a free/low cost clinic and you are willing to jump through all the hoops to see them. You are right, they are less than optimal for SSDI, they would much rather you be seeing a doctor on an ongoing basis. Doctors usually have several hundred active patients at any one time, so I am used to them not knowing every patient. That said, if he had to physically change his exam room to accommodate your power chair, he SHOULD remember you. My doctor recently changed to a multiple doctor set up instead of practicing solo, they use computerized charts, she is still trying to figure that out instead of trying to read handwriting. Take care, Annette""Go see a doctor and do not try and diagnose yourself. Take care, Annette""I agree with Dave as usual. Please see a doctor. Take care, Annette""Best of luck with your elevated B/P. It sounds like the doctor is going in the right direction. Also remember that doctors are often wrong in their long term (more than a few weeks) predictions. They told my husband he would die from his cancer, non-Hodgkin<APO>s lymphoma, within six months and that was over 20 years ago, he is still here and finally retired last year. They told a nurse friend of mine that she would be in a wheelchair by the time she was 25, at 40 she was still working in the ER, doing nursing in airplanes for transfers, etc. Take care, Annette""I agree with Swank, 88 for the lower BP number is not all that great, but you are on the road and that is the important thing. It is always good to check the blood pressure later on in the visit, not right away like they usually do, it should be rechecked if it is high towards the end of the visit. Give your body time to settle down. Chronic pain does not always change the blood pressure like acute pain does, that is why it is so important to check it and treat it appropriately. Remember, just because we have chronic pain, does not mean we can<APO>t get all the other illnesses in life. Take care, Annette""It is fine to refuse to take any drug that you have tried before and it either did not work, or you had a bad reaction to it. Just TELL the doctor exactly what you are doing. If you fill the RX and decide not to take it, he has no way of knowing what is going on, and how to best care for you. I don<APO>t take any of the antidepressant drugs either, I have tried at least one from each family and they affected my memory so much. My doctor knows not to bother with them anymore. How is your blood pressure doing? Take care, Annette""I have known four women who had either one or both knees replaced in the last 25 years or so. All did well as far as mobility goes, which was their goal. But, all continued to have some kind of pain. They said it was different than before the surgery, but they all have had it. None take opiate meds anymore. I think you need to make sure your husband has the right surgeon and hospital. The least amount of time he stays in the hospital the better, due to the risk of getting an infection. He also needs to be sure and do whatever the doctor tells him to do as far as rehab and exercise goes. Make sure he and the doctor are on the same page as far as his expectations after the surgery. Is he doing the surgery for pain management, or for mobility? Take care, Annette""Vicodin is an opiate pain med. He should not wait to take his meds until the pain is severe. Better to take it earlier on, it will work better, his pain will be less, and in the end he will probably take less anyway. All this is old medical stuff I was taught in nursing school many, many years ago. Now that I have chronic pain, I have found this to be true. My husband had a hip replaced several years ago, his gait also changed, and he got used to walking kind of hunched over before the surgery. The hip surgery is generally easier to get over than knee surgery. Your husband may always have some kind of pain in his knee, but the best thing, I feel, is to see a good doctor or two or three before any new surgery. He may have already done this. Once his knee is fixed, work on his gait and posture with the doctor and a good PT. Take care, Annette""My friends that had knee replacements also did recumbent bike riding in PT. I think because it is a non-impact exercise it is probably good for them. I belly dance along with DVDs on the TV. I will never look or dance like the women in the DVDs, but I love doing it. I have done it for one hour every day for nearly three years now. The only break I took was on vacation for a week with my son and his family. If he loves it, encourage him to do it. Make sure he wears a helmet though. Take care, Annette""Interesting!! Has your doctor suggested this use? What does he say about thins? I am only familiar with EMLA cream used to numb the skin before starting IVs or for IV port access. Does it contain anything that would be harmful to the skin when used over time? Take care, Annette""""External use"" means on regular skin, not the mucous type tissue of your anus. Please discuss this with your doctor before using any more. Take care, Annette""As long as the doctors said it was okay, good for you. I think that thinking outside the box often gives us answers to problems we have. As long as you checked it out with the doctors or the pharmacist and use it as they direct as far as how often, etc. that is great. Take care, Annette""Are you talking about possible residue from a pill that was in the box at one time? Did you take the pill, or are you concerned about pill residue getting into your system and causing a problem? It might help if we knew what exactly the pill/residue was, what you tested positive for, and what you are currently on. Take care, Annette""Talk to the folks at the lab and ask them what might cause this. Did the test show you took your other pain meds? Maybe the specimens were switched by accident? Talk to your doctor and ask him what might cause this. Take care, Annette""170 mg. a day of methadone is a huge dose. It is hard to believe a doctor increased your dose that much in just two years! Anything over about 60 mgs. a day is considered a high dose by most healthcare professionals. I happily take methadone and also oxycodone for breakthrough pain, but would not accept that high a dose of methadone from anyone. We are about the same age. Methadone is a long acting opioid, so it might be inadvisable to take another long acting opioid with it, something short acting is usually added to it on an as needed basis. Most medical literature supports only using one long acting opioid at a time. Can<APO>t the doctor switch you over to a different opioid? Or does he consider your present dose too high for that? Maybe you should get a second opinion from another doctor? I have had severe migraines and done my own research, opiate are generally not recommended for migraines because they can cause rebound type headaches. Menopause helped mine some, has it helped yours? When I first got them at age 35, they gave me opiates for them, as more research and newer meds came out, the doctors gradually stopped prescribing opiates and switched over to other meds. I had as good pain control as I did with the opiates. Pain is a very scary thing, please do your own research as well as listening to your doctors. Take care, Annette""Please tell your psychiatrist about the methadone sooner rather than later. Try discussing with your doctor tapering more slowly, maybe try 5 mg. a day per week, rather than 10 mg. at one time Or switch to short acting opiates and take them on an as needed basis. Methadone is not meant to be taken as needed to manage withdrawal symptoms. You take it on a set schedule as prescribed. Take care, Annette""When you take less methadone and get withdrawals and then take 10 mg. more as you said in your previous post, that sounds like ""as needed"" to me. I pay about $7/ month for my methadone RX at the pharmacy, the total cost to the insurance company is less than $30 per month. It sounds to me like you go to a methadone clinic that is primarily used by opiate addicts for maintenance??? Employers are not allowed to ask you what health problems you have by law, and if you must take a drug abuse screening test prior to being employed the RX meds you are on should be confidential and not given to the employer either. The medical people just compare them to what came back on the screening test to make sure you have a RX for that med. If at 170 mg. a day the methadone did not get rid of your pain, then my guess would be that opioids are not going to work for you. You might need to find a different medication or treatment plan for your problems. Your doctor probably wants you off of it because it does not work for you. He has to be able to justify using it, and if it doesn<APO>t work for your pain, he can<APO>t do that. It is nuts if regular doctors are not allowed to prescribe opiates at all, I think the person who told you that did not know what he was talking about. Call the state board of medical licensing in Florida and they can tell you what the laws are there about pain meds. I have a friend in Polk County, Florida, and she gets opiates from her regular family doctor. Don<APO>t assume from your diagnosis that you will have pain, not all folks with DDD have any pain, let alone severe pain. Take care, Annette""Hi, Tedzilla01 I am an RN, who currently uses methadone for chronic pain, and I actually used to work in a methadone maintenence program for heroin addicts in the good old days, pre-chronic pain. I have been at both ends of this discussion. No opioid fixes or relieves all pain, so on that, you are correct. Methadone does keep addicts from getting ""high"" from illicit opioids if the once daily dosage is adequate. Since I am not looking to get high, that is not important to me. I can get additional pain relief from oxycodone 20 mg. as needed for breakthrough pain, I use it about twice a day. It works fine, even though I take methadone three times a day. I use a vastly lower dose than people who are trying to get off of opioids do. Back in the day when I was working at the heroin treatment clinic as an RN, the once daily dose of methadone went as high as 180 mg. I take 30 mgs. a day split into three doses of 10 mgs. each, for my chronic pain. I have been on daily opioids for about 18 years now. I opt to use methadone due to its cheapness, I am on Medicare now, and do not want to hit that dreaded donut hole, and have to pay full price for all my meds. I should have opted to use it years ago, don<APO>t know why I didn<APO>t. I went to nursing school in 1968-70, methadone was in use then for pain as part of a cocktail of drugs used to treat cancer pain. My first job as a nurse was at the heroin clinic, methadone was considered an ""experimental"" drug for opiate addiction back then. Trust me, the dynamic of the drug is totally different when used for different purposes and in vastly different DOSES. This is not that uncommon amongst many drugs. As a matter of fact, I feel withdrawal is over-rated. All drugs one is concerned about need to be tapered gradually. I tapered my husband off of his twice daily methadone and oxycodone ""as needed"", after he had hip replacement surgery and one other time. He had NO withdrawals at all. He had told me the same thing happened when he went off of daily percocet use back when he had cancer treatment. He stopped taking those abruptly. The older heroin addicts I knew while I worked at the clinic all told me opioid withdrawal was like a bad case of the flu and lasted 4-7 days maximum. We tapered them off of methadone very slowly, and painlessly. Usually, they did not even know about it until it was over. That is how it was done in those days. I am a control freak, I would hate not knowing my dose, and every little thing about my treatment. Everyone needs to know about their medicines and they can choose what to use for pain and addiction these days. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know what doctor you see, but the gem I have seen for the last 15 years or so, has written for what I have requested within reason. If she doesn<APO>t want to, she explains why and we come to another solution. It is a very collaborative relationship. I really can<APO>t remember any specific drug she has refused to give me that I asked for. We did discuss thyroid problems and she called a specialist right then and there to get more information that we needed. Take care, Annette""I am sorry I misunderstood your post. It said you began seeing an ER doctor<APO>s rehab clinic and they started you on methadone in 2000, and in 2002 you were taking 170 mg. a day of methadone at the time of your accident. At least that is how I understood it. Just take it slowly on the taper off of methadone. My husband went off of it twice in his lifetime, once after cancer treatment, and once after a hip replacement. He had no withdrawal at all, I think it is primarily the slowness of the taper that affects the withdrawals. Why haven<APO>t you told your psychiatrist about the methadone? He probably asked you to list all your medications at some time, how can he treat you properly if he is unaware of all that is going on with you? You need to keep looking for the right doctor, one who is comfortable treating all of you. My family practice doc that I was seeing many years ago told me that menopause will either help, hurt, or not affect migraines at all. 33% in each group, so just wait and see, he said. For me it got a bit better. I don<APO>t use the triptan type drugs at all anymore, too expensive. I use reglan 10 mg. with aspirin 975 mg. or ibuprofen 800 mg. Or I use compazine 10 mg. by mouth. The first gives me improvement about 85% of the time, and I add the compazine if necessary. I had rad a medical study about using IV compazine in the ER for migraines, (not just for nausea) and asked my doctor if I could try it at home. First I used rectal suppositories then went to pills. Cheap and easy, effective too. I have had both CT scans and MRIs of my head and spine. Neither can diagnose pain, only show structural changes in the body. I personally consider any clinic that does not accept insurance or Medicare to be questionable, and would not go to one that only accepted cash. Best of luck to you. I hope you are feeling better soon. Take care, Annette""Everyone responds differently to meds. Unfortunately there is no way to tell at this time who will react well and who will react badly. One can avoid withdrawals from any meds by tapering off slowly instead of stopping abruptly. I have taken Ultram (tramadol) for many years without any problems at all. We are all different. Take care, Annette""If you were taking so much because it wasn<APO>t managing your pain at the correct dose, then you should try other meds for your pain. The drug she started you on is fine to begin with. It will not treat your withdrawal sxs, but it may help with your pain. I would ask for treatment for the withdrawal first, enough Ultram to taper down slowly to minimize the withdrawal symptoms. I would also ask for pain meds to use specifically for pain as needed. The antidepressant she gave you works well for chronic pain, but it works more slowly, it could take several weeks to get its full effect. Take care, Annette""Ultram does not cause addiction that I am aware of, but it can cause dependence, and some people get withdrawal symptoms if they stop it suddenly. The instructions that come with mine say if you need to go off for some reason discuss tapering with your doctor if you have been taking it regularly for awhile. You are right in that we really don<APO>t know if the poster is withdrawing or is ill due to some other reason. Take care, Annette""Taking blood is considered an invasive procedure so they want a doctor<APO>s order to do it. Just ask your doctor to write one for you. Meanwhile talk to the lab that does the test and ask them what might cause it to come back negative when he takes the meds as ordered? Is it metabolized and broken down into something else that shows on the test? Talk to his doctor with him and ask what is going on, if the doctor is not worried, ignore the staff. But do tell the doctor that the staff has been treating him differently, if you feel they have. Take care, Annette""Dave provides good links, but you cannot count on on line sources for personal health care. Talk to your doctor, see the surgeon, I saw a neurosurgeon for my C5-6 discectomy many years ago. He was great for me. Later he did not suggest surgery for the adjacent disc that herniated 6 months later, he said to let it heal on its own. He was a good guy. Other people will swear by ortho or a spine specialist. I believe that there are many paths to learning, and it is up to you in the end to find a doctor that you feel good about. Get 2-3 opinions from unrelated doctors, discuss it with someone, and decide what to do. Everything will be fine. Take care, Annette""I agree with you completely. My family doctor diagnosed my C5-6 herniation and I went a couple more years before I wanted surgery on my neck. I was losing function in my hands. When the disc below that herniated, the surgeon did not recommend surgery, he said to try and wait it out. That worked too. Take care, Annette""Make sure the doctors know you are expecting pain relief from the surgery and find out what the odds are that you will get it. You might be surprised, my neurosurgeon would not do spinal surgery for pain relief because the odds were so bad that it would actually work. He only used surgery to repair function. I had a discectomy and spur removal many years ago. It fixed the loss of function in the affected arm. My fingers stopped working properly and I would drop stuff when I used my right hand. Six months later I herniated the next disc down, and did not have surgery. Things improved a lot over the next couple of years. Things may have improved since then. Talk to your surgeon. Get at least a second opinion, maybe three. Take care, Annette""I<APO>m fine, I make a point to be fine, lol. Of course, the discs are worse than 2008. DDD means degenerative disc disease, degenerative means it keeps getting worse. Your job is to deal with it as best you can and do whatever you can to slow it down. I opt not to have MRIs unless I clinically need one, not just to see how it is going. I also opt not to have surgery now. I had one surgery, and didn<APO>t have surgery the second go round with my discs. Same outcome as far as pain goes. The surgery I did have relieved the mobility problems I was having the first time with my hands. See several specialists and then make your own decision about surgery. Everyone is different. Take care, Annette""There are several kind of surgery done on spinal discs. I had one removed and let the two vertebrae above and below fuse naturally. No bone chips or hardware for me. It did fuse together, but took several months. There is/was a surgery that uses your own bone from your hip to replace the disc. My neurosurgeon was the only surgeon in town doing that kind of surgery back then. He told me the risks and let me decide which surgery to try. Take care, Annette""You follow the doctor<APO>s directions exactly and make another appt. for as soon as possible. Whenever a doctor is changing a person from one drug preparation to another it may take a few visits to get them adjusted on the right dose. I took generic long acting morphine for many years, from several manufacturers, they all worked fine. Go back and see the doctor face to face and tell him long it works for you and how well it does or does not work. He can adjust it. I went back and forth between every 12 hours and every 8 hours, it is dose dependent and worked either way for me. I agree with Dr. A that a comprehensive approach should be in your plan. Managing chronic pain is a complex thing and you need to approach it from all sides, not just drugs. Take care, Annette""How are you doing today? What did you decide to do? What did your doctor decide when you saw him Friday? Let him know that you tried to make an appt. and ask him what to do in the future if the need arises again. Put it in your contract if you feel it necessary. Most doctors have some kind of back up plan. My doctor keeps a couple of appts. open each day for emergencies, first come first serve, but I have always been able to get in within 24-48 hours anyway. My husband<APO>s doctor lets patients call at 7am for a limited number of appts. for emergencies. As long as we are calling at exactly 7 am, we have gotten in to see him. So far so good. I have found it is better to have a plan and not need it, than need it and not have one. Take care, Annette""I have only heard of a genetic ""predisposition"" for Fibro, that exists for many illnesses. It doesn<APO>t mean that it is for certain that you will get FMS, or pass it on to your kids. I have not read of any genetic markers specifically for FMS. I have FMS, and I agree with the comment you made that it is a benign syndrome. It sucks to have it, but it doesn<APO>t really cause any degenerative changes in the structure of the body or the organs. There are definite changes in the brain, and some other things that show up on PET scans, etc. in folks with FMS, but it is still at a research level, not a diagnostic one. I am the only one in a large extended family with FMS, so in my case it does not seem to run in my family. I think it is self diagnosed in many cases without even going to a doctor. I have met women who did that and NEVER saw a doctor at all, just went to support groups, and whined a lot, etc. I can remember when asthma was treated like an emotional problem too though. I think we need a lot more research to learn more about it, but I would want our limited funds to go to more important life threatening illnesses for now. Just my humble opinion. Take care, Annette""I agree that there is no genetic marker at this time for FMS. However, there have been PET scans of the brain that show clear differences between those with FMS and people without FMS. For this reason I believe that it IS a neurological disorder, with definitive indications of it being a physiological disorder. Take care, Annette""I agree that the study you mentioned sounds flawed. I will have to look up the sources, or ask Dr. Pellegrino on the FMS Board, he both has FMS, and treats folks with it. He also writes really funny books, makes you laugh, always good. Hugs, Annette""I mostly go to http://www.myalgia.com for FMS information. It is a site that is overseen by a FMS treatment group that I really trust at OHSU FMS clinic, run by Dr. Robert Bennett, MD, the last time I looked. I have been to seminars with Dr. Bennett speaking, and his studies are usually pretty good. By the way, I don<APO>t think I had any FMS symptoms till well into my adulthood, and I was lucky because my family practice doctor diagnoses it promptly, within 3-4 months of my first symptoms. Hugs, Annette""Even though it is a small percentage of folks that become addicted to opiates when taking them as directed by their doctors, it is still 1-2 people out of every 100 people. How many people are on opiates legally prescribed by their doctors, I bet it is a huge number. Not to mention those that do not get them from a doctor, they aren<APO>t included in these studies. If you are that one person out of one hundred, addiction IS a problem, and the sooner it is dealt with the better. I don<APO>t think anyone should stop taking their pain meds based on this, I will continue with mine. It is just something to be aware of. Take care, Annette""Oxycodone and Oxycontin contain the same drug in different forms, the first is immediate acting, the second is long acting. I have taken opioids for over 15 years, with no apparent addiction or organ problems. Just follow the instructions the doctor/pharmacy gives you. Do your own research on medical treatments and surgeries, but I would advise you to use appropriate sites with evidence based research on them. Take care, Annette""I too ask that question every time I take an opioid pain pill, regardless of what it is. The long acting ones generally should be taken on a regular schedule to be effective. I still ask the question, for my own peace of mind. If it were ever for other than pain (or as directed for the long acting pills), I would make an appt. with my doctor to discuss it. With the short acting meds, I would just not take the med until I really hurt, and discuss it with my doctor ASAP also. I have never had an addiction problem, but I did work with addicts when I was much younger, I do not want to go there. Take care, Annette""Sorry, but methadone was developed in Germany during WWII because they could not get enough morphine for their injured troops. I used it in nursing school in 1968-70 for the chronic pain of terminal cancer. I worked in drug abuse treatment in 1970-74 and we had a government license to use it on an experimental basis for opioid addiction. It was fairly new to addiction treatment at that time. It is not an anti-psychotic med, and I have not heard of this off label use before. Everyone has a right to their own opinions about using various meds. I do not take any antidepressants due to memory problems with many different classes of antidepressants. I DO take a small dose of methadone for chronic pain. It works well for me. I would not take a large dose due to an admittedly rare cardiac problem it is associated with. All opioids are addictive, I have not seen any medical studies that show this one is more addictive than the others, I would be happy to see any studies anyone has links to. I love research, especially evidence based research. Take care, Annette""Hi, I read the abstract, methadone was used WITH anti-psychotic drugs for dual diagnosis patients. The study only used four patients, so more research is necessary. Now I will read the other link you provided. Thanks a bunch. Hugs, Annette""I agree with you almost entirely. I do not personally know the original derivation of the name, but your other information is correct as far as I know. I used it in nursing school for pain in cancer patients in 1968-1970, and after that later in 1970, I used it as a nurse working in an addiction treatment center. We had to get special permission from the government because it was used on an experimental basis for addiction treatment at that time. Thanks for the post. Take care, Annette""Good luck to you. How did the phone call go? I always see my doctor in person to discuss pain med increases or increased pain. She wants to make certain it is still the original pain and not something new. I agree with her, mainly because I have seen how they work and prefer the privacy and focus given to me in person vs. on the phone. I have been on daily opioid therapy for about 15 years now and have never gotten to the dosages you use. I can<APO>t believe you got to 300 mg. of methadone in three years. I have been on it for 2.5 years (after taking morphine ER continually before that) and take only 20 mg. of methadone daily and also use oxycodone 15 mg. for breakthrough pain. Keep in touch. Take care, Annette""I use gabapentin for nerve related pain and I started at 300 mg. per day at bedtime, not three times a day. It made me feel kind of drunk for awhile, then that feeling went away. I stabilized at 800 mg. per day in the evening. Take care, Annette""If you do not know why you were dropped as a patient, ask her. Doctors usually send you a letter notifying you of being dropped. Send her a letter back certified mail, return receipt requested. Ask for specific things not generalities. However, non-compliance sounds pretty accurate. Asking her what she means by that specifically is reasonable. You can ask at the same time if it is okay to fill the RXs you have. Take care, Annette""He is probably old school and feels he can make a diagnosis based on listening to the bones in your shoulder rub together. We do have better imaging techniques now, and ordering on and basing his first impressions on what he heard is one thing, but not using the imaging we have available is nuts. As is waiting for a week for a refill at the pharmacy. I would look for a new doctor. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Yes, a neurologist would be fine for the next step. The CT is the important thing, it is fine, and that is important. That means no tumors or bleeds. It kind of rules out all the dire consequences. He still has to deal with the pain though. My choice would be to stay at the doctors office or ER until the pain goes down to an acceptable level. I would not take an injection and just go home, I would wait until it works. It may take more than one injection, or it may take an IV med at this point. He is lucky to have you looking out for him. Take care, Annette""I would suggest you find a doctor that is more compassionate and willing to work with you to find what works for you. School is too expensive to fail due to mobility problems. Take care, Annette""It depends on what medicines were used, if any. I had one tight muscle area injected and the relief was immediate. I do not know why she had trigger point injection, it is probably for a totally different problem than I had. Who knows except her doctor, she should ask him what the prognosis is and when she might feel relief. Take care, Annette""Happycouple001, You don<APO>t need to lift weights to lose weight. A class I went to suggested that you do the equivalent of 100 calories of exercise (they suggested just walking) and reduce your diet by 100 calories per day (one cookie or slice of bread would cover this). This is easy to do, and the weight loss will be slow but sure. I have lost over fifty pounds, but did it over couple of years. I continue to lose a couple of pounds every couple of months. Anyone who wants to lose a lot of weight quickly will probably hate this approach. Meanwhile I am 50 pounds leaner than I used to be. Talk to your pcp and make a plan first. Take care, Annette""It sounds like you both need to talk to your respective doctors and get on a diet/exercise plan. You can make an appt. with your pcp specifically to talk about your weight issues and a diet/exercise plan. You cannot change your wife<APO>s eating habits, that is up to her. Maybe she will get more motivated when she sees you losing inches, maybe she will feel insecure about it. We do not know, you can only manage your own eating habits. I only get weighed at my doctor<APO>s office every three months or so. She says to ignore the numbers, as muscle weighs more than fat, and how I feel is more important than the numbers. We all have weights that we are comfortable with, but three hundred pounds. My husband does not need to lose weight, I do. He has seems to be happy with me at whatever weight I am at. Lucky me!!! Take care, Annette""It sounds like you are ready to me, I would also suggest you take someone with you to the appt. to go in the exam room with you, not wait in the waiting room. Have this person take pen and paper notes of what the doctor offers you in the form of treatments, drugs, etc. Do not feel rushed to make any decisions about treatment right then. Unless you are in the midst of an emergency you should be free to go home, research it, think about it, and discuss it with your family/friends/etc. THEN make any follow up appts. necessary. Take care, Annette""I totally agree with you about using one doctor when possible to manage all your prescription meds, I have an internist who does all my meds. I see her once every three months and she gives me written RX for what I will need before I see her again. Including schedule II drugs, she just writes on them when they can be filled. I think various states and doctors have rules about prescribing meds and writing refills. If I see a specialist, he/she will send a report to my PCP and she prescribes ALL meds and manages my care after discussing it with me. Take care, Annette""Most offices have the policy posted on the wall in the waiting room somewhere. Not the best way to let patients know what the rules are about refills. I always give them about a week<APO>s notice so I don<APO>t run out of anything. I am the one that will suffer if either she or I forget. Take care, Annette""They seem to use it much like they did methadone years ago. They say it does not cause as much addiction as the older opioids do. But that is less than 2% according to all the medical studies I have read. I do not worry much about side effects with such low percentages. There is Suboxone with an anti-addiction medicine, Naloxone, incorporated in the pill, and Subutex, just the pain med by itself. The pain med in both these pills is Buprenorphine. It is classified in my drug hand book as an opioid, and is used to treat moderate to severe pain as the labeled use, and an off label use for treatment of opioid addiction. Suboxone, with naloxone in it, is used for opioid addiction or dependence treatment per this book also. I have never had the high or sense of euphoria or well being that some folks say they get from opiates. I don<APO>t think any drug is totally benign (for everyone taking it) over a lifetime of use, we will see. As a nurse and just an old person, I have seen many drugs come up and be advertised as having no side effects and being the only drug that works for a specific problem, then after a few years, it either has been proven not to be that great, or is actually recalled. Talwin was one that was used for pain. Quaalude for sleep was advertised as being totally ""non-addictive"", not true, now it is illegal in the US to even possess it. I will not switch to any meds until they have been widely used for at least five years to see if there are any side effects from longer term use. Right now I am on methadone, old, cheap and it works well for me, I will stick with it for now. Take care, Annette""A GI surgeon I saw many years ago said in my medical file that I had had my gall bladder surgically removed, not true, etc. I don<APO>t even have a scar that would be appropriate for a gall bladder removal, lol. There were several things that were inaccurate. I don<APO>t even remember HIS name now. Probably I will never find that record anywhere. It is allowable by HIPAA laws that you write a note to be included in your medical records as an addendum correcting any inaccuracies. If you think this will follow you, you might consider it. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I have not been on line for several days, I responded to your other post. Take care, Annette""Have you seen a neurologist who specializes in headaches? I think perhaps this doctor doubling to suboxone dose due to your migraines just doesn<APO>t sound right. I believe that most pain meds can cause rebound headaches which can be a worse problem than you started out with. Take care, Annette""I think you should see a regular MD so you have a primary care person now (PCP), and do not have to go looking for one in a real emergency. I personally would not go to a urgent care facility for a chronic problem, I would see a PCP. Some agree with what chiropractors do, some do not. But I think most things that reduce your need for meds are good things. I would not let a chiropractor touch my neck though, studies have shown that can be dangerous. Do not ask for pain meds specifically, just tell them what kind of pain you are having and what you have already tried. Please do not take more over the counter meds that the bottle says to without a doctor telling you to do so. You are asking for ill effects, and since it does not help much, why bother? Take care, Annette""My husband used a chiropractor off and on throughout his life, and I used one many years ago on the recommendation of my MD for lower back pain caused by a patient falling against me, and once before that for headaches that did not respond to traditional medicine, they didn<APO>t go away with the chiropractic care either. I went back to an MD for that. I won<APO>t say I am against them but, I am against them touching my neck. Studies have shown this can be dangerous and a nurse friend of mine years back suffered a stroke during a neck adjustment at her chiro<APO>s office. It was caused by the adjustment, and it took her three years of hard work to regain the use of one side of her body. No one had ever told her this was a possible side effect of the adjustment. The chiro settled with her later. My husband<APO>s chiro was an older guy, and after looking at my Xrays and an MRI of my neck told me to never let a chiro adjust my neck, and he would not do anything either. I saw a neurosurgeon at that point and had surgery on my spine. I have not been to a chiro since then. I personally would go to a different MD if traditional medicine fails. You have to do what you feel is best for you. One option is to see a osteopathic doctor (OD), they practice like regular MDs, get similar training, and many also do spinal adjustments like chiropractors do. Ask them before you make an appt. if they do adjustments or not. There are several within 10 miles of my house. Take care, Annette""If you want a doctor to respond we do have one who responds to a lot of posts. He works for WebMD, don<APO>t know if he gets paid or not, he should. Put it in the heading of your post that you would like his response, they do not always read all of the posts, this alerts him specifically. Take care, Annette""They used to tell us to rest much more than they do now. I think most people can exercise to some extent, even just walking is good for you. It may not get rid of pain, but it still has many benefits. I have FMS and read in a FMS book (written by an MD) back when I was diagnosed that I should not use my arms at a height of more than about 45 degrees from straight down because this would cause more pain. I did that for about 15 years, and probably did have less pain but I have lost so much strength in my arms that I know now it was a bad idea. I have slowly worked up the use of my arms and use weight training some for this specifically. I do not seem to have any more pain than usual in my shoulders/upper arms. I also started belly dancing to DVDs and the TV at home, I worked up to dancing every day for one hour at least. It is fun, good for me, and I have lost weight very slowly but very surely. I am down about 60 pounds from my heaviest weight. As long as I stick to one hour and do not go over that, I do not have any more pain than I did before. If I go over one hour, I do have more pain. I try hard to stick to just one hour. Find something you enjoy, or you will not exercise. I am in my 60s and just started dancing a couple of years ago. It is the only thing that has appealed to me for that length of time. Talk to your doctor before starting any exercise program. Take care, Annette""I do not personally believe that chiros do much good for most people, but it is your choice. You are having terrible pain and are more than half way through your chiropractic treatments? I would complete the treatments if possible, but then maybe rethink what is going on and how much pain you are in. Just because you may not be able to do the kind of exercise you want to do, does not mean you cannot do any kind at all. Walking is low impact for instance. I hate trampolines, too many injuries happen on them. Again, we all get to make our own choices. Take care, Annette""Chiropractors go to their own school obviously, but they do get trained for what they do. My MDs have often referred me to chirpractors back in Calif. She stated that she had already tried traditional Western Medicine without any improvement, I understand her feelings. If you look back on this thread, you already posted this stuff about chiropractors. I tend to agree with the basic thoughts, but everyone has their own choices to make. She has made hers, and I tend to agree with her this time. As long as they stay away from her neck, lol. Take care, Annette""I hope you find the answer that works for you. I have been where you are, where nothing helped and I probably did somethings I might not do otherwise (in hindsight). As long as you are sure there is nothing like a tumor going on, and you are, you should do what you think is best for you. I would still suggest avoiding chiropractic treatment on your neck though. Take care, Annette""I hate to be simplistic about a problem that you have, but just do not sit cross legged on the floor. I have not done that since I was in school, and I am 61 now. I have a really hard time getting up off the floor, so I generally do not sit on the floor. A doctor who didn<APO>t know me asked me to squat down as close to floor level as I could, I told him only if I could get up hanging on to the exam table. He was fine with that, lol. When do your legs hurt other than sitting on the floor? I generally change position about every half hour or so 24/7, now I wake up at night and turn myself over and get comfy, then fall back to sleep. At your age all I can say is lose the weight now rather than later. I am slowly doing it now, and found an exercise that I enjoy, and do it every day. Take care, Annette""Please discuss this with a doctor or a naturopathic doctor if you prefer, but someone who know about such things and can advise you properly. We got lucky, my husband<APO>s doctor went to naturopathic medical school, then got his MD after that. My husband had cancer, got well, but he hates doctors. Bad associations I guess. He got well from the cancer when he stopped going to the doctors, they gave him six months to live, that was 20 years ago. Anything more we get is just gravy. Even mild depression that requires any treatment at all should be discussed with your primary caregiver. Take care, Annette""What do all those tests and scans show? Are they all normal? Take care, Annette""Please call 911 or your local hot line for help. Take care, Annette""Xanax does not even come in 10 mg. doses, the highest dose available in oral form is far less than that, according to my drug handbook??? Take care, Annette""It didn<APO>t even show up under that name when I looked it up in my drug handbook. I do remember thorazine though, from my earlier nursing days in mental health. We used it to manage psychotic symptoms in patients. We stopped using it when drugs with a better safety profile came out. Tardive dyskenesia was tough to control with thorazine and often turned out to be permanent, even when thorazine was stopped. I would not opt to take it as a sleep aid, due to the other fairly common side effects. I have not even seen it dispensed in many years, but that varies considerably from place to place. Take care, Annette""This is a question you should ask the doctor who is treating your ulcer disease. He knows you best, what kind of ulcer you have and how well healed it is at this time. Take care, Annette""Opiates most often cause nausea through their effect at the brain level, even if you give them IV and bypass the stomach altogether, you can get nausea and vomiting. Aspirin can cause gastric bleeding directly, so it shouldn<APO>t be used by folks with ulcers. Same with other NSAIDs like ibuprofen and aleve. Over the counter meds can be deadly for some people. Take care, Annette""To add a note to your medical records to clarify something the doctor has written, read the HIPAA information that the doctor<APO>s office gave you at the beginning of your time there. Follow their instructions. I think that a typed letter with your clarification would suffice, but don<APO>t take my word for it. I have found that medical records often contain errors, but most are minor and not worth responding to. I would deal with the major ones that affect your care down the line. You might comment that this is the intent of your letter. My opinion. I believe that ""dictated not read"" means the person who transcribed and entered the note into your medical record was listening to the notes the doctor dictated into a recording device, rather than read from hand written notes by the doctor. I would ask the office for verification of this information though. Take care, Annette""Often doses of meds are incorrect, because either the doctor told you to take them differently during an appt., but did not write it down in the chart, or perhaps the patient heard it wrong. I would write the clarifications down on a separate piece of paper, and give a copy of that to the new doctor. I would not write on the original copy of the medical record. It is considered a legal document, I think. Keep copies of everything for your own records. Good luck. Take care, Annette""Talk to your doctor, perhaps he needs to adjust the dose for you, or switch you to a different medicine. I would suggest cognitive behavioral therapy for depression that often goes along with chronic pain. It worked well for me. You could also call the maker of the drug and ask them what they suggest? I got lots of info and help from drug companies. Take care, Annette""It is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. You don<APO>t necessarily need a doctor, but it helps. My therapist gave me a copy of a book about it when I moved away, and I used the book by itself. It cured my depression entirely. The book was called ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns, MD. I read the whole book through. It is a good read whether you decide on using it or not, very interesting. I opted to choose the parts of his program that struck a chord with me. Naturally, it is better to do the whole program. He has all kinds of tools you can use to track your depression/feelings. There are also lots of other articles that were cited as references. You can also opt to use it with antidepressant drugs. DO NOT taper off of any meds you are on without the advice and guidance of your doctor. Take care, Annette""My internist has treated my pain for nearly 15 years with opiates and other things. I have seen pain management specialists 2-3 times to see if they have anything to add to my plan, they have all said it is fine the way I am doing things. I am in Oregon, they just passed a law saying that information about our controlled substance use can be given to police and very few others with a warrant, Since I do everything legally I have no problem with that. Big Brother has been watching for years, just more quietly, lol. Take care, Annette""So, are you for, or against, doctors knowing about what they are prescribing, also patients? I think ""hundreds or even a thousand hours"" is an exaggeration. There are not that many pain drugs on schedule II that it would take that long. Doctors and most nurses, depending on the state, already take a certain number of hours of continuing education every year, I bet they would just use those classes instead. Take care, Annette""Hi, Gail It is so good to see you!!! Many folks have posted about RSD and I always think of you. It is far better for them to hear from someone who has dealt with it themselves. I know what you mean about pain meds and doctors. I have found from moving around to several states that geography matters, lol. Doctors here in Oregon are much easier to deal with than doctors in Calif. The ER doctors in the hospital I worked in the ER of in Nevada were easy on pain patients, they gave out meds freely and took the patient<APO>s word for it if they were in pain. That is what doctors are supposed to do in my humble opinion. That hospital ER did have the reputation of being the ""easiest"" ER in town to get opiates from. However, the state you are in and the practice the doctor belongs to, matter a lot. It may well be that the group that your doctor works in has decided on new rules, testing urine, counting pills, etc. They consider it a business decision. Your primary care doctor is in charge of your wellness, your PM doctor only manages that one symptom, use each doctor to your best advantage. My doctor joined a new practice and urine screenings for opiates is part of the deal. I know it is not me, so I refuse to take that on. So many doctors worry so much about their licenses, I understand that, I have been there. A lot of folks come to the ER and have no need of pain meds except to feed their addictions. It takes awhile to figure that out and to learn to trust your gut. I worked with a doctor once who gave a patient in the ER an emergency refill of his prescription meds that he had been on for many years, the patient overdosed and died in a local motel room within days. The doctor was so upset, I was really worried about him. It was sad all the way around, but the doctor didn<APO>t do anything wrong. A few patients like that and doctors are afraid to do anything. Hopefully, as your son gets older he will figure this whole thing out. It is SO good to see you again. Hugs, Annette""I have been very lucky, I have not experienced the""opiate bias in America"" that you have. I have lived in Nevada and Oregon since I started down this path of chronic pain and required opiates along with other treatments for my health issues. I have never had a doctor who treated me any differently due to my pain meds. I have seen several specialists for various problems since I moved to Oregon and it just has not happened to me. I do not deny that it has happened to other people. I think the ""opiate bias"" happens in certain geographical parts of the US maybe. Take care, Annette""What is this doctor<APO>s name who was innocent of everything but still lost his license? It is pretty hard to have a medical license revoked entirely, they often suspend them or say the doctor can no longer write RXs for controlled substances, but complete revocation is more difficult. I totally disagree with the county or state being able to seize anyone<APO>s property as coming from ""drug money"" before the person is convicted, but that is how it is in many areas. They changed that in my state, so I believe now they have to wait until the person is convicted to seize property. Some counties had to shut down parts of their sheriff<APO>s departments because that is how they funded them. Too bad, as far as I am concerned. In my home state a family did sue a doctor and won, for not prescribing enough pain meds for their dad while he was on a ventilator just before his death. Vote to change the laws in your area, is all I can suggest. Take care, Annette""Which states? Do you happen to know? Thanks, Swank. Take care, Annette""Yes, I believe it is the strongest opioid that can be called in on the phone. Adding another weak opiate usually is not the answer. Moving to different meds often is, along with non-drug treatments. My doctor give me RXs for three months worth of opioids at one time, three separate RXs with date to be filled written on them. I only see her once every three months. I would not go to the ER, ask the doctor who writes your current RXs to write a new one and you can take it to the pharmacy to be filled. I do not believe that chronic pain is well cared for in the ER, they are there for emergencies. Chronic pain problems are seldom emergencies. Take care, Annette""I read the article from front to back. I did have to sign in to Medscape to do so, I am a member already. Although I have never had a negative comment from MDs or RNs about my FMS diagnosis, I have heard about this problem from others. I have also met some ""FMS patients"" who have never even seen a doctor regarding this problem and do have many other health issues that might cause similar problems. They were in a support group that I never returned to... I am content with the accuracy of my own diagnosis. I took care of patients with many other problems that did not have any lab proof of their cause or even their existence in some cases. Asthma was thought to be an emotional based illness many years ago. Ulcers as mentioned were also blamed on nerves rather than a bacteria as we know now. I do not blame FMS for causing everything that some folks blame on it. I agree that some folks probably do not even have FMS, and others do. Someday we will know much more about the whole thing. Discussion is good for the art of medicine. Take care, Annette""I am sorry but I have FMS, and anti-depressants were of no help to me at all, the side effects were not tolerable either, I do not even remember most of 3-4 months of my life due to these drugs. I agree that exercise does help almost everyone feel better, but not PT, you have to find something that you love doing or you probably won<APO>t continue doing it. I have not tried the naltrexone treatment, I read the research on it when it first came out. It was not worth stopping my current meds to try it. I could not take it with them due to interactions. Since we have limited funds for research, I would vote for the money to be used to fund more serious ailments than FMS for now. Take care, Annette""Hi, Beth I read this and noted the study only included 9 women, and four visits to the doctors involved in the study. I certainly agree with the premise that exercise is good for memory and can decrease pain in some folks. My personal experiences is that I can exercise for 60 minutes daily, any more than that horribly increases my pain, no matter how slowly I increase the time. I have just accepted that for now. I have read many studies that showed that exercise and just using your brain to learn new things was good for increasing cognitive function as one aged. You are correct lots of good and interesting bits in this article, but I think lots more study might help. Thanks for the heads up on these articles. Hugs, Annette""I have chronic insomnia with my FMS and have taken Ambien nightly for about 15 years now. Thank God I have not had any problems with it, I have tried all kinds of things and they just didn<APO>t work or had severe side effects. I get about 5 hours of decent sleep most nights, makes a huge difference in my outlook on life, lol. Trazedone is an anti-depressant, it caused me huge memory gaps that never came back. I also could not get the timing right, so I was constantly hung over and groggy in the day time. Same thing happened to a friend of mine who also took it off label for sleep. We both stopped taking it due to the side effects. I took benedryl before I took RX meds, and found I had to keep increasing the dose, I was up to about 200 mg. a night, had severe dry mouth, and after awhile even that dose stopped working for me. Many of the OTC sleep aids have benedryl in them, read the labels. Diphenhydramine is the generic name for benedryl. I wish I had better news for you, but I don<APO>t. Take care, Annette""I would do a computer search of free or low cost clinics in your area. Often once you get into their system, they can find a specialist who is willing to see you either free or cheap. I found one in Florida for a friend of mine, and I am in Oregon. Take care, Annette""Also check with your county health department. Ours has a primary care clinic for people in certain situations, once you get in the clinic keeps you on the books as a patient until you tell them to drop you, or you stop showing up. Not all counties do this, in Calif, and NV where I lived previously, they didn<APO>t have this option at all. Good luck. Take care, Annette""Just to clarify...folks who are approved for SSDI (Social Security Disability Insurance) claims are also approved for Medicare, but not until two years after your date of disability. God help you until then, the government doesn<APO>t, unless you are really poor and can get Medicaid. Even on just SSDI, it gives me too much income to get Medicaid. I do get Medicare now. Your SSDI check varies depending on how much money you made while you were working and paying into Social Security. Medicare is the health program for seniors and the disabled and you get it based on age and disability status per Social Security regulations. Medicaid is the state/federal health program for the very poor. That includes income and what you might already own. Take care, Annette""What did the doctor say about this pain? Has he xrayed your feet? Could you have stress fractures or something related due to jumping from a height of four feet? It may have nothing to do with your chronic illnesses or it might be related. Have you seen a podiatrist? Take care, Annette""So, it is good to ask your parents and friends, but I vote for what the doctors told you after seeing the ultrasound results. If the ultrasound said nothing is structurally wrong, then try the ibuprofen and TIME. Unless the pain level starts going up rather than the same or less, I think watchful waiting is in order. Did the doctor tell you how long he expected the pain to last and you to require ibuprofen? I would always ask that question, how long should I have symptoms and not need to worry, when exactly should I come back or see the doctor I am referred to? When you had testicular torsion in both testes in 2/11 did they do surgery? Did you see a urologist or some other specialist after being seen by the ER doctor? Testicular torsion is considered an emergency and surgery is usually done immediately to prevent the involved testicle from dying. Have your folks look on the ER discharge sheet you were given, there should be a doctor<APO>s name and number for referral purposes if you don<APO>t have a family doctor. I have never heard of growing pains in the testicles... Take care, Annette""Hi, Bren<UD>Bren How is the prolotherapy going? I have not heard of this problem, it sounds like another excuse to get people off of opioids to me. But, let me know what you find out, and if the prolotherapy works for you. I have been on opioids daily for about 14-15 years now, I never catch anything contagious, and had surgery last year without the surgeon mentioning this problem with opioids. I healed up fine after the surgery, no problems at all. About 20 years ago my neurosurgeon warned me about smoking and the effects that had on healing, in fact he refused to do surgery on smokers. I know you would be able to tell by checking your breakthrough meds and how often you need them if the treatment were working to decrease your pain. You could also taper off of the long acting opioid if you were having less pain. I do not know why or how the opioids would suppress the immune system and prevent the prolotherapy from working. You know that I don<APO>t really believe in prolotherapy anyway, but these are not subjective things, did you ask the doctor who is giving you prolotherapy for studies to show what he believes to be true about the immune system and opioids? I thought you started prolotherapy a long time ago, when did they ask you to get off of opioids? If they asked before you started prolotherapy, that would be one thing, if they asked you to get off of them later on after you had had a lot of prolotherapy treatments, that could mean something else. Keep in touch. Hugs, Annette""Finding stuff to support his opinion in a book he wrote, sounds strange to me. It is like the video of him telling us his opinion. If it is so clearly fact and it has been determined by evidence based research, you should not have to ""dig deep"" to find this info. A simple search on Medscape or some other medical search engine should turn it up for you. If those PM docs don<APO>t answer your questions, perhaps it is because they do not know the answers. Take care, Annette""Hi, Beth I went to the second article you posted and read the abstract of the study, it was also based on rats only, and seemed to vary from drug to drug. Interesting, but it seemed to me like it only meant that more research was in order. Thanks for the links. Hugs, Annette""Hi again, Beth The article was dated as published in 2006, so more research might have been done since then. Hugs, Annette""In rats or humans, in the 1990s? The studies Beth posted links to were done on rats only. Do you happen to have any links to this research? If not, I can Google it myself. Thanks, Annette""We are both fine, we saw our doctors last week & adjusted meds, etc. Just a tune up. I have not read any studies like you describe, I would ask the doctor who told you about it to provide you with links to support his statements. Birth control pills simulate pregnancy, that is how they prevent conception. I don<APO>t understand how artificially taking hormones to simulate pregnancy puts your ""body pack in balance"" hormonally? I would never put a number of days as an absolute for tapering anyone off of fentanyl, or other opiates for that matter. We are all different. Can you do it in 60 days, probably so. Will you have withdrawal symptoms, don<APO>t know, you will find out though, lol. My husband came off of morphine once on his own, and methadone twice with no withdrawal symptoms at all. I was present for the methadone tapers as I did them myself (his doctor told me I could as an RN with previous methadone tapering experience). I did it faster than 60 days, but it is a slightly different drug, and he was not having withdrawal symptoms, or I would have stretched it out. I think God helps those who help themselves. If you believe in your doctors and the treatments they offer, I believe you will do fine. If that is the placebo effect, that is fine with me. I really advise everyone read ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"" by Dr. Margaret A. Caudill, MD, PHD. It is a great book for managing any kind of chronic pain. Take care, Annette""First, I would not even bother with prolotherapy, so I wouldn<APO>t be in your shoes, that said, I will try and fill in the blanks as best I can. The DEA does not forbid the use of oxycodone 15 mgs, my pharmacy has been unable to get a hold of those for as long as I have been on them (more than a year) and they substitute 5 mg. tablets instead and adjust the instructions. If your doctor can no longer write for them, I would question him carefully, if the DEA has ""forbidden"" him from prescribing them, they might take away his narcotic prescribing privileges altogether. It must be for some reason. Only you can decide what to do, as far as all these things they they tell you. I would ask them for links to ""evidence based medical research"" that shows what they say is true, or even plausible. At least you can read and see where they are coming from. If hormone therapy to make an unpregnant female, you, feel pregnant so you have less pain is fine, why is taking opioids wrong? Or less natural? I just do not understand their reasoning. I really think one should use many tools to feel better, but only you can decide for yourself which ones to use. Keep in touch. Good luck, Annette""Your wife needs to ask her own doctor what to take for pain. If her PA is gone on vacation, there should be someone taking call for him. Take care, Annette""I have read medical studies that showed less tolerance with long acting opiates than with short acting opiates. I think the rotation of opiates depends on the doctor and patient<APO>s preferences. I do not think a monthly rotation is necessary though. I have read of doctors doing this when a patient<APO>s daily opioid dose seems too high and they want to rotate to a new opioid to find a lower dose. I do not know of any evidence based studies to support this, but perhaps someone else does??? Lots of doctors seem to do it, according to this site anyway. Take care, Annette""If you have only taken her twice in two years to the doctor, I am glad you are going next week. Please keep after this until they figure it out. It may take going to her pcp, then to an orthopedic specialist or a for specialist, please do not give up. I would take this time before the appt. to write down what tests, opinions if any have already been done or given to you, and a time line with her symptoms, severity, etc. on it. I would let the doctor decide what tests to run, not go in with a preconceived notion of what he should do. Let us know how things go. Take care, Annette""Plantar fasciitis usually resolves with the treatment you described. Please take your child to an appropriate specialist if it doesn<APO>t. Find out exactly what she has and what she needs to do to get well. Did your doctor say how long it should be before her pain improves? Ask him if he didn<APO>t, so you know when to start worrying. Take care, Annette""If anyone has any real, evidence-based, medical studies that show that a particular opiate is more addictive than others, I would be really interested in reading them. The last time I did a search and looked, all the opiates were about the same in addictive qualities and other side effects according to studies done on them. There were not a whole lot of studies done. If the ER version of this hydrocodone is made so that it cannot be easily abused, then I doubt that it is any different in its addictive qualities than other long acting opiates that are already available. Any new formula can be a good thing to have as a tool for chronic pain treatment. Please keep in mind that addiction only happens in about 1% of those who use opiates per their doctors instructions (not counting illegal use). It is a small but important side effect. Take care, Annette""You can take things like over the counter acetaminophen or ibuprofen/naprosyn type drugs. They can also use injectible numbing meds at the time of surgery. What is your problem with narcotics? Take care, Annette""We have ODs here in addition to MDs, I think they are pretty much interchangable. Some do adjustments some don<APO>t. Ask up front before you make an appt. Take care, Annette""It is always okay to refuse any treatment that you do not feel comfortable with. Don<APO>t feel stupid, you aren<APO>t. Take care, Annette""You need to find a way to see a doctor. Many communities have free or low cost clinics, but you have to seek them out, they don<APO>t usually have the money to advertise. Call Goodwill, Salvation Army, Catholic Charities, etc. and ask what is available in your community. You might also call your county health services, they might be able to help you. Our community got some of the economic stimulus money and is using part of it to beef up the primary care clinic in our county health department. RLS can present with many different kinds of pain in all parts of your body, but you cannot diagnose yourself on line. There are other illnesses that present with chronic pain. You need to actually see a doctor. Take care, Annette""If you are having abdominal migraines, it may well take at least a year to find a medicine program that works. Stop going to the ER and find one good doctor to manage you. One that you like is best. First you try one migraine preventative for 4-6 weeks, then you try another one, you keep at that until you run out of meds to try, then you do them in pairs the same way. Ditto with rescue meds. It can take forever, but it is worth it in the end. By the way opiates in general do not work well for migraine type pain, they cause rebound migraines. Take care, Annette""Ask your doctor what he knows about this. I take methadone also, but at a much smaller dose than you do. I have read that cardiac side effects start at around 60 mg. per day, but they are rare. Never, ever try dosing yourself, or taking extra if it does not work any more, that is how people die. I would be more concerned that I would have difficulty finding another doctor to manage my meds if my dose got too high. Take care, Annette""Thanks, Dr. Maine. I do get yearly EKGs, even on the low dose I take, 20 mg./day. Take care, Annette""Try a different doctor, there are treatments for RA that may significantly reduce your pain from both that and FMS. Did you go back to the rheumy and tell him that the tramadol isn<APO>t helping, and see what he says?? Take care, Annette""Find a different doctor, maybe at a university medical school. There is a diagnosis for what you have, you may find a treatment that actually fixes it instead of just treating the symptoms. Take care, Annette""I flew from Reno to SF to be seen at the neurology clinic there, then flew home. Find a ride if you must. Take care, Annette""Back when I was on Norco (generic), I would get a RX with my check up, or call the pharmacy at least one week in advance, and tell the pharmacy exactly when I would run out. They called the doctor. I never had any problems that way. But each doctor varies, ask your doctor next time you see him what he would prefer you do. Take care, Annette""You are right, you are on very high doses of narcotics. AND you were once a heroin addict, of course, it will be difficult to find a doctor to manage your pain meds for you. You knew what you were taking and now you must try something else, it is naturally scary. It might be advisable to see an addictions therapist along with a pain management specialist. What are you currently doing about your addiction problem? Have the doctors told you why they do not want to try methadone? Are you aware that enough methadone to cover what you are taking might cause heart conduction problems? Maybe this is why the doctors want to go to suboxone instead. I don<APO>t know, you will have to ask them. I suspect they have a reason, just ask. I have read that taking two long acting opiates is a no-no in drug treatment for chronic pain. Perhaps, opiates won<APO>t help you with your pain, no matter what the dose??? Keep in touch, let us know how you are doing. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I don<APO>t believe you. I have never heard of this happening before. Can you please post a link or a study that shows what you say to be true? I would be happy to go read it. Take care, Annette""I said you were a heroin addict only because you said that yourself. I have worked with heroin addicts in the past and it is a difficult place to come back from. You are four years clean, so keep it that way. You cannot use your pain as an excuse to use injected heroin. I think you need to see an addictions specialist in addition to a pain specialist. You said that your parents control your meds, that tells me that your addiction is still an issue. Some pain clinics have addiction specialists as part of their team, ideally, this might be your best choice. There is no way to know whether or not you will have pain or how much doing an inpatient detox. Give it a try, you can always quit and go home if it doesn<APO>t work out. If the new doctor is used to working with suboxone, give it a shot. Once you are his patient if it doesn<APO>t work out perhaps he will change you to something else. I would be open to trying the suboxone and see what happens. I do not really think it matters much what pain med you are on, but rather the dosing of the drug. If the doctor is used to using suboxone, it may be better to try it and see where it leads you. It may be that the last time you used it, the dose was wrong, or you did not wait out the side effects long enough. Many side effects go away in time, do you remember what the side effects were? Or did it just not seem to relieve your pain? Even switching to methadone, you might still need to lower your total opioid level. Again, opiates may not be the answer to your pain at all, lease be open to that too. Don<APO>t even worry about a girlfriend at this point, one will come along when you least expect it. Take care, Annette""I have used both gabapentin and Lyrica, I can tell the difference, and gabapentin works best for me. So I continue to use it. I do not take Lyrica anymore. The gabapentin does help with my neurologically based pain, and migraines, and sleep disorder RLS. I agree there probably isn<APO>t much point in using both of them at one time. Using your mind to overcome things is a great idea. I use cognitive behavioural therapy techniques to control my chronic pain. Take care, Annette""This person is on fentanyl patches and oxycontin, both LONG acting opiates, there is no reason to believe he is going into withdrawal during the night, if the only short acting opiate he is using is the roxycodone he mentioned. Take care, Annette""In plain English it means you had a broken (fracture) T12 (thoracic=lower chest level) vertebrae (bone in your spine). You also broke the top (plateau) of the main lower leg bone (tibia) of your left leg, this is the lower part of the knee joint. You had a broken bone in your left hand below your pinky finger (fifth metacarpal) that came through the skin (open fracture). A deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus means you had a blood vessel blockage in a deep vein and one in your lung. No way of knowing from your post how severe those were. Occasionally, they are not blood clots, but are fatty emboli, small globs of fat from inside the broken bones that escape into your blood vessels. But, usually this refers to blood clots. Often you get a blood clot in your leg, and a small piece of it pulls off and travels to your lung. Since you had those 20 years ago and seemed to heal well, it is difficult to tell how much those injuries are contributing to your present problem. All old injuries have the potential to come back and hit you as arthritis or cause chronic pain later in life, but you could also develop joint and back problems as you age, that have nothing to do with the old injuries. I personally don<APO>t care much why I have my present pain, I am more interested in dealing with it so I can live life and enjoy things. Let this doctor get to know you better, he may come through with pain meds once he has a chance to get to know and trust you. If he doesn<APO>t feel comfortable prescribing pain meds after several visits, you can ask him if he would refer you to a pain management specialist. He may do diagnostic tests that will help determine what is causing your pain so you can treat it properly, but accept that you may never know just what the cause is. One often has to just keep trying different treatments until one figures out what will work best. Try a hot tub, I find that relaxes all my muscles and I sleep better. A heating pad only covers a very small area. Never sit or lay on top of the heating pad, that is how people get severe burns on their skins. Heating pads are meant to lay on top of you, not under you. I also found cognitive behavioral therapy to be very useful. Be sure to let this new doctor know that you are willing to try whatever non-invasive treatments he can come up with that you have not already tried and failed with. Take care, Annette""I had acupuncture for chronic pain, it was covered by my insurance. I had no improvement at all. My family practice pcp said in his experience people usually got about three months of relief, then the pain returned. That was a long time ago. Take care, Annette""Like the doctor said, first get her a pacemaker. Lots of different things can cause heart problems, certainly the stress of a surgery. Meanwhile get a second opinion for her pain management and further back/neck surgery. There are specialists in Pain Management, get one of them to check out her pain. Take care, Annette""A-fib is atrial fibrillation, the two upper chambers of the heart do not beat in proper sequence anymore. A pacemaker sends electrical impulses that the heart muscle responds to, so that they do pump properly. This problem can cause emboli (blood clots) that may be a problem at some time. The emboli result from blood pooling in the atria. Take care, Annette""I am not sure who you are or what procedures are needed. There are medications that you can take for A-fib. Talk honestly to the doctor about any financial problems. Take care, Annette""It takes about a year for your body to heal from any surgery. Just call your surgeon<APO>s office for an appt. or mention it when you see him next. Of course, it might still heal up and the pain go away, or not. Wait and see. Take care, Annette""Maybe, you were not a candidate for surgery at all? No one wants to hear there is no good choice for treatment for them, but that is the truth for some people. There may be in the future, but perhaps not at this time. Take care, Annette""Well said. I feel the same way. Take care, Annette""I have read several posts that said it was against the law in Florida for doctors other than pain management doctors to prescribe opioids of any kind for chronic pain patients. I have a close friend in Florida and asked her yesterday what the deal was. She said she didn<APO>t know because her PCP prescribed her opiates and her husband<APO>s arthritis doctor prescribed his. Both are for long standing chronic pain problems. Neither she nor her husband are terminal or anything like that. Each doctor may decide for himself that he will not prescribe opiates, but it apparently has nothing to do with the legalities. Take care, Annette""Read my post above to LadyofHouston. Take care, Annette""Don<APO>t feel frustrated, it takes time to make a diagnosis, or not. Knees are complicated joints, it often takes time to figure things out. They never did figure mine out. Maybe it was the FMS that caused most of the pain, it certainly increases the pain. I had knee pain/swelling about 12 years ago and about 7 years ago. The first time I saw my rheumy and he examined me and sent me for an xray. He said it looked okay to him and offered to send me to an ortho guy he knew. I said lets wait and see because with FMS all oain seems worse and takes longer to heal. The pain went away by itself after about 8 weeks. The second time, 5 years later, same thing, pain and some swelling. I saw my internal medicine doctor and asked for and got a short course of oral steroids, which I followed with NSAIDs, and made an appt. to see the ortho guy. When I saw him, I had new xrays, and had received the old ones from the rheumy in another city. He compared them and said no significant change, I saw the same thing. He laid out what he would suggest I do as far as an MRI, look-see surgery, etc. I told him if it wasn<APO>t better in 8 more weeks, I would come back. He was fine with that, and said that FMS can complicate the picture as it can increase pain. But, it got completely better, and has remained so. I am so glad I did not have any surgery, etc. I did use my cane until I could walk without it. I currently exercise an hour a day, I belly dance along with TV-DVD videos, plus weights for about ten minutes. I have lost about sixty pounds now, very slowly, a few pounds every three months when I see my doctor. Find an exercise routine that you really enjoy, that is the key to keeping it up. I don<APO>t diet at all. My husband teases me about my ice cream and M&M diet, lol. If you need to lose weight, do it but be sensible about it. A class I went to said if you decrease your calories by 100 calories eaten, and 100 more calories used, you will lose about a pound a week. 100 calories is like one cookie or one piece of bread, we can all do that. 100 calories is easy to use up too, try walking/swimming every day as long as your doctor has okayed it for you. Take care, Annette""I am 61, pain should never be considered just a part of aging, it isn<APO>t. Go see your doctor. Take care, Annette""ER doctors really mostly check you over for dangerous things like a stroke or heart attack. Then when they rule that out, they treat your immediate symptoms and refer you to your family doctor or a specialist for further care. Chronic headaches are often either migraines or sinus related headaches. They could also be tension headaches since you specifically mention anxiety and clenching your jaw. Your bad teeth could also be contributing to your problem. The CT scan is usually done to check for anything really bad in you head, like a tumor or blood vessel abnormality. It is a good thing that it was negative. I would pick a neurologist that deals with headaches and stick with him for awhile. It may take several different treatment attempts to figure out what the problem is. Take care, Annette""Just ask him first, then you will know how he will react. Many doctors might have a problems with opiates and amphetamines. Take care, Annette""I would see an ENT doctor about your recurring colds, perhaps you have a sinus infection or something else going on that never completely goes away. It is not normal. Do you have Chronic Fatigue Immune Deficiency Syndrome or are you tired all the time (chronically fatigued)? There is a huge difference. I am tired most of the time, but I do not have CFIDS. I have FMS primarily. If you have CFIDS, ignore most of my post. My internist manages all my FMS problems, migraines, chronic pain, etc. (otherwise I am pretty darn healthy), and she treats the pain that I get with more opioids than vicodin at this point in my life. I take neurontin 800 mg. a day all at one time, and zolpidem nightly for sleep. I also take multi-vitamins, Vit. D, and over the counter bowel meds for constipation as needed. For opioids I take methadone 5 mg. twice a day and 10 mg. at bedtime. I also use oxycodone 15 mg. every 4-6 hours as needed for breakthrough pain. I usually take it 2-4 times a day. I don<APO>t take anti-depressants because I have had a bad reaction to most of them. They help many people with chronic pain, not just depression. My husband took them for several years, until he was able to get his hip replaced. They really helped him a lot. They are also useful in treating FMS for many people. Other than meds, I plan my days carefully so I don<APO>t over do it. I plan days of rest, after days of activity. I know what you are talking about the day after you play tennis. I love my hot tub and use it daily just before I go to bed, whether I want to or not. I exercise for a minimum of 60 min. a day, weights for about ten minutes, every day. Any more than that, and I hurt a lot more. I even write it all down as far as meds, and exercise goes. Otherwise I would make some excuse not to do it. Figure out a plan and stick with it, you will be okay. Talk to your doctor. Read a book called, ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"" by Dr. Margaret A. Caudill, MD, PhD. It is great for any of us living with chronic pain. Take care, Annette""Me too. I have also occasionally cut back on my pain meds and have found the same thing as CTBeth. We are also both disabled RNs. What kind of healthcare professional are you, An<UD>245033? I am curious where you fit into the medical community. Have you read about the difference between addiction and dependence? It rarely takes ""months to go through the pain of withdrawal"" with opiates. Where exactly are you getting this information? Take care, Annette""I feel really bad for the addict who also has chronic pain to deal with. I think the pain management clinics that have addiction specialists to help with these patients are the best option. Take care, Annette""Yes, I have personally had good experiences with opiate medications that I take for chronic pain. I have used them for years now, never gotten high, only side effect I have is constipation. I am an RN, with three or four years of experience in a methadone clinic for opiate addiction back in the early 1970s, followed by years of experience in various hospital settings, mostly ICUs and ERs. Since my disability I worked shortly for a home health agency, and then volunteered at a free clinic for nine years and now at our local animal shelter. What exactly is your experience? How long have you worked as an ""addictions specialist""? What does one have to do to get certified in that area as far as education? What types of facilities have you worked in? It is entirely your choice whether you opt to explain yourself any further or not. Take care, Annette""Please stay and offer us your advice based on your own experience. I am nearly 63 years old, and have been on daily opiates for about 15 years of that time. Like you, for me they make life so much better. If our natural pain mechanisms are inadequate to take care of my pain, I am glad to have opiate type drugs to turn to. Take care of yourself, Annette""Well put. I tend to agree with your last sentence more than anything else. ""To each his own"", everyone must make their own decisions about medical stuff. My personal opinion is that Suboxone is the latest methadone, we will see after it has been around as long as methadone has. Then we might know what its side effect profile and safety rate really are. Take care, Annette""Excuse me, but you work in a rapid detox clinic. How much experience do you have with patients on a continuing basis, for weeks and months, or even years? My understanding of rapid detox clinics is that they sedate patients with anesthetic agents, and then reverse the opioids in their system, then allow them to wake up and discharge them. It is like a day surgery. What is your working title? Are you a doctor, a nurse? You have repeatedly stated that you work in a detox clinic, but have never said exactly what it is that you do. Hyperalgesia is a fairly rare condition according to all the literature on the subject that I have found. If you have access to links of evidence-based medical studies regarding this problem, I would love to have them so I can read them at my leisure. Since few people have FMS by itself, but usually have co-morbid conditions it is rather difficult to say exactly what is causing their pain. Is it better to let them live in pain or to treat it? I certainly do not think opioids should be first line treatments for chronic pain, but they are one tool that we have access to, why not use them along with other treatments? Take care, Annette""Toradol is an NSAID and has a warning that it should never be used for longer than 5 days. It is often used for single dose treatment of acute pain, but seldom to never for chronic pain. Take care, Annette""Why do you not want to take narcotics as opposed to other types of meds? There are other options out there, NSAIDs, Lidoderm pathces, antidepressants, anti-seizure meds, etc., but they all have their own risks. I think it is best to discuss all your concerns with your doctor. Take care, Annette""I did read your other post, and I understand that tramadol is one kind of drug and toradol is another kind. If the original poster requires chronic treatment, then toradol is not an option. That was the only point I was making. It is not generally used for chronic pain. Take care, Annette""How old are you, if you don<APO>t mind saying? What does your doctor suggest? Take care, Annette""Yikes!!! I have never heard of chronic pain caused by DIC. But, then I never had a patient survive DIC in the ICU, it was a long time ago, a different age by medical standards, 20-30 years ago. I went to the article you provided a link for and they did mention ""chronic DIC"" briefly, but did not mention pain as a symptom. Is the information you gave from personal experience or from your reading/training? If you have other links, I would be appreciative. My vet told me once that she managed to save a dog one time in her long practice who went into DIC after tylenol poisoning. I was impressed. Thanks again for your invaluable information. Take care, Annette""You are right, HELLP Syndrome is a very scary OB problem. I have not worked in OB since 1973 or so, it has been a long time. I worked in ICU after that and unfortunately became fairly comfortable dealing with DIC. Thanks again for your input. Take care, Annette""I am glad they worked for you, like everything they do not help everyone. Take care, Annette""Shirley1001, Sorry, I do not understand what you are talking about. I currently take methadone for chronic pain, I had surgery in January 2011, and had no problems using ""opioids"" for pain after surgery. I currently use oxycodone for breakthrough pain, it works just fine. Methadone is an opioid analgesic , but is not an opiate. Opioid and opiate are two terms that people throw around without always knowing how to use the terms properly. Look them up in a medical dictionary for precise definitions. Methadone was created for use in treating pain during WWII by the Germans when they had short supplies of morphine. Over 40 years ago, in nursing school, I used methadone for patients in pain due to terminal illness. After graduation when I worked in a heroin addiction treatment center I gave it to heroin addicts seeking treatment, with a doctor<APO>s order of course. The dosing, and timing of each dose of methadone is somewhat different for pain and addiction. Buprenorphine, Subutex, is a completely different drug with which I have no personal experience. However, it is also FDA approved for both pain management, and addiction treatment, according to my drug handbook for advanced practice nurses. Before making the decision to use marijuana for pain, please keep in mind that federal law makes it illegal in all 50 states in the US. Federal law trumps state laws. I tried pot many years ago and found it really did no good anyway for the chronic pain I have. My doctors here in Oregon where it is approved for medical use, all told me at the time to try whatever I wished, but to use it and anything else I tried ""in moderation"". Whatever that means. I would not risk my proven-to-work drugs on smoking pot, my choice. Everyone must make their own choice. Take care, Annette""Subutex is approved for use as an injection for moderate to severe pain, and the oral tablets are used for addiction, per the handbook I mentioned. Keep in mind that once a drug is approved by the FDA for use, the doctors can use it in any dose or for any use they see fit, not just what it was approved for. That is called off-label prescribing. Take care, Annette""As far as medical marijuana goes, please everyone remember that it is against federal law in ALL states. Federal law trumps state law. Be very careful and keep your mouth shut about using it. It does not work for everyone for chronic pain. Take care, Annette""Sorry, RX opiate drug addiction may cause many problems, but I got the same info as Dave did in my nursing journal last year or maybe the year before, less than 1% of the people who used opiates as prescribed by their doctors became addicted to them. Stop and think how may opiates prescriptions are written each year for both acute and chronic pain. This is not an unreasonable number. The article in my journal had a bibliography of studies to support it, as did another quoted by Charles on this message board. I checked them both out online and they seemed valid to me. I have not found any bibliographies attached to written or TV news shows. When I have tried to track them down by calling the reporter who wrote the article in the news, as often as not he says he just ""read it somewhere"". Also please remember that the number of folks who become drug addicts is far different than the number of folks who die due to overdoses or other drug side effects. You do not have to be a drug addict to die of an OD. That is comparing apples and oranges. Good to see you, Chel. Take care, Annette""It is early Monday morning, and my email digests have not come back on yet. When will it happen? Take care, Annette""Thanks. I got all but the FMS Board and Joint Replacement Board, I will redo my email digest choices, sometimes that triggers a reaction. Take care, Annette""CBT is great!!! I learned about it many years ago, and it cured my depression. It also works for anxiety and many other emotional and mind-body problems. I would also suggest reading, ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"", by Dr. Margaret A. Caudill, MD, PhD. If you have never tried it, and are not interested at all, I think your pain is probably not bad enough yet. Why not try anything that is totally non-invasive, and side effect free? It is a life long commitment, but once you learn the basic precepts thoroughly they become part of your way of living. Take care, Annette""Call your doctor and make an appt. for a real evaluation. Take care, Annette""Talk to your state nursing board, the rules about chronic pain patients taking opiates during working hours has changed in many states over the last 5-10 years. I have been an RN for over 40 years now, presently retired but still licensed, due to a disability. You might also try Lidoderm patches, they are pricey, but work well for some types of pain. Take care, Annette""I have had sciatica twice, many years ago, both times it healed fine with prednisone taken orally for a week or so. Both times from bad IM injections given by the same nurse. I have FMS also. My husband<APO>s cancer doc said ""numbness is better than pain"" 25 years ago when my husband noted a place on his thigh that was numb and mentioned it to the doctor. He (my husband) is still alive, and the cancer went away long before the numbness did. We all get different stuff wrong with us, for different reasons. Please go see your doctor. Best of luck. Take care, Annette""Please see a doctor as soon as you can. You are on fairly high doses of meds and withdrawal will start as soon as you run out of meds. It would be best to have a good doctor to oversee your care. The suggestion to go to the Cleveland Clinic is one option. Take care, Annette""Chronic pain is also a medical condition, sometimes chronic opioid use is indicated for treatment along with other approaches. I look at dependence as a side effect of using opioids rather than as a medical condition requiring treatment. If one is having other side effects that make opioid use ineffective or intolerable, just taper off the opioids under a doctor<APO>s supervision. Take care, Annette""How much does your clinic charge patients without health insurance? Is this paid up front, or do they accept payment plans? Unfortunately, money is a huge problem when it comes to accessing our health care system. This is not your fault personally, it just is a problem. I do believe that rapid detox works fine for getting opiates out of the body, it does not treat addiction or any underlying medical problem that causes chronic pain. It is not meant to. So, in the sense of ridding the body of opiates, we agree, it is successful. I do feel that addicts need further treatment and so do folks with chronic pain. I do not know if we agree on this or not. Take care, Annette""Good for you!!! Anyone who wants to get off of pain meds should do it and then see what the deal really is. Staying off of them for awhile will at least lower your tolerance completely so you can start off at a much lower dose, if you ever need them again. I think it is good to keep an open mind about using them. If you need them, fine, if not that is fine too. My husband went off of methadone and oxycodone with no withdrawal at all, every one is different and you never know what your own withdrawal experience will be like. Keep in touch and let us know how you are doing. Take care, Annette""Rapid opioid detox was about $10,000 the last time I checked. According to a TV news program, the care is not always top notch, be very careful when you opt for this. She will still need a pain management specialist when she gets done with detox. Take care, Annette""My therapist back in Reno did phone appts. It was a good idea, not for all the time, but occasionally. You might suggest this to him. Take care, Annette""Please talk to your doctor about this right away. I would consider it urgent. I take oxycodone 15-20 mg. as needed, as a BT pain med. I get 5 mg. pills and need to take three or four of them at a time. This is all that is available in my area at this time. There is no acetaminophen in the pills at all. Take care, Annette""The problems with Demerol seem to be unrelated to how often one takes it. There are so many other meds available, I don<APO>t use it at all any more. I have a long history of migraines, and opiates are not indicated as a first line therapy. They can cause rebound headaches, that scares me more than the migraines do, lol. Take care, Annette""We would all like to be healthy, happy, and pain free. We would all like to be able to work. Meanwhile, check out SSDI, and see if it might help you. You get Medicare after two years, that might help also. Thank goodness, gabapentin works better for me than lyrica. Take care, Annette""Talk to your doctor and see what he suggests. I have been on daily opiate therapy for nearly 15 years, certainly I am dependent on the opiates, and will go through withdrawal if I stop taking them all of a sudden. However, if I decided with my doctor that I should go off of them, I would slowly taper them down to minimize or eliminate withdrawal symptoms. A lot of folks who say they are allergic to a drug actually get side effects, talk to your doctor, tell him exactly what happened when you took drugs in the past. Let us know what happens at the pain management appt. I hope you learn how to feel better. Take care, Annette""Talk to your nurse P.C. and let her know that your pain is not being managed properly. Compression fractures of the spine are very painful for awhile while they heal. Follow their instructions as best you can, wear whatever brace they give you as instructed, and let her know how your pain goes. If you don<APO>t tell her, she assumes that everything is okay. You will probably not be pain-free, but it should be controlled enough that you can take proper care of yourself. Take care, Annette""Compression fractures that are over 9 years old are probably healed. There may or may not be better meds available for arthritis of the spine. When you see the pain specialist on the 14th you can discuss this with him. Good luck to you. Take care, Annette""I think it varies from person to person. My husband was on it at one time for chronic pain, and when he went off of it after he had his surgery, he had no withdrawal symptoms at all. Take care, Annette""Why you decide to have surgery is relevant as far as expectations go. I have found as a nurse and as a patient, that expectations affect how well you do post op. I do not know if this was in the mind of the person who asked or not. That said, we do not know from the original poster that she did have an ""upsizing"", poor choice of words but not mine. For all we know she did have cancer and had to have implants to stay the same size as she was. I had breast reduction surgery which is totally different from the surgery she had. I wanted to reduce my back pain and other problems. It did all of that, and I have a nice chest. It has been just over a year for me, and I still have some incisional pain in certain positions with certain clothing on. I did not respond to her post because our surgeries were so different. To everyone out there, these are totally different surgeries with totally different expectations and outcomes. Just because their incisions might be in the same area (might not be) doesn<APO>t mean they have had the same surgery. Also, I agreed with the poster who told her to talk to her surgeon. He/she is the one with the answers for her. We do not know just when she had her surgery, this might be normal post op pain, might not be. I also hope she spoke with her surgeon. Take care, Annette""I strongly recommend cognitive behavioural therapy. You can learn this from a book of a psychotherapist. It is often used to help manage many kinds of chronic pain. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""An<UD>245374, I have a long history of migraines, and the one of the few things I could think of that would be worse is rebound headaches. My neurologist took a detailed history and checked the timing of my migraines and when I took hydrocodone for other chronic pain and told me they were not rebound headaches. I have continued with taking opiates and the migraines decreased after menopause and with using other drug treatment. Keep in mind that all pain meds, either opiate or non-opiate, RX or over-the-counter, can cause rebound headaches, as can triptan medications like Imitrex. Be very careful, as they can be very difficult and painful to treat. Take care, Annette""Hi, sorry to barge in here, but it is not the diagnosis that you have it is the level of impairment that you have that determines whether or not you are eligible for SSDI. A friend of mine has had one knee replaced due to arthritis, and has it throughout her body it seems, she still works. Her partner does not work due to a psychiatric condition, she is on disability. We are all different. If you find yourself unable to work at all, then apply for disability, you will probably know when that day comes. Take care, Annette""When I switched over to Medicare as my health insurance, I was terrified of hitting the donut hole because then I really could not afford to buy food and meds, lol. I did the research myself and asked my doctor to change me over to methadone (about $20-30 a month) as my long acting pain med, with plain generic oxycodone for breakthrough pain. I avoid name brand meds at all costs anyway, as they are much more expensive than generic meds. I have used many kinds of generics and have never noticed any difference at all. They all work fine for me. All of my meds are generic now. I only take two or three other RX meds regularly so it has worked out for me so far. I have never hit the donut hole so far, knock on wood. Talk to your doctor, take your insurance company formulary with you, and ask him to pick the cheapest drugs that he thinks will work for your type of pain. Start there and work your way slowly up expense wise. Plan ahead!!! Try out the special $4 per month drugs if possible at WalMart. Call the companies that make your drugs, some of them have special programs where you can get your drugs free or at lower cost. Costco has cheap RX drugs and you do NOT have to be a member to use their pharmacy. Call around to different pharmacies if possible and shop around, you would be shocked at the different prices for the same drugs. Take care, Annette""I have used methadone for 2-3 years now, and it works fine for me. It was developed for pain in Germany during WWII, it is an old drug. There are no head to head, double blind studies that I am aware of that show any one opioid or opiate is better than another for treating pain or causing side effects. I do not trust drug companies at all, they are in it for the money. Look into independent research. Take care, Annette""Smart of you to pick this health coverage. Is it very expensive? Take care, Annette""I personally believe that any surgical procedure used to manage chronic pain should only be used when all other non-invasive treatments fail. I find this to be true about most medical situations. They also all require some followup, and who knows what ones medical insurance will be in the future. I personally have not had either, and continue to use opiates and other non-opiate therapies for my chronic pain over the last 15 years or so. Take care, Annette""Don<APO>t worry about spelling my name right, I knew you were talking to me. I think the implanted devices may work well for select patients, but I am not convinced we know how to select the patients. Sometimes we just get lucky. Take care, Annette""Hot soaks in a tub or a hot shower really helps me with any kind of stiffness. Best of luck. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know what to say. You waited until the last couple of days of your meds to post, and then the boards were read only for a couple of days, so I couldn<APO>t reply. I would do the reduced doses of pain meds for now, and ask them to refer you to someone else for pain management. My husband was tapered off of methadone and percocet without any withdrawals, but your pain would come back as your dose went down if your pain condition remains the same as it was when you started. While you are tapered down, you should at least avoid withdrawals, then you can find another doctor. I can<APO>t guarantee you would get pain meds at the level you want, that is between you and the doctor. I don<APO>t know who told you that you weren<APO>t allowed to talk about your pain as that was ""negative"", I believe that to a certain extent, but not until one comes to grips with their condition. I certainly do not know you well enough to judge that. I avoid talking about my own pain as much as possible, I don<APO>t believe in focusing on the negatives, that just makes them worse. If you quit due to a work accident, you may be eligible for worker<APO>s comp, that might help you with medical expenses. You could also call Goodwill, Salvation Army, Catholic Charities, etc. to find free/low cost clinics in your area. I don<APO>t know what the county system is for primary care on your community, here we have county health clinics that do primary care, call your county health department to ask about that. Take care, Annette""How long ago was your last MRI? Have your symptoms changed? Why are you going to yet another doctor? I would call the NP and tell her what is going on, see if she can help you until the next doctor takes over. Take care, Annette""Back when I worked at an ER that contracted with companies to do random drug screens, the employees<APO> supervisors were not a part of the equation at all. One had to tell the person, usually a nurse, doing the drug screens what meds they were on in case they came up, but that was confidential information. I never even met anyone that the person getting the test worked with, and their supervisor never got a copy of my paperwork. They got different papers, saying whether or not someone passed the test. All that meant was if the person involved took meds that were not prescribed to them and they showed up on their urine. They were not even told what the drug was exactly. Having been in your shoes several times, I would not suggest that you tell anyone that you work with. I am with Swank on this one, I would not tell anyone other than a spouse or a best friend. You do what is right for you, just know that you cannot take back information once you have shared it, so think hard ahead of time. I did not have an epidural, so I can<APO>t help you there. Just do your homework first, and find out all about them before you have one. Take care, Annette""I think it may be impossible to determine the cause of all your problems, Some are undoubtedly related to opioid withdrawal from the methadone, as you already noted. Some may be due to withdrawal from the tramadol, and others may be side effects of the Nucynta. You do not mention the doses or timing of your present drugs or the new drugs. I personally feel that any doctor who changes your meds that drastically and expects you to ""see him in 28 days"" is a bit nuts himself. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Talk to your doctor. There are many options as far as pain treatment goes. Also try and keep your blood sugar under very good control as that helps control the pain in your feet and toes. Talk to the doc that manages your diabetes about that. Take care, Annette""Also talk to your doctor about diabetic neuropathy and the best way to treat it. Opiates are not always good for this. Take care, Annette""Opiates just do not work very well for peripheral neuropathy from diabetes. Sorry, in my experience reading the Bible doesn<APO>t work either. Take care, Annette""Why don<APO>t you just discuss this with your doctor? I have had chronic pain for over 15 years now, and rarely get sick with colds/flu, etc. I personally believe that everyones immune system is a bit different. Take care, Annette""I would get a second surgical opinion, and also see a neurologist for his take on things. Take care, Annette""Best of luck with a surgical second opinion. What diagnosis did the neurologists give you and what all did they suggest? How did the neurontin work? Take care, Annette""Many things can cause back pain, take him to the doctor so they can figure out what the problem is. Take care, Annette""Addiction is a medical problem, just like chronic pain is. it is a ""true"" problem. It makes people do things that they would not ordinarily do. It is easier to treat chronic pain than it is addiction, I would rather be me than her. I wouldn<APO>t trust anyone who had stolen from me until she had gone a long time without stealing from me again. If she is working her program and keeping clean, then she should be able to earn your trust back at some point. Practically speaking, I would put aspirin in my medication bottle in my purse around her for awhile, and keep the real thing in a pill box in my pocket. See what happens. if she steals the aspirin, then you know she is not to be trusted. I have had friends who had addiction problems, and I did not invite them to my home until they were clean for several years. If she was a good person prior to her addiction problem surfacing, she is probably a good person if she is clean now. Take care, Annette""The fact that the doctor was cold and indifferent, and non-responsive to your phone calls are all good reasons to change doctors. Later, when you feel better, you might write the doctor a note and explain why you didn<APO>t come back. Next time ask the doctor for a time frame for returning phone calls, setting up referrals, RX refills etc. That gives you more information. Take care, Annette""I would call the PCP back and tell him you have a June 4th appt. with Pain Management and could he write you a RX for whatever pain meds you need until then. Good luck to you. Take care, Annette""Many insurance companies have appeal processes. I had an insurance company that did not have my sleep aid on their formulary. All it took was a letter from my doctor stating we had already tried the drugs on their list and they did not work for me. They approved it without any further problem and provided it until we left them for a different insurance company a couple of years later. Take care, Annette""I took tramadol for many years and went off of it without any symptoms at all. That said I still looked it up in my drug book and it does not list seizures as a symptom of withdrawal at all. Tramadol actually lowers your seizure threshold while you are taking it, your seizure threshold should go back to normal when you go off of the drug. This is a concern when one first prescribes the drug to a patient, I don<APO>t think they would want to give it to someone who had a history of seizure disorder for instance. I think this means that if you were going to have seizures, you would have had them while on the drug. This might be because this drug inhibits the reuptake of serotonin in your system, it is all in the warning box, where it says not to mix them with other drugs that also have this effect, or you might have seizures. The drug handbook states that withdrawal may include anxiety, diarrhea, nausea, pain, piloerection (goose bumps), rigors, sweating, and tremors. Hallucinations are included but the book states they are very rare. The book also says one should never take more than 400 mg. a day of this drug, did your doctor tell you to take 800 mg. a day or was that your idea? Doctors out here are pretty careful with this med, I have never heard of a doctor ordering 800 mg. a day. It sounds to me like you have gotten past the worst part, but I would also suggest you see a doctor, both about the withdrawal and about pain management without it. Take care, Annette""I am sorry, but I don<APO>t know anything about pain and Keppra. Hopefully once you are off the Keppra, you and your doctor can decide if it was the drug that caused your pain, or something else. Hopefully, it will be the drug. It may well take getting off of it completely for a while to find this out. Take care, Annette""Hi, Mike Sorry to hear you are going through this. I went through a similar situation years ago. I called the pharmacy and told the head pharmacist that my RX was short, and that my personal opinion was that he had a ""problem"" employee. I made it clear to him that I did not want the pills replaced, and that the phone call was simply a heads up for him. The second time it happened a couple of months later, I changed my RX to a different store, and called the head dude again, and told him the same thing. We had a long talk, the following week all the personnel at the pharmacy except one person changed. I never told my doctor. They were short-acting opiates and I did without. Fortunately, they were not the long-acting ones, those were okay. My doctor is aware that I keep the short-acting opiates when I do not need them and use them if my pain acts up, but never more than she prescribes to begin with. I do not know about exchanging different long-acting meds like you are suggesting, Opana and Oxycontin. Maybe now is the time to talk to your doctor, I don<APO>t know, it is up to you. In future, you may request the pharmacist to count the pills in front of you when you pick them up. At the least I would count them as soon as you get home, before putting them in your safe. Then pick a day once a week to count them to make sure you are on the right track. I do this Saturday nights, when I fill my pill box. Glad to hear your two little ones are doing fine. My littlest grandson is 6 now, he started kindergarten this year. My older grandson graduates from high school this year and is going into the Marines. He was just 12 when his mom married my son.They grow up so fast. Breathe in and out slowly, things will be fine. Good to see you. Take care, Annette""I am sure it will all work out in the long run, but that doesn<APO>t make it much easier now. Everyone needs to handle this in the way that makes them most comfortable. Especially, regarding their own doctor. Sorry, I didn<APO>t respond sooner, I only get on line 2-3 times a week now. Take care, Annette""I do not carry the pharmacy bag out of Rite Aid, I put the pills in my purse or pocket. I have gotten other meds by mail order and really liked one company, Medco. A different one keeps screwing up the $$ owed and credit, etc. I won<APO>t use them once my RX runs out. The copay was more expensive than the store for schedule II meds, so I didn<APO>t use them for that. I refuse to use UPS anymore or use any company that will only ship UPS. I reported a missing package and they as much as said I was a liar. My husband and I do a lot of shopping on line and got lots of UPS deliveries just dropped over our gate. I was told I would be treated differently for two years, but they then continued it. I get a note first saying the package was not delivered due to no one being at home to sign for it. We, of course, were at home. If I am lucky the following day they deliver the package when I leave a note on the door demanding that they knock, and wait a minute or two, for us to answer the door. I would literally open the door and see the truck pulling away after hurrying to answer the door. I have not used them at all for two years now and do not miss them at all. I am glad it has worked out for you. Take care, Annette""I guess there is a place for the US Postal Service, that is who I generally use. I haven<APO>t had a problem with FedEx, but I have not dealt with them either, lol. We enjoyed dealing with UPS until our package went missing, never again. I believe it is the drivers usually that make the company, they are the ones that deal with the consumers. Take care, Annette""I wouldn<APO>t go by what the ER doctor tells you, I would see what your pcp tells you if you feel comfortable with him. If not find a pcp that you do feel good about. Get a real diagnosis either from the pcp or from an orthopedic specialist and go from there. Lots of different things can cause pain and numbness, they all have different treatments. Once you get a diagnosis, maybe we will be able to help you more. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know how strict your doctor is. Yes, you could get kicked out. Both for filling the RX for tramadol and for giving one to your boyfriend. That is called diversion and is one of the reasons doctors want to limit how many pain killers are floating around out there. Why didn<APO>t your boyfriend get his own? Was it insurance access? Is there some reason the doctor did not offer him his own RX since you were both diagnosed with the same thing? If the PM doctor you are seeing asks to see the RX bottle and counts the pills, he will assume you took one. Think of what you wish to say to him... In the future never share RX meds, it is bad for both of you, in the long run. Take care of yourself, I hope you fell better soon. Annette""Good luck with in patient pain treatment, it probably is not going to happen any time soon. I really suggest finding a good pcp, and sticking with him/her until he/she figures out what is wrong with you. I wouldn<APO>t bother with specialists until you KNOW what kind to go to and why you are seeing him. This has worked well for me, can<APO>t hurt you anyway. If you feel like killing or hurting yourself, please call the appropriate hotlines. Take care, Annette""Yikes, I am nearly 62, I thought you had a problem with the doctor saying she was ""relatively young"" because you thought he meant she was old. It wasn<APO>t until I read your entire post that I understood what you meant, that 55 year old women are not old at all or even relatively young. I wasn<APO>t hurt by what the doctor said. I think that the person who started this thread is physically older than a 55 year old without health issues. I believe that is what he meant. She has probably another 30-35 years to go, and she should try to enjoy them as much as she can. Take care, Annette""Many family doctors have xray equipment in their offices now, as do many urgent care offices. Just another alternative to the ED. Take care, Annette""I have disc problems and never had swelling in my lower extremities. What does your own doctor say is causing the swelling? Can you press fairly gently and leave a dent in the swollen area with your fingertip? Take care, Annette""I would get a referral to a neurologist to evaluate your swelling and pain, twitching, etc. I would not bother with the ER, they will do only what is needed to rule out life threatening problems and tell you to see someone else anyway. Perhaps your pcp will know what you should do, I would not skip seeing a doctor just because the swelling is gone. Your word should be good enough for the doctor. Take care, Annette""You can always take photos of your legs while they are swollen with your cell phone perhaps...show the doctor this photos. I would not assume the swelling and the spinal disc problems are related, they may indeed not be. Take care, Annette""I read the article, thanks for posting a link to it. However, it is far too soon to discuss this with your doctor. The study only had 10 people in it, that is not enough to be statistically significant. If they do further larger studies that show it works, perhaps one would consider it. However, you cannot be taking opiates and take this drug as it will reverse the opiates and put you into withdrawals. It is an opiate antagonist. My current pain meds work, I am not sure I would taper off of them to try a drug that might work. That is a long and difficult process where I would be in severe pain during the tapering process. The drug company that makes it is looking for new uses for it, so they can make more money, they are also pushing its use for treatment of alcoholism. It would be interesting to know who paid for the small FMS study, I will go back and reread the article and see if it says who financed the study. Thanks again, Annette""I have had several surgeries over the years, and had incisional pain and/or numbness also for about a year, sometimes longer. I so agree with you, knowing what to expect is so helpful. Ask all these kinds of questions prior to having surgery to avoid surprises. Take care, Annette""What does your doctor say? What tests have been done so far? Are you a diabetic, do you smoke? Take care, Annette""I have FMS, have had it for over 14 years now. I would suggest you see a rheumatologist who has FMS experience to confirm the diagnosis. I do not believe in someone who says they do not believe in FMS, I would just move on to a different doctor. I have never had a doctor who doubted its existence. If you do not have peripheral neuropathy, and have had all the usual tests done for other illnesses that can cause pain, and your symptoms fit with FMS, see about getting treatment. I am a bit confused because your name does not appear before, who exactly are you? Take care, Annette""Hi, Roxane Do you have diabetes? That can cause peripheral neuropathy also. I had pain on the tops of my feet when I was first diagnosed with FMS. But, then it moved on up my legs and into my hips. I tried changing shoes, etc. No help. I was living in NV when I was diagnosed and moved to Oregon within a few years. My doctor in Reno did all the usual tests to rule out other causes of pain. I had LOTS of blood drawn back then. I saw a rheumatologist at my pcp<APO>s request, he agreed with the diagnosis and my pcp treated me. I hope you find a good doctor where you are living now. I really like my doctor I have been going to her for almost 15 years now. Take care, Annette""I have done the same thing in regards to short flare ups of pain, my doctor was willing to increase my opioids and I said no, I will add other things and wait it out. It leveled out again without increasing my opioids. That is probably why I have been able to maintain low doses for many years. Don<APO>t believe everything you read on line about Florida and pain meds. I have a dear friend in Florida and she and her husband both have chronic pain, and take opiates regularly, both get their opiates from their pcps without any problems. I asked her myself a few weeks ago, that is what she told me. She is in her early 50s, and he is in his early 70s. Take care, Annette""Hi, Dennis I adore CBT, and have used it for years. I also have nerve pain, I use gabapentin and it does seem to help it. Everyone must figure nerve pain out for themselves. It is difficult to treat. Take care, Annette""Hi, Dennis I take gabapentin, but I take the entire 24 hour dose in the evening. I do not break it up into three or four doses. My doctor was giving it to her other pain patients that way and talked me into trying it too. She said they got relief as well as anyone did and did not have to deal with sedation, my main concern. I felt a bit drunk at first, not anymore though. I am not sure I would put up with auditory hallucinations though. I take 800 mg. in one tablet once a day. Works for me. I tried Lyrica and did not get as good a result from it. Take care, Annette""My pharmacy has not been able to fill my RX right then one time. They called my doctor for me, and got permission to use the pharmacy next door. They also called ahead and made sure they had what I needed. I can<APO>t complain at all. Take care, Annette""The gabapentin and the Lyrica are different meds with different doses. It would not be correct to prescribe the same dose of Lyrica as you were getting of gabapentin. For instance, even though aspirin and ibuprofen are both NSAIDs, aspirin is usually suggested for adults as two pills (each one is 325 mg) every four hours as needed for pain, and ibuprofen is usually suggested for adults as one or two pills (each one is 200 mg.) every six hours as needed for pain. Different drugs, different doses, different time schedules. Different everything. I do not know what you mean by ""nerve jumps"". Talk to your doctor, about all of this stuff. Take care, Annette""I hope the pain medicine pump works out well for you and you do not have any problems with the insertion surgery. I do have a compassionate, wonderful doctor, I have been her patient for nearly 13-14 years now. Before that I had other excellent doctors. The fact is the DEA has never affected me or the way my doctors have opted to treat my pain. I have been on daily opioid therapy for more than 15 years. Take care, Annette""I have read erroneous information on this site that stated Florida law forbade regular doctors, non-pain specialists, from writing RXs for opioids. It is not true. I am sorry that you are having so much trouble getting RXs for opiates. Methadone is an opioid, but not an opiate since it is not made directly from opium poppies. Methadone clinics are for the treatment of addiction in my area, they do not have pain specialists at all. Same thing in the other two states I have lived in. At 30 mg. at least you are fairly close to getting off completely so another doctor will see you. I would not move anywhere without finding a satisfactory doctor first because I know how difficult that can be. Kind of like finding a job first back when I was working. I have visited Florida once, and would not opt to move there for other reasons. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""I entered my city, Gresham, OR and my zip code and no matches were found. I am not sure how they choose who to list, but I have seen an excellent pain specialist in my town as a consultant twice. He still has an office here, don<APO>t know why his name does not come up. I also did the search for my pcp under the city where her office is located, who currently writes my RXs, and has for nearly 15 years. She did not come up either. Take care, Annette""The pain management doc has pain management as his stated specialty, and did an appropriate residency and fellowship. I checked him out when my pcp suggested him. My own doctor, pcp, is an internal medicine doctor who also manages chronic pain. These are two great doctors, that I know personally. I have come across some search engines like this before, and sometimes doctors are only posted if a patient or ""someone"" recommends them or if they pay a fee to someone on the site. It is nice to know that we have another resource to use, just everyone please remember to double check everything first. Do your own research. Take care, Annette""Hi, Dennis I am sorry that you have not found the right treatment for your pain yet. Maybe your doctor cut the dose BECAUSE you told him the morphine does nothing for your pain. Opiates do not help with all kinds of pain in every person. He has to be able to show that his patients are improving with any drug he prescribes. Communication can be very difficult between patient and doctor. Take care, Annette""The problem is for you if your doctor dies, retires or moves away. Will you be able to find another doctor willing to prescribe that dosage? 700 mg. a day IS high, but it does not matter what the dose is, he still has to be able to show with notes in your medical records that the opioid is helping you. If it is no longer helping you, the choice is to go off of it completely, or rotate to a different medicine and see how that works for you. Or add a non-opioid and see if that helps. Or try a non-drug treatment and see how that goes. I take methadone now, after taking morphine for about 12 years, I am only taking 20 mg. of methadone a day, and have up to 50 mg. of oxycodone per day that I can use for breakthrough pain. I usually take 15 mg. at a time, sometimes 20 mg. if the pain is really bad. I also use cognitive behavioral therapy, and my hot tub, etc. every day. The pain is not ever gone completely, but it is generally managable. I just do what I am able and put off the rest. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""In MY experience this is not caused by epidurals. But that does not mean it never happens. I have learned not to get into arguments over these things with someone, who knows someone who had it happen to them. Everyone should talk to their own MDs and discuss thoroughly any medical procedure one might be considering. Take care, Annette""I did go and read the abstract and it was about two different drugs interacting with one another and causing a problem. I thought we were talking about epidural injections causing a Cushing<APO>s response on their own. Take care, Annette""Please see the gynecologist regarding your periods, etc. I am no expert in these things, but I would be hesitant to blame all of this on two cortisone injections. Take care, Annette""I started Peri-menopause at 41, stopped having periods for seven years, then they came back with a vengeance, YUCK!!! Other than my own experience, I am no expert. Take care, Annette""The treatment of FMS is different for everyone. Also treating depression can be difficult. Do you have peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes or other reasons? If it is from diabetes, it may be very important to keep your blood sugars tightly regulated so it does not get worse. If you have gastroparesis, the pain meds that you take orally may not be getting absorbed properly. Do you take anything for that diagnosis at this time? I agree that all of these things require treatment, and opiates may or may not be part of a successful treatment plan. I have had great luck with cognitive behavioral therapy. Take care, Annette""Hi, Mike Glad the pharmacist worked things out for you. I hope the percoset works out for your pain. It is so confusing to try and adjust a shortage of long acting meds with short acting ones. There is an equation figuring the switchover to morphine in mgs. per a 24 hour day, then switching back to the oxycodone in percoset per a 24 hour day. I would not even attempt to go there. Very confusing. Let me know how it all works out for you. Take care, Annette""There is no guarantee that it would help with your pain. Spinal disc surgery is only helpful for pain about 50% of the time. It is better for treating actual loss of function. Even at 50% of the time, success is rated as an improvement of 50% or more of your pain. So if half the people who have the surgery get relief, they may still have up to 50% of the pain they had to begin with. I had a cervical discectomy done for functional deficits in 1992. It was successful for that, function in my hands returned. Six months later, I herniated the disc above the one they removed. My neurosurgeon refused to do more surgery as my function remained intact. He would not do spinal surgery for pain as he felt the risks were too high to warrant it. I was a young, healthy, non-smoker at the time. Within about two years, things improved as they often do. My hands still go numb if I sit with my head down for extended periods of time. It is also difficult to impossible to tell how much of your pain is due to the neck problem and how much is due to your FMS. Surgery like that won<APO>t help your FMS pain and may make it worse. I developed FMS some time after my surgery, I would never go through that surgery again for pain management. I had a blood clot after surgery and had to be on blood thinners for six months. The whole thing was very scary. I currently use meds and cognitive therapy with good enough relief for me. Take care, Annette""I would stop seeing ER doctors and let your own pcp be in charge of your workup. If the problem occurred in both legs then I rather doubt, with my basic anatomical knowledge, that an injection in one side caused the problem. It might have made it worse on the side of the injection. I have had sciatica due to IM injections twice in the past. It goes away. I took oral steroids once for it, but do not really think it helped much in hindsight. It is good news that the EMG and the CT came back normal. Steroids like prednisolone need to be used very cautiously. I would only use them for a brief time, one to two weeks, no more often than once or twice a year. The side effects can be really awful if overused. Why are you taking klonopin? The others made sense with what you are complaining of. Take care, Annette""Steroids do not help anything heal, they just mask pain and other symptoms until they either go away of the steroid wears off. I have no experience with lumbar steroid injections, so I really can<APO>t help you there. Since you were seen originally in the ER for back and neck pain, before you got the muscle relaxant injection, I would have the ER send your records to the pain management doctor. They have hundreds of patients so don<APO>t concern yourself with him not remembering who you are over the phone. I am not sure how an injection in your hip would cause back spasms either, or a feeling like your leg was tearing off, but my anatomy is really old, and I may well have forgotten some of it. Take care, Annette""It doesn<APO>t really matter what was in the injection, usually sciatic pain from an injection is from the needle itself. I have had this twice and that is how my doctors explained it to me. The prednisolone might help, are you taking it orally? It could still take a couple of months to heal completely. Did the doctors say the injection caused the pain you are having down both legs, the right more than the left? In your initial post you said that it was what you thought the pain/numbness was from. I have personally never heard of an IM injection causing sciatic pain in both legs, I don<APO>t understand physically how that could happen. Doesn<APO>t mean it hasn<APO>t happened, just that I have never run into it. Take care, Annette""I would personally avoid the ER for chronic pain issues, and stick with my pcp. I would personally avoid mixing klonopin with any opioid. That is my thing, just make sure your doctors are all aware of this prescription. Take care, Annette""This may sound simplistic, but just don<APO>t sit on them. If you have other symptoms, discuss them with your pcp or an orthopedic doctor. Take care, Annette""Sorry, Charles, I disagree on this one. A doctor has to write the RX, so she can<APO>t just take more. Also if her present doctor dies or retires or moves away, and she has to find a new doctor, how difficult might it be if she is on a very high dose of opiates? She also has previous addiction problems, once one has had that problem, it seldom is resolved forever. Anyhow, if I were her I would try everything but opiates first. I found cognitive behavioral therapy to be very useful. Take care, Annette""I do not consider taking a prescribed pain pill for physical pain as breaking your sober time. I would still consider you clean and sober. Whatever helps you is fine, since your belief in a higher power is strong, hang on to it, and you will be fine. I personally believe in CBT, it has worked for me in some really hard times. Take care, Annette""My mental health therapist suggested a book to me called ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns, MD. It is available in paperback and has gone through multiple editions, you may even find it in a thrift store. I got it for less than $20 at one of the big box book stores. It includes worksheets and so on that you can use to track your progress. I only picked out some of the techniques and it cured my depression. No drugs at all, though it is fine to use them with CBT. They use CBT for many things nowadays. Another book I found to be very helpful is ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"" by Dr. Margaret A. Caudill, MD, PhD. Also was about $20. Not sure what it costs now. Both use CBT techniques, the first for depression and anxiety, the second for pain management. Take care, Annette""I would get a second opinion, perhaps with a pain management specialist, there are many options short of surgery if over-the-counter meds do not work. Take care, Annette""What does your doctor say? Have to discussed it with him after the urgent care visit? I assume the PTSD was treated, have you fully recovered? Take care, Annette""I would just see the new doctor and ask your questions and present your symptoms to him. I am glad your PTSD is somewhat better, but I would continue with treatment as that can affect pain perception. My son has PTSD from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, it does get better. I used cognitive behavioral therapy and found it very helpful, have you tried that for the anxiety and panic attacks? Please do not lose hope on this site. There are a lot of good folks here. I only post 2-3 times a week, and weekends are usually slow. Be patient and watch for replies, and read other posts that may be related to your experiences. Take care, Annette""If the only answer is to go to the ER, try pacing or standing at least. I would ask the doctor to write a RX for an oral pain med, it is usually faster, cheaper, and easier than going to the ER for a shot of a pain killer. Sitting makes me hurt all over, so anytime I have to wait, I usually do it standing up. I can read while standing, that helps pass the time. The ER cannot give a time frame over the phone, because anything can happen from moment to moment to change the wait time. People would be furious if they were told they would get in to see a doctor in an hour and it took three... Take care, Annette""Well said, I agree with it all. Take care, Annette""I had breast reduction surgery about 18 months ago, for pain reduction reasons. I am 61 years old, I wish I had done it years ago. My back, chest, shoulder pain is gone completely. I agree with you that surgery should always be the last option as it is the most invasive. Please remember that your opinion is not the point of this discussion. She has to decide, and there is no guarantee that this is the best choice. She should see several plastic surgeons for consults and then really think about it. In the end she must decide. If her accident happened ""a few years ago"", any healing should have been complete by now. Her expectations are very important in how she does with this kind of surgery. All I wanted was a reduction in pain, and I ended up with so much more. I have chronic pain in other areas of my body, but now I have pretty breasts too. You don<APO>t mention her age by the way, or if she has kids or wants to breastfeed babies in the future. There are many things to consider, although surgical techniques have improved over the years. Take care, Annette""Are you meaning to say Dilaudid? I can<APO>t find dilodin in my drug handbook. Oxycodone is the usual drug that they follow vicodin with when it stops working well. Dilaudid is less used, and I would discuss this with her pcp or whatever doctor prescribes her medicines for her. I hope no one here is going to suggest specific medicines for you to try, that would be a bad idea. Even over the counter meds have side effects, especially in older adults. Call her own doctor. Take care, Annette""I agree with Swank, it is time to see your own pcp, get one if you do not have one. Take care, Annette""My sympathy for the loss of your brother. I do not know specifically from research or anything, but I have read posts from patients that they no longer absorb many different medications in the same way they did prior to their bariatric surgery. If you take any RX meds, I would discuss this thoroughly with the prescribing doctors and the bariatric specialists. Write down your questions and their answers, discuss with family and friends. Take care, Annette""Excuse me, but isn<APO>t Suboxone addictive? Does it not at least cause dependence? It is a mix of buprenorphine and naloxone, an opioid analgesic and an opioid antagonist. I have not used this drug myself, so I am not that familiar with it. Using it for opioid addiction is far different than using it for pain management. I use methadone for pain management, and used to hand it out as a nurse in a methadone clinic for heroin addicts. Dosing and timing of doses is completely different. Suboxone is used for addiction treatment also, as you know, but buprenorphine is also used for pain management. I would discuss this with a pain management specialist, an addiction specialist, and your surgeon long before your bunion surgery. It is somewhat more complicated than one would think. Take care, Annette""Don<APO>t forget, there is Suboxone, and Subutex, they are slightly but importantly different. Take care, Annette""Bless you for caring so much about your mother. I hope her friend was her doctor??? One should never take any kind of supplement without discussing it with their doctor first. Please have her discuss this with her doctor now. Take care, Annette""The ER may give you a CT scan, pain meds, and a referral doctor, or they may not. The referral doctor is just a doctor on a list who is willing to take patients as referrals. There is no guarantee that he will accept your insurance or agree with how you wish to be treated, just that he will see you one time. If you can read the phone book and/or your insurance booklet, you have a batter chance of finding a doctor on your own. If you can afford it, I would suggest paying someone to do any heavy housecleaning/laundry that you need doing. Even a few hours twice a month is well worth it. I hope you find a doctor that is simpatico soon. Take care, Annette""I have not read these articles myself so I am not sure what they say. I have scanned through them but not read them properly. That said I do subscribe to a professional nursing journal, and it has verified the basic percent of patients who use opiates and become addicted to them as less than 1%. The was based on a group of articles done by doctors who did evidence based studies of good quality. If addiction is a concern and I believe it always should be on our radar, it certainly relieved me to read this. This was a couple of years ago and we did discuss it here. This was only regarding addiction, not diversion issues, overdosing, etc. Thanks for posting your own documentation regarding this topic. Take care, Annette""Hi, Bren-Bren Good to see you posting here more. I am sorry, but the journal article was about 2 years ago. It supported what Charles was posting at the time. I don<APO>t even bother reading most general media articles about pain meds, as they are politically in line with the newspaper that publishes them, and they never say where they got their data. I took a class on evaluating medical studies some years ago in relation to a state committee I was on at the time studying pain meds for non-malignant chronic pain. It seems like the important points were the number of people in the study, whether or not it was truly double blind, how long it lasted, and who paid for the study. Charles supplies us with great articles and links to go read them. I certainly can<APO>t say mine are current. Take care, Annette""I hand carry my RXs for opioids because they are schedule II and it is required. I don<APO>t run out, why do you? My doctor gives me three monthly RXs at a time, as is allowed by law. She dates each one as to when it can be filled. I actually see her once every three months. I go to the pharmacy once a month for my opioids. I drop the RX off and do my grocery shopping next door, it is always ready when I come back. The pharmacy in the grocery store was too slow, so I don<APO>t go there anymore. It was more like what you described. My doctor writes for oxycodone without acetaminophen in it, so I don<APO>t have to worry about that. I use a lot of mind games to divert myself from the pain so I can keep my opioid doses as low as possible for as long as possible. I am 61 and started daily opioid use at about 38. I would keep avoiding spinal surgery, I had one done on my neck for functional reasons. I threw a clot afterwards, once was enough. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""It is interesting that you are complaining of pelvic pain and that your MIL had ovarian cancer, and that the pelvic pain seemed to get worse on the way to her funeral. That does not mean you cannot have a physical cause for your pain, but the doctors seem to have done all the tests that should show anything at all in that area. Except for the small ovarian cyst all seems to be negative. I would do a bit of watchful waiting. Keep a journal of your feelings, both emotional and physical, also score your pain once a day, and mark in when you have your menstrual cycles. In several months , check it and see if you see any patterns. Bring these to your doctor<APO>s attention. Take care of yourself, keep in touch. Annette""Please see an orthopedic specialist as soon as you are able. If you put it off until it is really bad, he may not be able to fix it with you. Take care, Annette""What is your question? Take care, Annette""In some states if ANY opiates are found in a blood test you are considered impaired. It is very black and white. I chose where to live partially on this legal thing because I knew at some point I would probably be on 24 hour a day opioids. In my state there is a grey area where a peace officer must state his opinion of whether or not you are impaired, and hopefully back it up with direct observations of your behavior or statements. So you could take opioids and test positive and still drive legally. An article in our daily newspaper said which states were like ours, I think there were only six or seven at that time, about 10 years ago. Take care, Annette""Find a doctor you trust and tell him about all your aches and pains. They may be related. Take care, Annette""I do have FMS, and I do manage to get out of bed every day, and I do exercise for an hour daily for the last 3 years. It is a choice for me. ""Wanting to exercise"" and actually doing it are very different. Doing it does make me feel better globally, although it does not decrease my pain at all. The only days I have ever skipped are some of the days I am on vacation at Christmas with my son and his family for ten days. I do plan my active days and restful days, but I don<APO>t eat right at all. In spite of not eating right, the increased activity has helped me lose over 50 pounds, very slowly though, which is fine. FMS is not a death sentence at all. I can<APO>t work anymore, but I can volunteer for an hour a week at the animal shelter without any problems at all. I have been blessed with my doctors, I have never had a doctor be strange about FMS. They have all treated it like just another chronic disease. Take care, Annette""Please see an orthopedic specialist. And DON<APO>T do any high impact exercises until after he okays it. Take care, Annette""Ditto what she said. Please see a doctor at a teaching hospital as soon as you can. I am also an RN with a neuro condition that I had never heard of when I was diagnosed in 1995. I had been an RN for 25 years when I was diagnosed. Take care, Annette""What kind of doctor are you seeing for this problem, your pcp, an orthopedic specialist, etc.? I would suggest a specialist like an ortho, a rheumatologist, or a neurologist or all three. Take care, Annette""Occupational therapists are too often overlooked. They are wonderful resources. Take care, Annette""Discuss this with the prescribing doctor. Your weight can have something to do with it. Or you just might not remember things the same because you were excited about the pain relief...who knows. Were/are you taking a breakthrough pain med? Are you on any other meds that you might not have been on before? There are many kinds of meds that interact with opioids and might effect how you feel. There is not a in-between dose for fentanyl patches that I am aware of, maybe you should stick with the 50 mcg and add a breakthrough med, or, wait until your body gets used to the 75 mcg patch and not take a breakthrough med, both are medically acceptable answers. I hope you feel better soon. Take care, Annette""That is a good option, I did not even think of it. I would try and stick with the same manufacturer if possible. Take care, Annette""Please make sure she sees an addiction specialist connected with a pain management practice, not just her family doctor. They do not know as much as they should about addiction. Best of luck to all of you. Take care, Annette""Best of luck to you. She is lucky to have you in her life. Take care, Annette""Roxys and oxys contain oxycodone and Norcos contain acetaminophen and hydrocodone. All three are short acting opiates prescribed for pain. Short acting means they act for four to six hours, long acting opioids last much longer, usually eight to 24 hours. Please talk to your daughter and find out what she is taking and why. Then you might talk to your own doctor or her doctor. She may have a pain condition, or she may have an addiction problem. There is a huge difference between being addicted to pain meds and using them properly for pain. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I meant to say that oxycodone and hydrocodone are both short acting opiate pain pills. Acetaminophen is the generic for tylenol, an over the counter analgesic. So sorry. Take care, Annette""Please read my addition above. Take care, Annette""Please see your own doctor about this, be sure to tell him that the pain seemed to start in your middle finger, and that history as well. Take care, Annette""Have you discussed this with your own surgeon? What did he tell you? I hope the neurontin helps, I have taken it for many years with excellent results. Take care, Annette""I have had several surgeries, and had some nerve damage from each with accompanying numbness. I have always given my body at least a year to recover from any surgery. It is great that it only takes 2-3 months with newer techniques. Take care, Annette""I would do what her surgeon says. Anytime they insert a needle of any kind in the spinal canal, fluid can leak out, having a headache due to that is a fairly common adverse effect. If the headache is really bad in spite of doing the things he suggested, I would call him back, preferably during office hours, and tell him how bad it is. I would not play phone tag with him for more than a couple of hours. One would hope it has been dealt with by now though. Take care, Annette""Do whatever your surgeon tells you to do as far as meds and activity levels. You might also see a pain management specialist. Surgeons are not trained to do more than treat immediate post op pain, after that they don<APO>t know what to do. My husband had AVN of the head of his femur and they did a total replacement, he was back to work as a big truck mechanic in 8-10 weeks. No restrictions. He was in his mid 60s at that time. All that shows is we are all different. His pcp has always written opioid RXs as he needed them. He has written for all the pain pills through out my husband<APO>s hip problems, surgery etc. His surgeon never did, at our request. Please do not expect from the surgeon what he is incapable of doing. Take care, Annette""Did you continue to fill RXs for these meds, or did you tell her what happened and that you no longer needed them? I would suggest you keep looking until you do find another doctor, and work on the trust issues until they will write RXs for you. You are not getting any meds now, maybe that will shorten the time you are off of them. Take care, Annette""At one breath per minute I would hope he would call the paramedics too. Take care, Annette""WebMD does not respond, and says so at times. I have often just went on ahead and it did post some of my posts later on, or it goes back and forth between accepting and not accepting posts. I love my hot tub when my pain gets out of control. CBT is also helpful. Take care, Annette""Diabetic neuropathy can cause many kinds of strange sensations on your feet, not necessarily pain. Do your best to keep your sugars at a normal level, but the neuropathy may have happened before you were diagnosed. Keep mentioning it to your doctors, my mom always told me the squeaky wheel gets the grease. If you stop complaining the doctors forget you ever had a problem. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t think it is withdrawal from opiates. But it may be that when the opiates wear off the sensation returns full force. I have had RLS for many years and this sounds very similar to that. All I can say is to just keep complaining to your doctor as long as the symptoms continue, and do your own research on the subject to share with your doctor. Take care, Annette""If you are talking about marijuana, that is different than heroin. Regardless, I would ask the doctor to prescribe something to help you deal with this legally. You may need a different doctor or you may need to be more forceful yourself with the doctor. Take care, Annette""I would discuss this with your doctor. It may be a form of neuropathy, and it may be that he has a treatment for it. It may be unrelated and need a diagnosis and a completely different treatment. Please do not suffer any more than one needs to. Take care, Annette""I had cervical disc surgery also, and my surgeon cut me off of the vicodin after the first refill, it was only two months after the surgery, he said I didn<APO>t need it anymore. Surgeons are not trained to do any kind of pain management after the acute postop period is over. See your pcp or a pain management specialist for this. Make an appt. right away, not after you run out of meds. If you opt to see a pain management specialist, discuss all his treatment options before you make an appt. so you know you are on the same page. I also recommend that you ALWAYS take pain meds according to the RX instructions, not what gives you relief, or what he may have told you to do. Ask him to please put it in writing, so you get it straight, and remember it correctly. Take care, Annette""There is a difference between dependence and addiction, few people become addicted to their pain meds, most become dependent. Withdrawal is different for everyone. Take care, Annette""You need to ask yourself, do not wait for him to bring it up, it may not happen. I would also speak to your pcp about it. Mine prescribes my pain meds herself and has for many years. If not, at least you might get names of people in your area who practice in pain management. Take care, Annette""It is possible that your body has developed tolerance to the meds, but the pain may also be worse for some reason. You may not have developed tolerance at all. Please always take exactly what the RX says, if it doesn<APO>t work well, go see the prescribing doctor. That is what he is there for. You must ask to see a pain management specialist yourself, ask your pcp about it also. He may be willing to manage your pain for you. My pcp does and has for many years. Take care, Annette""I am glad you at least have some idea where the problem is. Let us know what the CT shows, and what your doctor does about it. Take care, Annette""Did your doctor do any xrays or other imaging studies to check out your hip? What does your MD say? Take care, Annette""I was going to say that you need a RX from a doctor to see a PT, but then I remembered that a gym I went to in Reno had PTs on staff and you only needed a referral or RX from your doctor if you expected your insurance to pay for it. I assumed you were seeing a doctor, but please do see one if you are not. Take care, Annette""I am not sure what your PT means by dislocating your hip by stepping down on the foot incorrectly. I am a retired ER nurse and have taken care of many folks with dislocated hips, they can not even walk until after the doctor replaces the femoral head in the socket. If you have had problems for 2.5 months then I think expecting relief from PT in one month might be pushing things a bit. I do agree with her saying that 12 weeks of therapy might be necessary. Did your doctor give you any kind of time line for recovery? If you are not going along the road to recovery on a reasonable time line, maybe you should go back and see the MD again??? My husband<APO>s doctor did not do an xray of his hip the first time he complained of pain, he examined him by manipulating his joints, and seeing what his response was. The second time he did do an xray. I don<APO>t think your doctor was being unreasonable in his approach. Take care, Annette""Please go see your doctor again and get a follow up evaluation. My husband had avascular necrosis which was diagnosed by xray on a follow up visit. Take care, Annette""Is there any reason why you cannot increase the opiates? It is absolutely normal to become tolerant of opiates and require an increase in dosage periodically. It is not a sign of addiction. How long have you been on daily opiate therapy? Do you have any problems with them or with respiratory depression? Take care, Annette""Best of luck to you. I hope you find a doctor that fits well with your philosophy. It is not really hard to find one, just time consuming. Take care, Annette""Taking all that Ibuprofen for your back pain may be causing rebound headaches, they are also known as chronic daily headaches. A doctor can figure out the timing of your headaches and your ibuprofen dosing, to see if you have rebound headaches, but you need to keep a journal for awhile to show him. You should do that anyway, to determine triggers, etc. for both your back pain and headaches. There is really no way to determine WHY you have back pain, if it is from your pregnancy or from the cheer leading injury. It doesn<APO>t really matter why, but more is there anything you can do for it. Please follow the directions on the ibuprofen bottle for over the counter use, do not over use this med, it can be dangerous. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I don<APO>t think there is any place like that. If there were a geographical fix for any kind of pain, everyone with it would try to move there. The Florida Keys do sound nice this time of year in the Pacific Northwest... Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know about illegal drug sales and such, but here in Oregon we do have doctor assisted suicide and very liberal laws for pain management. I appreciate both, however, I must say that chronic pain is not covered under our or any other assisted suicide laws that I am aware of. I do keep up on these things. One must be considered terminal within six months to take advantage of our assisted suicide law. I bet your thing about the Florida Keys was meant to get retirees to move there and spend their money. Just my opinion. I would visit several times a years during the different seasons before committing to moving. Many types of chronic pain do worsen with changes in barometric pressure, but I think it is usually higher barometric pressure rather than lows. Perhaps phantom pain works differently. The NW has not made my chronic pain any worse at all than it was in Reno, NV. Take care, Annette""I believe in freedom of choice, but about everything, not just abortion. I think it should be up to all people to make all decisions about their healthcare and other kinds of things also. Insurance companies are the worst, they make no products, and do nothing other than making money off the sick and needy. In my humble opinion, of course. Take care, Annette""No worries about spelling. I agree that the rich really control our country, especially politically. I used to self identify as a Christian, don<APO>t anymore. They have too many rules written rather arbitrarily by men. The choosing of which books to include in the Christian Bible was a political move by Constantine. I believe all things pertaining to one<APO>s health should be between God (if you believe in one) and the person and his/her doctor, nobody else. Take care, Annette""Legal suicide in Oregon is called physician assisted suicide, maybe if you do a search on it on Google??? The one in Washington is very similar to Oregon<APO>s. It is kind of like abortion was in the olden days, you have to get two letters from doctors, etc., etc. Then a doctor can give you a RX for the drugs, but you must be able to take them on your own, under your own steam so to speak. My spouse suggests that ALL (now) elected offices be turned into draft jobs, and you drafted, but only get one in a lifetime for a limited term. He says that would eliminate professional politicians. It would also eliminate democracy as we know it, oh well... I did a paper on comparative religion in High School Spanish class when I was a senior. I also was forced to take the Episcopalian classes for confirmation with older students with my older brother. We had a great priest who was very open about everything religious. Take care, Annette""Bren-Bren said it all. Please be aware that in many states it is illegal to obtain any pain meds without telling all doctors who are prescribing pain meds, so her innocent trips to the ER may include felonies. I don<APO>t know what all she is telling her doctors. I would avoid even driving her to the ER, personally. It is very difficult to deal with both chronic pain and addiction, my sympathies go out to all of you. Do you go to her medical appts. with her, and go into the doctors<APO> exam room so you know exactly what she is telling them? I agree she should be seeing an MD level addiction specialist along with her pain management specialist.The best thing to to find them in the same practice. Take care, Annette""Hi, Bren-Bren You know I don<APO>t think anyone should adjust their dose of anything without talking to their doctor first. That said, my doctor started me on 300 mg. a day for one week, then increased it by 300 mg. for one week, etc. I went up to 1800 mg. per day over six weeks, then backed off to 800 mg. per day taken in a single dose in the evening. I felt very lethargic all day on the 1800 mg. dose. All of this was done with my doctor<APO>s guidance. Talk to your doctor as soon as you can. Take care, Annette""I am glad that you have found a medicine that works for your pain, and that you feel good about. I use my hot tub every day, it gives me total pain relief for the time that I am sitting in it, and some muscle relaxation for a while afterwards, so the fentanyl patches are not a good choice for me. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I must have missed this post. I assume you are talking about gabapentin? It is not a drug that I ever remember thinking helped me much, until I went off of it. Then I saw the difference. I do not have any personal experience with labral tears in the hip. My husband had AVN of the femoral head and had a hip replacement done about four years ago. I use Medscape for research on medical topics, perhaps it might be a good choice for you. Take care, Annette""I checked my ""Drug Information Handbook for Advanced Practice Nursing"", dated 2010-2011, and could not find anything that said it must be applied above the breast line. In fact it states it can be used on the chest, back, flanks, and upper arms. The flanks are definitely below the breast line. Can you give me your resource please. Thanks. Take care, Annette""All I did was ask you what your resources were, because I looked it up in the one I had handy and it included using the flanks. We do ask for resources here when/if someone has them. Charles is a great resource for links for various medical studies and articles. I have posted that I have not personally used this drug and why. Take care, Annette""Best of luck to you!! I had an increase in hip/leg pain and finally spoke to my doctor about it. She said I could increase my methadone to 10 mg. three times a day. I was taking 10 mg. at bedtime and 5 mg, twice more a day, so her thought was to increase it by 10 mg. per 24 hours. I declined and increased it 5 mg. once more per day. She gave me permission to use 10 mg. three times a day if I needed to. She is great, she is always looking out for my pain, and wants it to be as low as possible. I have found that methadone works somewhat better for nerve related pain that the other opioids. I found I was using far less BT meds almost immediately. It is the nurse in me, but I do keep very good written records of all the pain meds I take. That and the gabapentin generally does me fine, lol. Take care, Annette""I truly believe in the ""start low, and increase slowly"" plan of attack with this med. I don<APO>t believe it is something to increase on your own, ""if it kind of works, just take more"" is NOT a good plan with this drug. This is how deaths happen with this drug. I am so glad that someone else speaks out on this drug also. Take care, Annette""I really like the methadone. I had extensive experience with using it for patients with addiction problems many years ago, but not for pain management. It takes care of my pain at a low dose, and is really cheap. I asked my doctor for it, as a long acting, scheduled opiate. I do not take it ""as needed"", it is not that kind of drug. I started with half of the dose my doctor originally prescribed and worked my way very slowly up to what worked well for me. Like I said, I keep very careful records of all my opioid use, and the frequency of my BT meds decreased immediately on increasing my methadone dose, even at only 5 mg. per 24 hours. I have to repeat though, do NOT change the dose or frequency on your own. TALK to your doctors FIRST. Take care, Annette""Ask your prescribing doctor, I am unfamiliar with Depo injections and do not know how painful they are. Your boyfriend should not be asking anything of you sexually that does not ""feel good"" to BOTH of you. Take care, Annette""Please discuss this with your doctor, it might be something many people get and you will worry less if you know that. It doesn<APO>t matter if it is during love making or the cuddles, he should not be ""attracted"" to anything that causes you unwelcome pain. I am glad to hear that the episodes of pain have dwindled down. Take care, Annette""Doctors and many nurses have had to take continuing education classes to renew their licenses for many, many years. I was first licensed in Calif. as an RN in 1970 and it was mandatory then for nurses. As far as I remember doctors did the same back then also. The RN licensing boards have said that some of those hours must be in pain management, or domestic abuse, or blood borne illnesses, etc. depending on what state you get licensed in. I don<APO>t think it is any big deal, certainly not for nurses, and I doubt for doctors. In nursing they have never in 40 years increased the total number of continuing education hours needed, just specified what type to take. They are all available on-line for Calif. nurses where I continue to be licensed. They have gotten much cheaper over the years. I want my doctors to keep up on the latest in pain management, so I don<APO>t have a problem with the classes required. I will go and read the article provided in your link myself. Thanks for posting it. Take care, Annette""I read the article and the bibliography. I live in Oregon and am watching the status of people in Washington with their new laws. When I moved to Oregon in the late 1990s, the state medical association had guidelines for doctors prescribing opiates to non-cancer pain patients. They said that the pcp or whatever kind of doctor was prescribing the opioids needed to get informed consent, a consult with a specialist in the area that was appropriate for the patient, document everything including the functionality of the patient, and response to the drugs, etc. Pretty much what most states are doing now. Those were just guidelines from the state medical association, but they pretty much saved the doctors from any kind of problem with authorities investigating them. My doctors all conformed to these guidelines. But they were not ""laws"". All my opioids have been prescribed by either pcps or one rheumatologist. I have had several consults with pain management doctors over the years. I understand the stated problem with Washington<APO>s law stating that 120 mg. a day of morphine or its equivalent required a consult with a pain management specialist. I can see that some people might think that lower doses are perfectly safe, wrong assumption. However, I don<APO>t think doctors would make that mistake. I have been on daily opioids for about 15 years now, and have not yet reached that high a dose, I think... I will have to go to the site that gives equivalent doses and see. I only take 25 mg. of methadone a day, and several doses of oxycodone 15 mg. for BT pain per day. I think if you have a chronic pain condition, you should get a consult with a pain management doctor, it makes good sense to me. Availability of specialists may be a problem in some areas. I did it when I was first diagnosed with chronic pain problems in Reno, and again in Oregon I have seen a couple of them since I moved here, both out in the boonies, and here in the Portland area. Thanks again for the link, it was an interesting read. Take care, Annette""You do have to deal with chronic pain, but that does not mean you are in for a long, miserable life. It is not common to have that particular group of maladies at so young an age, but keep looking and you will find a good doctor. I have had several over the years, all long term doctors. I moved away and had to find a new one. I developed my chronic pain problems in my latter 40s and I am 61 now. If you have ever worked outside the home, I would check out Social Security and Medicare. If you don<APO>t apply for disability in a certain time frame, you lose eligibility for SSDI. I don<APO>t know how this applies to you, or even if it does, just a suggestion. Take care, Annette""Are these indeed ""laws"" that are being passed? Are they rules in a medical practice? Rules can be bent, laws cannot. Where are these laws being passed, so I can be sure not to move there, and can also check it out. I have a friend in Florida who still gets her opiate pain meds from her family doctor for chronic pain, so does her husband, and someone posted it was against the law there for primary care doctors to prescribe any opiates for chronic pain. That may be what they were told by a doctor who didn<APO>t want to prescribe them, but it is not true. Just wondering... Take care, Annette""My state, Oregon does not do this. I will go Google this right now. Take care, Annette""I Googled and ended up at Medscape, and got state by state rules for prescribing drugs. I read all of the ones as far as Kansas, in alphabetical order and did not find this ""law"" about non-pain management doctors writing for schedule II narcotic or opioid medications. As far as being managed by the DEA, their rules are pretty much standard practice everywhere I have worked, as far as documentation goes. The DEA is a federal organization, and it laws regarding drugs take precedence in most cases, but they specifically say that states can write more stringent laws concerning the prescribing of scheduled drugs. By the way each state also has its own list of drugs. Oregon, my state includes pseudophedrine as a prescription only drug. Many states, but not all include carisoprodol (Soma) as a scheduled drug. It is already 2012 by the way, so I don<APO>t really understand your last paragraph. If you have more up to date info (with links if possible) I would like to read them. Take care, Annette""It has been my experience that doctors may state it is ""illegal"" when actually it is the rules of their own practice group not to dispense narcotics. They just do not want to argue. The DEA does not care as long as you have a DEA number. Take care, Annette""There is a nerve that runs down the sides of the back of your head that can be irritated and cause headaches. I think it is the occipital nerve, if I remember correctly. Doctors can inject it with a long acting local anesthetic and a steroid to help calm it down. I saw a regular doctor do this, but I would probably feel more comfortable discussing this possibility and having a neurologist do it. It was diagnosed as occipital neuralgia, you might discuss this possibility with a neurologist that you trust. Take care, Annette""I went to the site you mentioned, there were no research abstracts that I could find, only testimonials from satisfied customers and the guy who is trying to sell it. I want to see randomized, double blind studies that show something might help. Herbals are big business now, the companies make millions, they can do studies if they want to. Thanks anyway. Take care, Annette""You may need opioid therapy, but not Demerol or morphine shots. There are plenty of oral medications available for pain, try those. Maybe see a pain management specialist??? Ask your doctor for either a better answer to your questions, or a referral to another doctor who can give them to you. Some insurance companies do not even require a doctor to make a referral, you can get one on your own. Have you had an MRI of your abdomen? That is far less invasive than surgery and should be the next step in making a diagnosis. In the original reply to your post, the person described a laparoscopic procedure rather than a laparotomy which is an open procedure (more invasive). Take care, Annette""Pancreatitis can be very painful. Try changing pain meds or using a non-drug pain management technique if you have had addiction problems in the past. Morphine is not the only choice. Take care, Annette""I do not think it is a good idea to start morphine from an old prescription without first talking to your doctor. The methadone simply substituted for the morphine while you were on it. Were you tapered off the methadone? How long ago was that? Take care, Annette""Did this doctor tell you to take the belladonna with the morphine you are now taking, or instead of it? Did this doctor know you were taking the morphine? If it was prescribed (not expired) in March 2012, it was meant to be taken in that month, I think. Most schedule II opiates are written one month at a time. Just asking because I don<APO>t quite follow. Take care, Annette""I am so glad the belladonna is working for you. It is a really old drug when used by itself, I am glad your doctor knew about it. Is it mixed with other drugs, or by itself? I gave it once in 40 years by itself to a patient of mine. I think it is part of the mixture of drugs in Donnatal, which is fairly commonly used for spasms in the GI tract. I don<APO>t remember for sure. I am so glad your pain is gone. How wonderful. Take care, Annette""It is good that the circulation is back to your foot, my husband had a vein removed from one leg, and my son also had the same surgery, but veins and arteries are different. Ask your pcp about it, then see what he says, and what kind of doctor to go see. Some surgeons just look at their own results and as long as they are fine, they stop looking. Not a good thing for you. How long has it been since your surgery? Once you find the Donnatol and do not have to worry about that issue anymore, it will be easier to deal with your foot. Are you still smoking? Take care, Annette""I understood that you have a vascular surgeon, he might be correct. Did he say when to expect this pain to diminish? I would also ask your pcp about it, let him know you are having severe pain, maybe he can suggest something... All I can say about the smoking thing, is try and smoke less if and when you can. I remember telling a patient once that smoking one a day was probably okay as far as her health was concerned, a few years later, I read a medical study that said even one a day is unhealthy. I felt terrible for giving her misinformation, but it was the best info we had at the time. It is a very hard addiction to quit, probably the hardest one of all. Do what you can. Take care, Annette""You do what you need to do, and the doctors do what they can do. Please keep in touch. Take care, Annette""Good luck with your surgery on the 7th. I hope it helps with your pain. Please try as hard as you can to stop smoking, at least until you have healed completely. I took care of a patient who had arterial bypass surgery in her legs and the skin incisions never healed closed because she could not quit smoking. I saw her in the ER several years post op and she still had open wounds over the surgical sites. I am glad you got some support here and got information that you needed. Take care, Annette""I am so glad to be of help to you. I will keep my fingers crossed for your surgery, hoping that it cures your chronic pain. I know that you had it today, and promise things will feel better as you go along. The day of surgery and the one or two following it are usually the worst. Take care, Annette""If you cannot afford it, tell your doctor. You may have to try a different drug. I am always honest with my doctor about cost and finances. Plan D is tough, I am really scared of the donut hole. Take care, Annette""There are two kinds of urine tests for drugs, one is a screening test that is fairly cheap and done in the office with a dipstick. It shows only the presence of a drug. The second kind is a qualitative test that shows how much of the drug has been taken. It is much more expensive ($3-400)and usually needs to be sent out to a lab to be done. This second kind would show it if you sere taking less than the doctor prescribed, or less than what you claimed. I have only had a few urine tests, and none have been a problem. They always ask when my last dose of various drugs were taken and how much. I have found being honest with my doctor has worked over the years. Tell your doctor how well the meds work, and when your pain crops up again, what you cannot do when you have a lot of pain, etc. You won<APO>t lose his trust if you are honest, only if he catches you in a lie. Take care, Annette""My doctor did this kind of urine test, and when I complained that Medicare would not cover it and I could not really afford it, she talked to the lab and took care of it. I never had to pay and never got another bill. Talk to your doctor. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know that it tells the doctor that much or not, ask your doctor to explain it to you. He should be willing to do that. Many insurance companies including Medicare will not cover tests to make sure you are not diverting drugs, they only cover medically needed tests. Take care, Annette""I only read part of the article, but he got the definitions of tolerance, dependence, and addiction right so I bet the rest of the article was right on also. Take care, Annette""Please remember that with a base of 1-2% of folks using opiates becoming addicted, even a 300% increase is not very much. That would come out to 3-6% of those folks that used opiates becoming addicted. It would be interesting to know how many subjects were in that study and how it was done. Same with the study that showed 100% of women who were addicts reported physical or emotional abuse, that is not even statistically worth reading if the study only includes 15 women, but would be a lot more impressive to me if it were hundreds of women. Thanks for the link, Bren-Bren. Take care, Annette""The nursing journal ""Nursing 2010"" gave me a number of less than 1% of people getting opiates from doctors become addicted to them. I have also read the 2-3% numbers in other settings. I have found that the numbers given periodically go down further and further. They were reported in the same journal at 5% just a few years ago. Even using 5%, that is a small number of users. Take care, Annette""Addiction is much sneakier than that unfortunately. A person may take their prescribed drug at the prescribed dosage and may notice that it is easier to get through the day at a job they hate, or they just might ""feel better"" emotionally. Soon they are taking the drug for different reasons than the doctor originally intended, not for the physical pain it was originally prescribed for. Some addicts do not ever become the thieving, nasty people you mention. Some do, as they run from withdrawal symptoms. Some simply run from one RX to another, perhaps from one doctor to another. We must all be very careful to ask ourselves why we take each and every dose of pain medicine we take, and be certain we are taking it for the physical pain for which it was prescribed. The rate of addiction may be less than 1%, but that includes all of us. Take care, Annette""I am glad you found this drug and it worked so well for you. I took 100 mg. of tramadol every morning for years along with my generic MS Contin. I got better and longer pain control with this drug for a long time. I went off of it several times to see if I was correct, and I always ended up using more BT meds, and earlier in the day, and back to the tramadol I went. After 9-10 years of using it, I found it no longer helped much so I stopped it altogether, but I think most folk should at least give it a try. Take care, Annette""Ditto, this needs to be checked out by a qualified doctor. Take care, Annette""It sounds like you already know the answer to your question, volunteering. I force myself to help out at our local animal shelter once a week, it is only an hour or so, I can force myself to do it, even if I don<APO>t feel so good. I always feel better after. I don<APO>t plan anything for the rest of the day or the following morning as far as activities go. I just relax, lol. Keep making the effort to put one foot in front of the other and help at church events. Whatever makes things work for you. I also started belly dancing to TV DVDs, etc. I am up to 60 minutes a day, minimum. I am 61 years old, no previous dance experience, and I won<APO>t be doing it in front of anyone ever. But it is good for me. Find some kind of physical activity that you really enjoy. My doctor started aquasize recently, she loves it and her chronic back pain is decreasing a lot. Take care, Annette""Yes, you can. Side effects from medication usually lessen with time. Discuss this with your doctor. Take care, Annette""If your present doctor doesn<APO>t take care of you properly, try someone else... Sunshine and exercise may be a good starting off place for good health, but it doesn<APO>t sound like you are happy with this regimen. How long have you been seeing this doctor? How long have you been off of the tramadol? Take care, Annette""I would see the dentist as well. You may need xrays to see what is going on. As far as biting your nails, try this trick if you want to quit. Only make one fingernail off limits for the first week, maybe the pinky fingernail on your right hand. The following week, add another fingernail to the off limits one, etc. etc. The doctor who told me about this trick said he had never had a patient who could not quit this way. He felt it made folks more aware of when they were biting their nails and that is half the battle as it is a habit that largely goes un-noticed. I am an old RN, a former patient of mine only had jaw pain when he chewed gum, quitting gum chewing, made his pain gradually go away. Take care, Annette""I would start a pain journal, score your pain 0-10 several times a day, and include meds, times, and activities, and obviously the day your period starts and stops. I don<APO>t know why doctors like seeing things written out, but they do. We also do better if we write things down right away, our memories aren<APO>t as good as we would like to think. I don<APO>t think your body stores the drug and then releases it all at once, I bet it is more how your hormones interact with the meds. Take care, Annette""Good thought, Bren-Bren. I have been in menopause for so long and never did use fentanyl patches anyway, I did not even think of temperature changes due to hormones. Taking your temperature every day is easy, I think the ladies who do it for fertility take it before they even get out of bed, that might be the most accurate way. Take care, Annette""How old are you? My old doctor said menopause can either make headaches better, do nothing, or make them worse. I say that is a one in three chance for improvement, better than many drugs. Take care, Annette""We do not have enough information to give an answer for you. What kind of imaging did the doctor do to diagnose this hair line fracture in the vertebrae of his neck. You cannot put a cast on the person<APO>s neck, so it is not like the example of a fracture of the elbow. Cracking or stretching ones neck is not the same as cracking ones knuckles. A fracture in ones vertebrae may or may not not cause any change in mobility, it depends where it is broken. I had a nurse friend with a ""broken neck"" from an assault, and it did not keep him from moving about in any way. It really is none of your/our business anyway, unless this person asks us for help. Take care, Annette""First, thank you for your contribution to the military. I appreciate the sacrifices both military personnel and their families make for all of us. I would get a consult from a civilian doctor if it is possible for you to do so. It never hurts to have another set of eyes looking at your problem. I have taken Ambien for over ten years now, nearly every night. I get myself into bed before I take it, and do all the usual sleep hygiene stuff also. I make sure I won<APO>t need to be awake and functional for 8 hours after I take the ambien. I started at 10 mg. About 7 years into it, my son the Marine, was on his third combat deployment and I just was not holding up as well as I had the first two times. I went through a lot of insomnia even with the ambien. We tried other sleep aids but nothing worked, my doc finally put me back on the ambien at 15 mg. each night. That has worked well. My son got home same and sound (more or less). Now I take either 10 or 15 mg. a night depending on how I feel. I have no significant side effects at all. I know for a fact though that if I stay up after I take it, it will not put me to sleep. I have to have a hot soak, and go to bed, then take it and stay in bed. It is also best to take it on an empty stomach, and definitely no caffeine. I don<APO>t get any relief from darvocet, in fact a fairly recent medical study showed it was no more useful than plain tylenol in a double blind study for the relief of pain. That said, some people do claim relief so that is often where doctors start treating pain. I would give it a try, go back to your doctor and explain how it works for you and go on from there. Take care, Annette""Surgery should always be the last choice for anyone. No good doctor will guarantee that any surgery will relieve pain. Surgery might help this person avoid pain management, or it might not. Even the percentages for pain relief vary from one specific surgery to another. I find it far easier now to swallow larger pills than little tiny ones, lol. I used to chew birth-control pills, aspirin, etc. in my 20s. But a nice nurse taught me how to swallow pills once while I was in the hospital, now I can swallow handfuls if need be. I am in my 60s now. Take care, Annette""I have been seeing doctors for over 15 years for daily opioid prescriptions, and have never been required to see them every month. Never, ever, even in the beginning. I do not know how new this person is to pain management, but I do agree with you that as you build up trust a doctor may require less of you to prove you are being a good patient. I have worked with doctors for many years and have seen my share of them as a patient, they have never complained of the DEA breathing down their necks, it may be true in other areas, I don<APO>t personally know. I have also found different practices in different geographical areas. Schedule II meds do require a hard copy RX walked into the pharmacy by the patient or his representative, no calls in for refills etc. like you said, However, Schedule I meds are not to be prescribed at all, as they have no medical use, things like heroin and marijuana. Schedule III, IV, and V can be called in by phone and have different rules than schedule II. Oxycontin, methadone, and fentanyl are examples of schedule II drugs, Vicodin is an example of schedule III drugs. I am not sure what you meant by ""and higher"" in your last paragraph. Higher might mean more restrictive rules, or it might mean schedule numbers III, IV, and V. Take care, Annette""Why would you not have told the doctor giving you RXs for pain meds, ALL of the meds you are currently taking? That is your job. Take care, Annette""Every state has its own laws, and every practice has its own rules for opioid RXs. The federal government under the DEA has its own minimum requirements or laws for opioid prescriptions. The laws written by the federal and state government are not negotiable. The group practice rules may be, depending on the doctor. I think it is important to know the difference starting out. Do some research on your state laws where you live. I live in Oregon and see my doctor once every three months, she gives me three properly dated RXs of each schedule II med, with her own handwritten instructions not to fill them prior to a particular date. That way I fill them once a month. I have signed a contract with her, every office may have their own caveats, so read whatever you have signed and keep a copy for yourself. Just always know that if you break those rules in your contract the doctor can dismiss you immediately. If you sign it, it is probably binding. Take care, Annette""You do have something to fear if the drug for anxiety that you take has not been disclosed to the doctor writing the RX for pain meds. Take care of this right away. By the way, the interaction of benzodiazepines (one kind of drug for anxiety) and opioids is up to who you read lately. Some doctors do not believe in mixing these two drug families at all, some don<APO>t mind. If you are taking one of the benzos, you might be asked to choose between the benzo and the opioid. Do your reading and go to the appt. prepared. Take care, Annette""""Feeling Good"" is one of the best books I have ever read. Do whatever you think is the best thing for you. I would not share in a 12 step program that I used prescribed pain meds, I just do not trust anyone enough. My friend went through AA and different alcohol/addiction related programs, and they often teach that any use of opiates , even proper use of prescribed opiates means addiction, not true. I might share other aspects of my recovery process though. As far as I am concerned ""clean"" means free of alcohol, and abuse of prescribed meds. Clean can include the proper use of prescribed meds as far as I am concerned. YOU DO NOT NEED TO BE A MARTYR TO CHRONIC PAIN. Anytime you wish to share how long you have been clean, it would be nice to know. How did it go with your doctor appt.? Take care, Annette""Hi, Sorry I did not respond sooner, I must have missed this post entirely. I would suggest keeping a symptom journal, I know it sounds like a lot of work, but i found it helpful when I applied for SSDI. Hang in there with the neurontin, it does not take care of pain in the same way as a ""pain"" pill. I never really felt it start to work, but later when I forgot to take a dose I felt a big difference in my pain levels. It helps in more subtle ways. Hemochromatosis is a fairly common diagnosis, and easily dealt with as far as treatment goes, good idea for her to check you for it. HCV is also an interesting diagnosis. The CDC is starting to say that maybe every one in the baby boomer generation should be screened for this. Do you have it? The problem with ""flu like symptoms"" is that they can be laid at the door of so many different illnesses. Have you had your thyroid checked yet? Keep in touch. Take care, Annette""I am so glad you mentioned education, I also feel this is so important in managing our own health issues. I have used Dr. Margaret Caudill, MD, PhD<APO>s book, ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"", it is a great book, I got it at our local big box book store. I have also seen it advertised in an on line Nurse<APO>s book store. I also have read and shared, ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns MD. It is also very good and I have used techniques from this book, it literally saved my life. Also available anywhere in the self help section of a quality book store. Each book cost about $20 new, but I have also seen them at thrift shops, really cheap. Thanks Dr. A for writing your own book, I will read it as soon as I can. I really feel one can always gain something by reading a book if they are open to learning at all. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I must disagree with part of your post. A number of folks have posted here that they got their methadone for their chronic pain at a methadone clinic for addiction. I do agree that it is not a good choice. Doctors can use methadone for chronic pain, I use it and have never had any kind of addiction issue, my husband used it in the past twice for chronic pain issues, and he also has not ever had any kind of addiction. The dosing, and the frequency of dosing is very different than that for addiction. It cannot be used legally outside of an addiction clinic for addiction. I doubt there are any laws to deal with using it for chronic pain at these clinics if you pass their entry rules. I do not know the present status of the buprenorphene type drugs, my 2010-2011 drug hand book states that one type should only be used for addiction and one type for pain. It also states that a doctor must have specific addiction training to use it for addiction. I know nothing personally, having never used these drugs at all. Dosing, etc. can be found on line or in a drug handbook. Having worked with opiate type drug addicts and methadone back in the early 1970s, I really respect opiate addiction and would rather have chronic pain than addiction. I also really respect methadone, you are so right that you never take more than is prescribed to you, no doubling up the dose because you are having more pain. A recovering addict who has pain issues is really caught between a rock and a hard place. Given a choice I would suggest a pain clinic that also has addiction help, but I know clinics like that are few and far between, especially for someone with $$ and insurance issues. I hate our healthcare system. Good luck, and take care, Annette""I have had good experiences with my pcps also. Maybe your pcp lost patients entirely to the PM doc, because they were basically healthy to start out with. The only reason I even see my doctor is for pain management and PAP tests once every 3-5 years. Without the pain management, I would probably go to a local Planned Parenthood type clinic for my PAP tests and never see my pcp at all. I am not saying this is a good thing, just one explanation that came to mind. Take care, Annette""Hi, I am not sure who this is posted to, everyone I guess. This thread is the first time I have ever heard of this problem, I have been both a pain patient and an RN for many years. I suspect this is a geographical problem, as are some of the rules and state laws concerning pcps even prescribing opioids. Where I live, pcps can prescribe opioids for chronic pain patients indefinitely, not for six months as Swank said is the the law where she lives. I would appreciate it if everyone would just tell us what part of the country they are residing in. I have moved from one state to another, and from one part of a state to another, and changed primary care doctors without any problems at all. I live in Oregon now, and have previously lived in Nevada and Calif. Some doctors do not want to take patients who see certain other doctors for legal reasons, they do not want to be swept up in a lawsuit along with other healthcare providers just because they were a part of the patients care. This does happen occasionally. I have followed my present pcp from place to place because I really like her. She moved from her own solo practice to a large group practice a couple of years ago. The did have me fill out all of their forms including a medication list of my current meds as a new patient even though I had seen her for over ten years. This was done as I was there for my first appt. with her in that clinic, but before I saw her. No one said a word about me taking methadone and oxycodone along with two other meds commonly used by pain management patients. I was considered a ""new"" patient there. That would have been the time to be asked to leave if I am reading the other posts correctly. I am not calling anyone a liar or accusing anyone of doing anything wrong, so please no one get defensive. I am just seeking more information and participating in this discussion. Take care, Annette""That is terrible. I have not experienced this since my pcp also takes care of my pain med RXs. I have seen a pain management specialist a couple of time to see if he had anything new to suggest. He did not. I believe that the fewer doctors one sees the fewer mistakes might happen. I do believe in specialists when one really needs them. My husband got his pain meds from his pcp also, no problem. That is just horrible. Perhaps it is geographic at this point??? We live in Oregon. Take care, Annette""People with chronic pain might get high, if they took enough drugs. There is no medical study that shows what you suggest to be true that I am aware of. Please send me a link, anybody, if you have one. There is no way for anyone to tell by looking at you whether you are an addict looking for pills, or a chronic pain patient looking for pills. I wish there was a test of some kind for healthcare folk to do to tell us from drug abusers, but there is not. I hope you find a good doctor soon to look after all of your needs. Take care, Annette""I have NEVER been asked on any form if I was on pain management. This is why we are having this discussion. Take care, Annette""That is why I asked folks to post where they were living. I think it is a geographic issue. I personally think that the people who are pushing to get medical marijuana laws passed, are actually more interested in decriminalizing or legalizing pot entirely. I wish everyone would just be honest about the whole issue. Although I am for decriminalizing pot, I really feel that the whole ""medical marijuana"" thing is nonsense. We need to do a whole lot more research, especially on long term side effects, first. Take care, Annette""Thanks for letting us know where you live. Take care, Annette""I also tried it, and it did not work at all for my pain, I just got high as a kite. I spoke to a neurologist in Idaho, he said he could not obtain any legally or do the medical studies he wanted to do. He told me how he recommended his patient use it, and I followed his instructions. Different strokes for different folks, lol. I just want it to be available for more research studies for medicinal use. But, be honest about your reasons for legalizing it. Take care, Annette""I have used baclofen also, it works great, but has become very sedating for me, even at 5 mg. at bedtime, I am zonked for the next whole day. My RX says I can take 10 mg. three times a day. I am so glad it is working for you. Take care, Annette""I do not know why my post to you did not go through, but other ones I wrote did, I am sorry if it was me, could have been. What I said was that this discussion is about folks who cannot find a PCP after they start PM. That the PCPs ask if they are on PM and if they are, they refuse to see them. It sounds to me like you did not have this problem in OR, rather you feel that you got lousy care from your specialists, but that your PCP kept you on.. is that correct? Or did I misunderstand you? I am glad that you are finally getting the kind of pain management that you want. Take care, Annette""The problem being discussed is that people cannot get a PCP once they have a PM doctor, the PCPs refuse to accept them as patients. It sounds like this was not the problem that you had. You feel you did not get high quality pain management care in OR, but did when you moved elsewhere...is that true? I am glad you feel better now. Take care, Annette""I am sorry I misunderstood your original post. I would not move back to Oregon if I were you, at least not until I found a doctor I liked. I have decided that I must find a doctor first, then move, kind of like the old days when I was working, and I found a job first, then moved. My pcp suggested an urgent care place one time when she could not fit me in at the office on the same day for an ear infection. She was 30 minutes away and knew the urgent care place was just down the street from me. I went, they asked the usual questions about meds and why I was taking them, etc. I answered honestly, they saw me and prescribed an antibiotic. I was in and out in less than an hour. I have to say if I had had your experiences I probably would have moved away a long time ago. Take care, Annette""They have a chart on you, if you have even been there one other time. I have been to urgent care once at the suggestion of my pcp, but my husband has been there 3-4 times for work related cuts and stitches. As a nurse, I would have to say they almost always need to know ALL your medications to prevent drug interactions even if all they give you is an antibiotic. I don<APO>t see a different doctor for PM my pcp manages my pain for me. Any nurse or doctor could tell by reading my medication list that I have chronic pain. Do you with hold this or other medical information from them? Take care, Annette""I hope they treated your infection? Did they do that, or did they tell you to leave or did you get sick of their questions and choose to leave? Where I live in Oregon several doctors have offered me RXs for opiates for various acute injuries that I have handed back to them saying I had a contract with my pcp to only get opiates from her. Same thing happened to my husband when he was on pain management. I have seen the ER from the other side as an ER nurse, and it is very sad the stories I have heard from addicts trying to get drugs, people have no idea haw frequently that happens and the crazy stories we hear. Unfortunately, lots of doctors now start out an evaluation by saying they do not prescribe opiates for chronic pain. In the ER where I worked in NV the pain was what the patient said it was. A fair number of addicts probably got drugs from our doctors but at least the patients with real pain also got treated. The entire situation is sad, we all wish there was some kind of blood test or imaging test that proved a patient had pain. Until then we will probably continue to see this. You are lucky that your medical system uses electronic charts and every one in the system has access to them, not all of us are so lucky. My husband and I have different doctors, his does that, mine does not. Neither sends records to the urgent care clinic that is closest to us and sees patients the fastest. Take care, Annette""If I may ask, and only answer if you feel comfortable doing so, what state do you live in? Take care, Annette""This site is anonymous, you do not have to give your name. I would suggest you tell your friends who have been discriminated against to post themselves. No one who posts here ever loses their medical care. Take care, Annette""I have never been asked at that phase of making an appt. over the phone with a pcp<APO>s office staff if I was on pain management at all. Doctors staff will often tell you that they do not prescribe pain meds for chronic pain, but that is as far as the discussion has ever gotten with me. Have you personally experienced this? It seems to me if a PM doctor moved away, his patients would be looking for another PM doctor, not a pcp. Take care, Annette""I hope you at least always tell them all your drug allergies. There are cross sensitivities, esp. between sulfa drugs and some meds used in pain management. I am glad you have a pharmacist on your team, I think they are under-appreciated healthcare professionals. Mine have always been very useful. By the way, your own doctor is correct in only prescribing antibiotics when he knows for sure there is an infection. I have bladder irritation that gives me symptoms of a bladder infection all the time, but no infection. I was on and off antibiotics several times before they figured it out. Now I take something that helps the symptoms but no antibiotic, works great. Even disagreeing with a doctor can get you tossed out of some offices if they do not know you already. Take care, Annette""Being treated with disrespect or a healthcare professional being judgemental might be different from being discriminated against according to me and my dictionary both. I would consider it just plain rude, but not necessarily discriminatory. This is why communicating on line can be difficult, we all have our own definition and word usage. Take care, Annette""Thank you, that makes five people who responded. One in Georgia, one in Pennsylvania, two of us in Oregon, and you in Texas. I really appreciate you posting this info, and hope others will too. Take care, Annette""I thought you did not get the shot after all? Did you? Do you think your pain doctor will be angry that you even asked for something, even if you did not get it? Do you still have a pcp? If you do not mind saying, what state do you live in? Take care, Annette""Ditto, I use drugs, but also other things. I, like Beth, have had a totally different experience than Timmy59, thank goodness. Timmy59, please come back and tell us more about what is going on with you. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t really get this at all. I have changed pcps a number of times while on opiates due to moving mostly. I do not recommend telling the person setting up your appt. any more than you need to, but I believe you need to be totally honest with the doctor at your first appt. I have been, and have not had a problem. I still suspect this is a geographical thing, where do you all live? I live in Oregon and have always lived on the West Coast or in Nevada. Take care, Annette""Yeah, as long as your pain management doctor and your surgeon are on the same page, everything should be fine. When I had surgery, my surgeon asked me to go see a pain management specialist as a consult since my internist prescribes my pain meds. I saw a guy who I had seen once before, and he suggested I take up to 20 mg. of oxycodone every 4-6 hours as needed for pain, along with my regular methadone dose. Since my internist already had ordered that much for BT pain, I did not need to get any additional meds from the surgeon. I agree with you, just call your doctor prior to filling any RXs and ask what to do. Better safe than sorry. Take care, Annette""There is some disagreement about whether or not tramadol is an opioid or not. My drug handbook for advanced practice nurses states it is an opioid analgesic. I have found that some doctors like it and some don<APO>t. Like you say, it certainly is not a schedule II or III drug. Take care, Annette""I was not taking Percocet, just plain oxycodone. Percocet has acetaminophen in it. I was already taking 15 -20 mg. of oxycodone for BT pain, usually I took 15 mg. at a time. It turned out I only needed 15 mg. at a time even after the surgery. I did take it a bit more often than usual for a few days postop. I have been on daily opioid therapy for about 14 or 15 years now. It is not a particularly high dose for folks who have been taking daily opioids, many folks who post here take 30 mg. or more at one time. It is definitely higher than an opioid naive person would take. Take care, Annette""In my experience plain old ibuprofen is the best thing for dental work, I find it works far better than oxycodone. For me, anyway. I happen to agree with your doctor, I prefer that one doctor write all my RXs. I actually suggested that to my internist when I first started seeing her. She wasn<APO>t used to doing things that way back then. That was 13-14 years ago. Take care, Annette""Write to the doctor that you have the contract with, and ask the office staff to send you a copy of the contract for your files. Be sure to include your date of birth, name, and address. If you have an account number, include that. If it is easier go to the office and request this, and sign for it. They need to have written authorization to be in compliance with the HIPAA laws. Also make an appt. to see this doctor right away, and tell him in person what happened with the doc that did the injections. Ask him exactly what you can take from other doctors and what you need to do in the future. I had a contract with my pcp as she manages my pain meds, and also had surgery. The surgeon offered me a RX for pain meds for the initial two weeks after surgery, I declined to take them, I did fill other RXs she gave me before surgery. When I mentioned all this to my own pcp at my pre-op exam, she didn<APO>t care at all, she didn<APO>t care if the surgeon wrote for pain meds for two weeks after surgery or not. She said she didn<APO>t worry about me, because I had never given her reason to. This does not mean you should take whatever they offer you, I think you have done things correctly so far as you know how to do. It just means don<APO>t freak out about it, just ask the doc what to do next time. Take care, Annette""Narcotic is an old fashioned word, more often used by lay people. Personally, I would ask the doctor to be more specific about what kinds of meds are included. Medically the word narcotic can mean drugs that make you tend to be sleepy as a direct effect, or a side effect. It is derived from the word ""narcosis"". Many people use the words opiates and narcotics interchangably nowadays though. Hard to say what his intent is. Take care, Annette""See the doctor who is demanding this in person, not on the phone or by talking to his nurse or other representative. Ultram is a pain med, so that may be the problem. But, you will not know until you talk to the doctor himself. I do not see any problem with the Imitrex either, but like I said, Talk to the doctor, he should know what the problem is. Only you know the best thing to do meanwhile, she gave you a choice, how much Imitrex do you have at home? How often do you get migraines? I would personally choose to fill the pain meds if I could not get an appt. immediately to straighten this out, but that is me, not you. I also have chronic pain and migraines, so I know the dilemma you find yourself in. Take care, Annette""Unfortunately, ALL pain killers can cause rebound headaches, not just opioids. This is why it is important to get the right migraine specific meds for migraines. It took me many years to figure this out. Imitrex was the only triptan-type drug available back in my early days after migraine diagnosis, but there are also non-triptan drugs that have worked for migraines according to studies. Take care, Annette""Many Pain Management specialists have little to no training in managing migraines, I know I have asked two of my PM doctors, both declined to treat migraines. If you can find a PM doctor who is also trained in managing migraines, fine, but I would suggest if your family doctor can<APO>t do it, to see a migraine specialist. If your family doctor<APO>s preferred treatment for migraines is to use OTC or RX pain pills more than three times a week, he is not up on migraine care, I would find another doctor for this quickly changing problem. Take care, Annette""I am certain from personal experience and research that there is no difference between name brand and generic, but frankly I have had no experience with compounding pharmacies. I don<APO>t know what their quality assurance consists of, but I would sure ask before using one. I would want to view their compounding area to make certain of cleanliness, accuracy, etc. My friend has had no problems at all getting endocet, is using an oxycodone/tylenol preparation an option for you until this shortage is over? As long as you have no prior liver problems and take the minimum amount of tylenol (under 4,000 mg. total per day) you should be okay. Discuss this with your doctor and ask him if it would work for you. Take care, Annette""Sorry, bren<UD>bren, I have not been on the computer or missed this post or both, lol. I found with gabapentin that I continued to increase my daily dose until I did have relief after a week on a steady dose. I got up to 1800 mg. a day, other people have gone higher. Then I went down again very slowly, until I hit 900 mg. After awhile I just asked my doctor to put me on whatever was the closest dose that I could take in one pill. She decided the 800 mg. pill should work for me and it has. I personally feel that one needs to stay on the dose that works as far as the gabapentin goes for several months, then try backing off a bit very slowly. I have not had a problem with heat bothering my own nerve pain issues. I sit in my hot tub every night before bed. I do not have experience with hip labral tears either personally or with patients I have had over the years. I never did much orthopedic work. My husband had a hip replacement four years ago for AVN, he recovered well, and described it as an easy surgery. I would check out various orthopedic surgeons in your area, and on your insurance, make appts. with several that take care of a lot of hips and see who you like the best. Take care, Annette PS, the only silly ? is one you don<APO>t ask.""No problem. Don<APO>t let your mind jump to something horrible or difficult first thing. I would assume that laying on the hard pack made you hurt due to bruising or whatever. Mention it to the doctor next time you see him. Or call before then if you wish. I have learned that belly dancing to a new instructor on my DVDs causes new and different pain in my hips because I use slightly different muscles. After it happened 2-3 times, I understood what was going on. Now I plan ahead and expect the bit of extra pain. Are you maxed on imaging due to insurance, or because you do not want any more radiation right now? Take care, Annette""Yes, I am still belly dancing. Every night, for at least an hour, sometimes longer. I love it, and it is great exercise. I have lost just over 50 pounds without changing my diet at all. I should, but not yet, lol. If you are maxed out on MRIs due to insurance, just see a good clinician when you see a doctor. I remember when we didn<APO>t have MRIs at all, hadn<APO>t been invented yet. They are great when you really need one, but we did manage without. When does your insurance allow it again? As for the labral tear: another interpretation, might be ""doesn<APO>t mean it IS there"". If the radiologist was not sure, and you had no symptoms at the time, I would not worry about that. I have FMS as one of my major diagnoses, some call it a garbage can diagnosis, although I don<APO>t. I do understand what you are saying when you do not have a definitive diagnosis. It has just been so long I don<APO>t worry so much anymore. I can<APO>t say that I decreased my opioids at the time I started gabapentin, but it did make me feel better, and perhaps I did not increase my dose as often since then. I keep a written log of all my opioids along with comments and dates, etc. It helps me identify flare ups and why they happen. That helps me accept that they happen, and they do go away. Take care of yourself. Annette""Hi, Bren-bren Be careful about laying on top of heating pads, it is very easy to burn your skin. Most of them tell you in the directions not to do that. I am curious as to the difference between sciatic nerve irritation and true sciatica? What is the difference? I would avoid any kind of imaging tests until the doctor feels it is needed enough to order it. If he thinks it is right to wait and see, then do that. I think MRIs are grossly over-ordered, just my opinion. So the gabapentin is helping the nerve pain, that is a good thing. What I have read about BT meds is that if you are taking more than 2-3 doses a day, you might discuss with your doctor increasing your long acting meds. There is a formula somewhere out there for you to estimate what your dose should be. A PM doc figured mine out prior to me having surgery 18 months ago. I recently got to where I was having pain at a 6-8 score all the time and taking my BT meds every four hours while awake. I talked to my doctor about it and increased my methadone 2 of 3 doses per day from 5 to 10 mg., now all three doses I take are 10 mg. each. I am taking my BT meds only once or twice a day most days. I think this is a good thing. Hang in there, you will do fine, this will pass. You will feel better after it is all straightened out. Take care, Annette""I personally think sciatica is sciatica, as long as a doctor diagnoses it. You know how I feel about self diagnosis, lol. Sometimes sciatica may feel worse, but to me it is a matter of degree that you are talking about. I would assume that your pain or your response to the pain is different, before I would assume the pills are different. My pharmacy always tells me if they have two batches of drugs in to fill a RX, and they put them in different bottles, with the different lot numbers on them. Ask your pharmacist if your store mixes two different batches in one bottle. I don<APO>t think the FDA allows that. Tell them what you have said here and ask what they think? I think most people under-rate their pharmacist as a member of their health care team, I have found them to be VERY helpful. They seem to like not being thought of as just pill counters. I think your theory that your fentanyl levels were higher is a good one, keep records of the times of the fentanyl, and the BT med and how much you take each time. Score your pain and the times also. This way you can see trends that you might miss otherwise. Take care, Annette PS-Do not try and please the doctors, just tell them the truth about how you are feeling.""Methadone and a very few other pain drugs are not related in anyway to codeine.Talk to your doctor about all of this. Take care, Annette""It sounds to me like your pcp has to see you and determine if indeed you had a seizure, before the neurologists want to get involved. If your doctor (pcp) thinks it was a seizure and that it is important that you be seen right away, he will arrange it for you. He does not want the legal responsibility on him alone anyhow. Take care, Annette""I went to the first site you provided a link to and did not find flexeril or its generic name on the list at the bottom of the page. It also did not say that these meds ""cause"" seizures but that they might ""provoke"" seizures, and that folks who have seizures already might discuss with their doctors taking alternate drugs. It did not say they should not take these drugs, just to discuss it with their doctor. A ""full table"" of other meds does include flexeril but not ""in withdrawal"". This site is dealing with folks who have epilepsy or a history of seizures, I think. Do you have any history of seizures before this episode? I did not find who sponsored this site, do you happen to know? It is important to find this out so you can get an idea about where they collect their information. Take care, Annette""The kind of seizures that people have when they drink too much is completely different from what you described yourself as having. I don<APO>t believe there is a genetic link between your uncle<APO>s seizures and what you have experienced. Why would you assume that it is the flexeril and not the other drugs you are taking? Why do you think they would not put ""in withdrawal"" after the flexeril as they did with the other types of drugs like Soma if that is true? None of those drugs ""cause"" seizures, they only are said at that site to ""provoke"" them. They do not even suggest stopping those meds, just discussing them with your doctor. The disease of epilepsy is different than a seizure caused by alcohol or medication withdrawal, or even fevers in babies. Why would you listen to info about a friend of a friend who might have had seizures that might have been caused by stress? These ""seizures"" were not even suffered by someone YOU know. Did you ever play telephone when you were little, and sitting in a circle, whisper something in your neighbor<APO>s ear, and see the difference between what you said and what the last person said? All I have said all along is that you need to see your doctor for a proper evaluation, testing, and diagnosis. I do not believe in doing a symptom match-up on line first, and deciding for yourself what is wrong with you. I think using specific sites that your doctor recommends to learn more about a disease you have been diagnosed with by a real doctor is what the internet is for. Don<APO>t ever self diagnose based on general symptoms and the internet. Take care, Annette""Benzos are well known to cause seizures when stopped suddenly. This has been known for many years. I am so sorry your doctor was unaware of this when he told you to stop taking it, rather than tapering off slowly. Take care, Annette""Pseudo means not real. Talk to your doctor again. Take care, Annette""Please see a doctor about this, a neurologist is the proper specialty for seizures. I am not convinced this was actually a seizure though, he will know and can do tests that will determine what is going on. Take care, Annette""Please do see a doctor for a proper diagnosis. They can examine you and also get blood tests, and other tests that you may need. In your specific case an EEG over time would show your brain waves and make a diagnosis much easier as brain waves change during any kind of seizure. The symptoms of many different illnesses can be the same, the internet cannot see you or do any tests at all. Some sites are very reliable, other not so much. In other words, there are lots of completely inaccurate things on the internet as well as helpful things. Take care, Annette""I would make an appt. and once you get there, refuse to leave without this being dealt with to your satisfaction. All joking (or not) aside, are you seeing the same doctor each time? That helps, do you see a doctor in between times or just on the occasions you mentioned? I am concerned about any skin changes you may have, from color changes to temperature changes, as these can be symptoms of RSD, and that can be serious. I would suggest you keep a symptom journal, write down measurements, color changes, etc. Take photos if you can, of both legs so the doctor can compare them. Pain scores, etc. Take care, Annette""Mpathia, I agree with Peskypain that you should see the Gastroenterologist who did the colonoscopy, and also see a rheumy who manages FMS patients for that. Two out of three of the PM doctors I have seen for consults over the years have been wonderful, caring individuals, the third wasn<APO>t a bad person, she and I just didn<APO>t see eye to eye on doing procedures. I did not want them and declined to have them, we parted ways amicably. FMS makes recovery from any kind of painful procedures last longer and hurt more in my experience. I recovered from a painful knee in six months that another (non-FMS) person might have recovered from in six weeks. I have found that going into these things knowing what to expect works wonders. You don<APO>t worry so much, and that alone makes you heal faster. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""I would go back to your primary care doctor (I think you call them GPs) and ask him what kind of specialist to see next, tell him what your symptoms are at present. Be sure and tell him how severe things are at present and that the meds you have received so far don<APO>t work. Take a list or the actual meds in their bottles. I am sorry, I am not familiar with the healthcare system in Canada, and do not know how one gets referrals to specialists. Keep in touch. Take care, Annette""That does make some sense, they do not want to intrude on the rheumatologist and his work with you. How do you guys up north get family doctors, do you have to wait to be assigned one? Can you find one on your own? I do stretches and also exercise for at least an hour every single day, yuck. I do belly dancing along with DVDs on the TV set at home at night. It does not get rid of or improve the pain itself, but it does make me feel globally better, stronger, and less likely to fall as I age. I have FMS and DDD in my cervical spine. I am currently 61 and have had these things for over 15 years now. I have only been exercising for about three years now, I wish I had started many years ago. Take care, and please do keep in touch. Annette""You should not have ""blisters and burns and discoloration"" on your skin from a heating pad. You should always put a towel between your skin and a heating pad or hot water bottle, and the device should always be on top of your legs or lower back, not under them. It should only be applied for 20 minutes on and 20 minutes off at the most. I have found that honesty is the best policy with all doctors. Tell him exactly what your pain prevents you from doing, and what kind of reaction you are having to any meds. Don<APO>t use the word allergy, tell him what symptoms you have had. Let him decide whether to call it an allergy or not. Take care, Annette""I do not really think that at 16 weeks one should expect the pain to be completely gone. My left knee has swollen up and hurt severely twice about five years apart, seemingly for no reason, at least no trauma. The first time I saw my rheumy and after examining me and ordering xrays, he was not really worried about it and it did go away after 8-12 weeks. The second time was about five years later, same thing, swelling and pain, but no trauma. My PCP repeated the xrays (they looked the same), and suggested I see an orthopedist. I talked her into some oral steroids, and finally saw the orthopedist when I finished them and was taking OTC NSAIDs. He explained why they do MRIs and did not really think one was needed yet. He said there was one ligament that the MRI does not show, so even if the MRI were normal, I could have damaged that one ligament, and surgery to take a look see would be necessary. He did agree to watchful waiting. This time the pain and swelling lasted about 24 weeks total, but did go away, and it has been more than ten years since the last time it bothered me. I am a good bit older than you, I am 61, and have FMS which can alter my pain response (not the swelling though) while healing. If you trust your healthcare providers, I would just do what they suggest. What have all these specialists told you to do about the pain you are having? Can you avoid the situations that cause pain for awhile? Take care, Annette""Allah does not care if you kneel while praying or not. He will hear your prayers no matter what position you are in. Please do not feel embarrassed, probably no one notices but you. It takes a long time to strengthen muscles, do the exercises that the PT suggests, and see your doctor when he wants you to. My Hero, is my nephew, he was born with orthopedic problems and cannot kneel at all, he has never been able to. His knees only bend to about 85-90 degrees ever. He is a great drummer though. He is 18 now, and I am so proud of him. Take care, Annette""Best of luck to you. I prefer a stick shift, but gave them up some years ago due to health issues. I am used to an automatic now, but it took getting used to. Take care, Annette""I would start with your PCP, and depending on what his evaluation shows, pick a specialist, if you need one. Take care, Annette""Angelswife, I agree with our good doctor, please see a doctor who specializes in RSD (CRPS) as soon as possible. I have read many times that the sooner treatment is started the better off you are. As far as the pain meds go, talk to the RSD specialist and ask him what kind of meds might help at this point. Then do your own research and discuss it with your surgeon. In my opinion, and in my own experience with a neurosurgeon after spinal surgery, surgeons are not trained in pain management, they always want you off of opiates as soon as possible. See a doctor who is trained and experienced in pain management. Take care, Annette""I would really think twice about joining the military with a bum knee or hip. My son was an active duty Marine for 8 years, and they did a lot of hiking/ walking with lots of gear, up and down hills etc. He calls it ""humping"". I am sure the Army does something similar. My son got two bad knees out of it, they were fine when he went into the Marines at age 22. Not so fine now. You mentioned that your knee gets worse with physical activity. I suggest you see your doctor and be evaluated, find out what is wrong for sure and deal with it. Take care, Annette""Depending on what state you live in, you may have had uninsured motorist coverage that might help you with your medical expenses. Check with your insurance company. Take care, Annette""Hi, swank Many folk like you and I wait until something really hurts or we have other symptoms then we have surgery. However, there are some folk who opt to have surgery the second something is diagnosed rather than ""wait until it gets bad"". Unfortunately, as far as I am concerned, many doctors are willing to do surgeries right away. Hernias can be happen in several places in the body, but I think like you do, that this person is talking about a herniated disc in his back. All a hernia is, is a hole in a membrane that allows the stuff on one side to get to the other side. Abdominal hernias are holes in the membrane around the intestines that allow the intestines to ooze through the hole and become constricted. Herniated discs are holes in the membrane around the disc that allows the gel inside the disc to leak out. So much for Anatomy 101, lol. Good info for newbies, I guess. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know the answer to this question, perhaps your doctor or podiatrist knows.....? What kind of symptoms are you having now? Take care, Annette""Please see your own doctor for a good evaluation and diagnosis. Let him or her know about your anxiety disorder, let them treat that as well as any physical problems. My best advice is to avoid eating caffeine or anything that makes you feel sick. There are elimination diets that can help you figure out what you can and cannot eat safely. Talk to your doctor. My internal medicine doctor said to take prenatal vitamins for hair thinning, she had read some medical studies about it working, and had a few patients that felt positively about it. I had a normal thyroid test also. They are just over the counter vitamins, so they should be safe until you get an okay from your own doctor. If you do not feel good talking to your won doctor about all your issues, get a doctor that does make you feel comfortable. Take care, Annette""Eating well and getting enough exercise always comes first. Do you have an albuterol inhaler for your asthma? An ER doctor that I used to work with had asthma, as did 2 of his 3 little boys. They were all very active, he suggested folks with exercise induced asthma use their albuterol about 15 minutes prior to starting any exercise. Discuss this with your doctor before trying it of course. If you are sedentary, talk to your doctor first before you start any exercise program. Just mall walking is fine to start out with. I do about 10 minutes of weights, then 60-90 minutes of bellydancing to DVDs on the TV daily. It is a program I can do at home any time of the night or day. It is also something to work towards, not do all at once. Works for me. I would suggest you find a doctor you like and stick with him/her all the time. I think it is best to build a relationship with a doctor and stick with the same one all the time. YAHOO for your mom, nurses are great!!! I know as I am one, albeit retired. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know where you live, but out here in the far west, there is no ""pill limit"" that I have ever heard of. I get far more than 90 pills a month of each of my schedule II opioid pain meds each month. There is some controversy about cancer pain and non-cancer pain, I do not think there is much difference between them myself. I prefer mild, moderate, or severe pain, but it does seem to matter if it is neurogenic pain or not. Some opioids seem to work better than others on neurogenic pain. I have mixed feelings about implanted pain medicine pumps. First, I prefer that surgical options be the last thing tried when all else has failed. If oral opioids do not work for you and you have already tried other forms of pain control, then an implanted device of some kind might be your next choice. Also with things like the pump, you must consider financial costs. If you lose your insurance what would you do? One person who posted on this forum several years ago found herself in this situation. She could not get her pump refilled with medication, and could not get the pump removed either, she could not afford either. She was asking about oral meds to try. An implanted pump does not eliminate the possibility of overdose, as the practitioner who fills it might cause you to overdose by missing the port and injecting all that medication anyhow. it has happened. Infection is a constant possibility also with someone sticking a needle in you periodically. You are correct about diversion though. These are all things to consider when you come to making that decision. Take care, Annette""Do you have an addiction problem? If so, I would suggest a pain management clinic that also has an addictions specialist. If you do not have an addiction problem, then you have to ask yourself if opioids actually help your pain, if they do why would you feel like you do not want to use them? There are some non-addictive type drugs, antidepressants, anti-seizure meds, etc. that you might try. There are also some non-drug treatments to try. Are you seeing a pain management specialist? Do you feel like he/she is someone you can really talk to? Take care, Annette""If you are taking suboxone for addiction to opiates, it is certainly the right of any pain management doctor to opt not to give you the opiates to which you have an addiction. Perhaps you need to speak to a PM doctor who has a professional relationship with an addiction specialist. Maybe that PM office does not have an addiction specialist. You may have to go see a PM doctor in a university medical center setting. Did the doctor who prescribes your suboxone suggest you go back on opiates? Or do you think you should? Who suggested it first? Did you ask him if he ever talked to the PM doctor that left you the phone message? Opiate addiction and chronic pain are two very difficult things to manage by themselves, let alone together. You are a recovering drug addict, why should you get to decide what drugs any doctor will prescribe to you? I would not give up on this, I would talk to the addiction doctor and ask him what to do next. Take care, Annette""Okay I went back and read my reply to an anonymous poster, that I assume was you. It is difficult to follow conversations when the name changes. I did call you a recovering addict later in that post, in paragraph 3. I should have said ""If you are a recovering addict..."". However, in this post that I am responding to now, you said yourself ""I have admitted to being addicted."" So, what exactly is the problem? I currently see my pcp for PM treatment, not a PM specialist. I have always gotten treatment for chronic pain from my various pcps, not a PM specialist, it has been nearly 20 years now. You see who you like, or who you think is best for you. Take care, Annette""I hope the gabapentin is at least worth discussing with your doctor. I would question having 8 back surgeries....are they helping? Eight since when? For what? I have had one spinal surgery on my neck for functional problems, and the surgeon said when the next disc up herniated, deal with it. He declined to do anything more. He didn<APO>t feel it would be worthwhile. I have to agree now, although I was a bit perturbed back then. After about two years, that herniated disc was as good as the one they had operated on. Not great, but doable. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Pain pumps are okay as a last resort, as is any surgical procedure. Just remember that if your financial situation changes, you may not be bale to get it either refilled or removed. A person who posted here a few years back had no more health insurance after life changed, and that was what she said happened to her. I have not had one myself, so I would not know personally. Take care, Annette""Usually, if you see a PM doctor in certain areas you have signed a contract with him not to get opiates from any other doctor. That may be why the ER doctor refused to give you an injection. Your BP reading of almost 150/100 is not a solid indicator of pain, as chronic pain can either affect the BP or not affect it at all. This doctor may not have had your previous records at hand to tell what your normal BP was. Medically, it just is not an indicator of chronic pain. Were you drinking when you fell at work? That might be an indication of alcoholism. I am glad to hear you are no longer a drinker. That should be considered when you are taking opioids. I always believe in starting with the least invasive treatment first, and then work your way up. Take care, Annette""I take gababpentin, a relative of Lyrica, a slightly older drug. I have lost weight over the last few years. I really don<APO>t think we can blame our weight loss or gain on drugs generally speaking. I tried Lyrica and it did not do any better than gabapentin which was generic here and much cheaper. I am in the US. I take methadone now for chronic pain, and oxycodone for BT pain. I really do not think the oxycodone is dangerous. It is what is in the Oxycontin, just is immediate acting rather than long acting. Do your own research, and get second opinions for anything you are not sure about. Take care, Anentte""Ask your doctors for evidence based medical studies to prove what they tell you. Or look for them yourself. As far as side effects go, often a drug manual will list both weight gain and weight loss, insomnia and sedation, etc. as side effects for a particular drug. I use a drug hand book that lays out the side effects in terms of the percentage of people who actually get them whenever possible. I find this more helpful. But, the best thing is how my own body responds to them. I keep a journal when I start a drug, and keep track of the relief and possible side effects I get for a month or so, then I decide what to do with that drug, either stay on it, change the dose or stop it. Then I go discuss this with my doctor. After I get her opinion, I decide what to do. I only start one drug at a time so I have a better idea of what is the problem. Take care, Annette""Hi, Linda Tramadol or Ultram IS listed as an opioid in my drug handbook. Please read about addiction, dependence, and tolerance, not just opioids cause these effects. They are very different. Dependence and addiction are not the same thing. Take care, Annette""Are you truly addicted to them, or just become dependent on them? Addiction happens rarely to folks who use opiates for pain. Addiction includes the compulsive use of drugs to get high as opposed to managing your pain. Tolerance is also a normal side effect of opiates, so over time you may need more to get the same effect. If you find they just do not work well for you, try other things. The Botox injections do seem to gain in effect the longer you use them, what else does your doctor suggest? I did not find Lyrica to be useful, but did find gabapentin to be very good for my pain, especially nerve pain. I have slowly but steadily lost weight while I have been on the gabapentin, over 50 pounds. Take care, Annette""To me, all three doctors were in their own way warning you away from this treatment. You have to remember that a doctor may have 300-500 patients at any one time, if the GP has had a few who had positive experiences with this the odds are pretty bad... The psychologist was pretty darn clear about his feelings, and the pain management specialist less clear. We all have ways of understanding what a doctor says, you know these guys better than we do. I would do a lot of searching on the internet for medical sites that have evidence based studies and see what they say. I use Medscape a lot for medical research. I would look for larger, newer studies that compared the ketamine to control patients who got placebos. Look for exact percentages of how many people got how much relief. Look for the definitions of relief. In some studies if half the people in the study got 50% of their pain relieved, they consider that a success. Would you consider a procedure successful if it relieved half of your pain? And for how long? Make sure you really understand the wording. Keep in mind that often drug companies pay for the studies and carefully word them to draw you in. After you do all this research, decide for yourself and don<APO>t look back. It is not an emergency, you do not have to do this tomorrow. Take care, Annette I think ""real pain"" is like ""legitimate rape"". What useful information would you get from having this procedure done?""I also use Lidoderm patches sometimes. I find they work very well, even for the 12 hours the patch is off, I still get some pain relief. You can cut them up into pieces and put them where ever it hurts. The problem I have to complain about is the cost of these type of patches. Perhaps they are available in generic form now? Take care, Annette""I take gabapentin also, and find it helps a lot. I have also missed a dose now and again, without any withdrawal symptoms. Toradol can only be prescribed by mouth for 4-5 days due to possible adverse effects. At least that is what I have read. Take care, Annette""I give up, what does your doctor mean by ""how long is a piece of string""? Try asking for Tridural, I think that is the Australian version of Ultram/tramadol, but I am not positive. Tramadol is the generic form of Ultram here in the US. Generics here are much cheaper than brand name drugs. Take care, Annette""Thank you for your military service, especially losing a leg and trying to get decent VA care. The VA can be really good or really poor, depending on where you live. Here in Oregon, there is just one inpatient VA facility for the entire state. It has a great reputation though. My son lives in southern California, he says he gets decent care, but has to wait for it. We lived in Reno when he was growing up and the VA hospital there had a terrible reputation among nurses. He is a former active duty Marine. He served three deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq. I am so proud of him. Take care, Annette""That happens a lot here. Which is why the regulars here post regardless, and hope someone learns from our posts. I am glad this has been useful for you, and hope it was also for LoisMary. Perhaps she doesn<APO>t come back because she has found what she wanted and moved on. Take care, Annette""Tell him it is a smart ass thing to say, and ask the question over and over again, until he gives you a straight answer... Right after you tell him that a piece of string has two ENDS. Or do not even play his game by giving him that answer.... Look up piriformis syndrome about your pain in the buttocks. I have not had it, but read about this some time ago. Is Aussie Rules Football anything like rugby? I avoid watching sports other than soccer, my son is a rugby fan, but watches everything on TV. Take care, Annette""That is great that the PT found something for you to do that works. Be sure and follow through with the exercises, keep them up and maybe the pain will go away completely. Take care, Annette""American football started out like rugby, then it changed over the years. I never saw a football game til I was in high school, my friend was in the marching band, so she had to go to games. I went with her that once. I grew up on soccer, before it got popular in the US. My dad played until he aged out of the league he was in, but he was well into adulthood. He took me to watch Pele play in San Francisco a couple of times. They played 45 minutes halves with 15 minutes for half time, back then. If you fouled out and the ref tossed you out, the team played with one fewer guys. My only complaint was they did not let girls play soccer at all. I got to bake cakes to raise money for the guys, and I played better than most of them. Boo, boo... Thanks for the video, it showed me what I needed to see. Take care, Annette""My husband has stopped taking methadone twice since we have been together, and he has no withdrawal symptoms at all. He was having hip pain and tried the methadone then he had surgery to replace the hip. Problem solved. I have cut my methadone in half and had no withdrawal symptoms at all. I have been on daily opioids for about fifteen years now, I only take 30 mgs. of methadone a day. I do not deny that many people have withdrawals when they stop taking opioids. I may also someday. But, I don<APO>t think they are as bad as many people make out. I worked in a methadone treatment facility with real opiate addicts when I first got out of nursing school. I think they happen mostly because we all expect them to. An older couple I knew who were life long heroin addicts told me that withdrawals were like the flu and lasted about three or four days. It is a personal decision between a person and their doctor, what meds to use or not use. Take care, Annette""I think you are wrong about addiction, everything I have read says addiction includes using opioids in a compulsive fashion for the wrong reason, to get high rather than for the pain. Tolerance is a normal side effect of opioids, as is dependence. I have used opioids daily for about 15 years and never had any problem with them at all. I have gone up and down on the dose as needed. My husband has used them off an on for chronic pain and has never even gone through any kind of withdrawal syndrome when he stops using them, even after several years of use. Strange, I know, but I have lived through it twice with him in 20 years, no withdrawal at all. He told me the same thing happened, nothing, when he stopped using daily opiates after his cancer treatments, before I knew him. If they don<APO>t work for you, I would not bother taking them. Try other things instead. ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns, MD has been very useful to me, as has been ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"" by Dr. Margaret Caudill, MD, PhD. Both are great books written in a very useful way. You can use their assessment tools or your own to keep track of how you are doing. Take care, Annette""Talk to your doctor about what you should do when things like that cramp happen. He may tell you to take an extra Oxycontin or he may tell you to take something else. Will you run out early? Don<APO>t waste time and energy feeling guilty about taking RX meds, deal with your doctor and just be honest with him. I would not even discuss it with others. Take care, Annette""Whatever worked for you, Grace. That is what is best for you. I am so glad you are here, Grace, I really appreciate your posts. You are such a kind and generous person. Take care, Annette""Ouch!!!! I am so sorry to hear about your fall. I have not been on-line for several days at all. Although I have had trouble with balance lately, no falls at all, thank goodness. I have two small dogs, one knows how to stay out from underfoot, the other ones keeps us on our toes, lol. Take care, Annette""Well said. Take care, Annette""Who knows, not me. I wish I had great answers for you. But the University of Washington has a great reputation, and having your tests seen there is a huge plus. Can you get in to see a neurologist there? Even as a consult, it would be good to have a new set of eyes. I saw a neurologist once at UC-SF Medical Center, I lived in Reno at the time. He was great, he went over all my films, etc. did a physical exam and wrote a report for my family doc back in Reno. He didn<APO>t find anything new, but it was very reassuring to have my diagnosis verified, and my treatment plan considered as being a good one. Thank you, Grace, for pointing out this post. Take care, Annette""See your pcp and tell him/her what you have told us. If you fear the radiation of a mammogram, ask about trying an ultrasound examination instead. I have heard of using MRIs for breast exams also, no radiation at all there either. If your choice is a bit more radiation with a mammogram, or dying of untreated breast cancer, I would go for a bit more radiation. But, you need to decide for yourself. You do have other options. Also, do not jump straight to a cancer diagnosis, you may have something else entirely. Take care, Annette""I would suggest you see a doctor for a real diagnosis if you think FMS is possible. My pcp diagnosed me, and got a consult with a rheumatologist to confirm it. Take care, Annette""Do a search on your favorite search engine for free/low cost clinics in your area. See a doctor about your knee pain, and about a realistic exercise regimen. Most of your exercises sound pretty high impact to me. It seems like it might be better to start out with less intensity and work your way up slowly, especially since you are normally not very active. You did not mention your age...? You only have the two knees and you really need to keep both of them healthy. Take care, Annette""Most of the people who post here have some kind of chronic pain. We have all tried different meds, some work for some of us and some work for others. You won<APO>t know until you try them what will work for you. What is causing your pain may affect what meds will work best for you. Some people require steroids to break the pain cycle, if they have an inflammatory type illness, others use anti-seizure meds or antidepressants to mediate the neurotransmitters that carry the pain signals to the brain. Many of us also use opiate pain meds, and sleep aids. Being patient is tough when you hurt all the time, but have faith that the doctors will figure out what treatments will help you. It isn<APO>t all drugs, a lot of it is work that you have to do yourself. Take care, Annette""Hi, Swank The problem is many people do not have $100 or more just laying around to pay for an extra, unexpected doctor<APO>s appt. With the ER, you have the possibility of indigent care paying for the visit, or at the very least you can work out a payment plan with the business office. At most doctor<APO>s offices, you pay up front for care, they do not bill you later. The ER will often do CTs, MRIs, lab work, etc., all on their dime. The patient pays later, maybe. That said many people give fake names or addresses or have no intention of ever paying their medical bills. When you hurt bad enough, you will do most anything hoping to get rid of the pain, even if it is only for a few hours. Take care, Annette""I totally understand your peeve about this topic. I don<APO>t know how long this person has been going to the ER on the tax payer<APO>s dime. I hated it when the ER docs gave samples or antibiotics to parents who claimed they had no money for their kid<APO>s ear infections, but both had cigarettes on them. I do know that I don<APO>t smoke or drink or use drugs other than my prescribed ones, but if I did not have Medicare or private insurance, I would have a hard time being seen by any doctor other than a free clinic (no opiates are given by free clinics in my area) or the ER. I live fairly close to the bone financially. Medical access is hard in the US, we have great medical care if you can afford it. If you can<APO>t afford it, oh well.... Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know anything other than what you have posted here. I did not accuse you of not paying your bills. Perhaps this post was meant for someone else, or maybe you misunderstood what I said. Take care, Annette""In one post you say they are NOT migraines, and migraine meds are inappropriate, and in this post you say your ""migraines are so bad that I vomit..."" Please do not bother with the ER, see a neurologist who can follow you every day and have a plan for what you should do if you have head pain. That way you avoid the ER. Take care, Annette""I use neurontin also. It does not work like an opioid pain med to get rid of pain. I notice more if I forget a dose, then my pain levels increase. I went up to 1800 mg. once a day, then after a few months backed down to 800 mg. a day, I am still at that point. Keep looking for a diagnosis, but get on with your life too. I really recommend volunteer work, I do it also. It also increases my pain levels later on, but it is a really positive thing and very distracting. Take care, Annette""Many communities have phone numbers to call to find out what volunteer opportunities are available. Or call or drop by your local library, animal shelter, free clinic, food bank, etc. I have done all four of those. Currently I am volunteering at the animal shelter once a week for a couple of hours. There are one time things to do, and regularly scheduled things to try. You can even do stuff on the phone if you can<APO>t get out of your house. If you like working with kids, check at your local schools. They often need tutors or readers. If you have job experience in a particular area, you know where to go. I am a retired nurse, and volunteered at a local free clinic for nearly nine years. Let me know what you decide to try. Take care, Annette""Why would you think that another surgery would be useful? Most studies show that surgery is not the way to deal with pain, only with decreased function. I have never had an epidural, so I don<APO>t know if that would help either. I would suggest you do your own research before having anything done for a spinal problem. Take care, Annette""I might suggest you talk to an occupational therapist. She might give you better ways to do housework. For instance, I have heard of many people who keep a bar stool on wheels in their kitchens to do chores that most of us do standing. I have read that for many people doing nothing was the same as having surgery after a year or two. Same symptoms, same everything... I have a herniated disc in my neck, I had one fixed when I could no longer use my fingers correctly. This one the doctor said to leave alone, and I did. That was over ten years ago. I still get numbness in my hands at times, but it is managable. Things to think about... Take care, Annette""If you are worried about falling, see a physical therapist and learn to use a cane properly. You do need to give up working around the house until it is all done. Give yourself a set time, set it on a kitchen timer is necessary, and do only as much as you can do in that time. Then have a 30 minute rest period. 30/30 works well for me most of the time. 30 minutes working and 30 minutes resting. You should do what works for you. My numbness is in my hands from keeping my neck flexed for more than about 10 minutes, I have to be careful reading, and can really no longer find a way to do hand quilting anymore. My bad discs are in my neck. There are other things to do though. Take care, Annette""Follow up with the doctor that did the stitches if you never had any pain or swelling in this hand before. If you have, then see your pcp. Let us know what the doctor says. It is not normal. Take care, Annette""A doctor is allowed to prescribe methadone for chronic pain, but not for addiction. For addiction, you must go to a methadone clinic specifically for addiction. Why do you think you are addicted? It sounds as though you are not sure? I use methadone for chronic pain and find it works well. You do need to be aware that it can cause T wave changes in your EKG, although that is rare. I do not live in southern Calif. You need to get names from others through a private email address, we are not allowed to post them here. I would get a free, throw-away email for online purposes, I would not use a personal email address that my friends and family use. Post the email address along with another request for best results. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""You may not be able to find a doctor who is willing to prescribe 200 mg. a day of methadone. I have been taking various opioids on a daily basis for about 15 years now, and I switched to methadone due to costs now that I am on Medicare. I do not want to hit that donut hole, lol. It works great, but I was concerned that I was taking too much at only 30 mg. a day. I take 10 mg. three times a day, and may use BT meds once or twice a day. When I heard about the T wave changes causing problems with some methadone patients, I went and read the studies, it seemed to hit at about 60 mg. a day, although it can happen at lower doses. I told my doctor about it, and asked her to fix me up with a yearly EKG. A pain management doctor I saw as a consultant pretty much poo-pooed my concern but agreed that a yearly EKG was okay with him. Ask the question under your own heading, and post an email address so folks in that area can contact you. We are not allowed to post doctors<APO> names, addresses, etc. here. Wish I could help, but I don<APO>t know that area at all. Take care, Annette""Methadone can lengthen the T wave part of the heart beat complex, so that when the next beat should happen, the start of it lands on the last T wave. Not a good thing, because the electrical part of the heart has not had time to completely re-polarize. Our heart beats are divided up into P-Q-R-S-T sections electrically. To folks who do it all the time, it is like reading a graph. But it is very hard to explain to a lay person. Most of the reading I have done says this is very rare, but more common with methadone doses above 60 mg. per day. Some other meds do the same thing, so it probably would not be wise to take them in addition to the methadone. The is something to be aware of, and talk to your pharmacist about. OTC meds also. I take about 30 mg. of methadone a day, and discussed it with a PM specialist that I saw as a consult before my surgery 20 months ago. He was completely unconcerned about it, he felt it is so rare as to be silly to worry about on my dosage. He did agree to a yearly EKG, but I got the impression that it was just so I wouldn<APO>t worry about it, lol. There are several of us on this board who use methadone for pain. Don<APO>t worry about being the only one, it is so cheap, I think the drug companies would rather we not know about it. Take care, Annette""We can get codeine here in the US. Don<APO>t know where you heard that, but I have found that different geographical areas have different favorites as far as drugs go. Take care, Annette""I live in Oregon and a fellow health care worker told me that codeine cough syrup is available here without a prescription, I have not seen it, she said you have to ask the pharmacist for it as it is kept behind the counter??? I have never done so. I really think that codeine is such a minor pain medicine that I just would not use it at this stage of my life. Even if I could get it over the counter. At what doses is it available in Canada or Britain over the counter? All doses, or smaller doses? Take care, Annette""Why are you taking two different muscle relaxers? Why were you unable to get your medical records when your old doctor died? Not a big deal, just curious. What state to you live in if you don<APO>t mind saying? Many states have different and stricter rules than others, or than the DEA does. How much opiate is prescribed and the number of pills being limited sounds more like a particular state<APO>s laws than the DEA. Most PM doctors do occasional pill counts, and have you resign pain contracts now and again. In my state of Oregon, how many pills of an opiate are prescribed is not covered under any law. The DEA and the FDA both have websites you can go to to read about them. Take care, Annette""Newer research is showing a bad interaction between opioids and benzos. I took a class for healthcare professionals at the college level a year or two ago and the instructor said that she thought soon doctors would stop prescribing opioids and benzos to the same patients. The diazepam you are taking is a benzo. All requests for medical records need to be in writing, and signed by the patient requesting them. This is due to the HIPAA laws now in place. Phone calls don<APO>t work. It helps if you put your birth date on the request also. They should have told you all that in a letter when he died. I will check the DEA website also. I have not heard anything about this. Did the new drug contract have anything in it that you specifically object to? I don<APO>t blame you for feeling nervous, I would talk to the doctor, be as direct as you can. See what he says. Take care, Annette""I just do not think of that as being a contract kind of question. although I would not have any trouble with answering that question. I think of a contract as being between me and the doctor and what we would both do in certain situations. I think of that as a question the doctor would ask you during the initial interview. I guess putting it in writing is good to show that he asked you the question. I always do just fine, lol. I hope the same for you. Take care, Annette""I had one insurance company that required pre-authorization for my ambien. My doc wrote them a letter and that was the end of it, they paid for it as usual. She had to send them a letter once a year. Then we changed back to our old insurance company. If you have lousy insurance, get the generic, zolpidem, try that. It is fairly cheap. I have used it for years. Take care, Annette""Tell your parents, and ask them to let you see your doctor if they feel it is important. We cannot diagnose you here. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t believe at least part of what you wrote, unfortunately that puts the whole post in question. No one ends up after ""one small adjustment"" in 14 years, on 30 mg. of oxycodone IR several times a day with 15 mg. more twice a day for ""breakthrough"" pain. You don<APO>t take ER meds of any kind per your post, so why would your doctor order it for you? Just filling the two RXs on different days of the month 10-14 days apart would not render your doctor<APO>s orders moot. Try again. Your post certainly was not clear to me. Take care, Annette""Hi, Grace Yes, I am an RN, currently licensed in Calif. but no longer working at all. I am also an active patient who does lots of research on her own health issues. I currently live in Oregon, outside of Portland. I do not work for WebMD, I only participate in this board as a community member. My posts are no better or worse than anyone elses. We all learn from each other here. I am not always right, and do not take the place of seeing your own doctor. It is good to have you here, I have appreciated your unique point of view. Take care, Annette""How many times a day are you taking the ativan? How much is a ""small dose""? How many times a day do you take the oxycodone IR? Parafon Forte is a very old drug, my drug handbook says it should only be taken 3-4 times a day. That is very different from every four hours around the clock, which comes to six times a day. It can also increase the central nervous system effects of other drugs that cause CNS depression (opiates and ativan). Some research suggests that benzos and opiates not be used together as the risk is to great. Maybe your doctor is aware of this and is simply afraid to increase either one. Have you talked to your doctor about needing increased pain control? How long have you been seeing your doctor? Have you ever given him a reason not to trust you? I also have FMS, DDD of the cervical spine, etc. Pain control is difficult and it is not always possible to make the pain go away. Good luck. Take care, Annette""You would have to check and see what the side effects of the MMR are, and when they are expected to happen. Do they happen immediately after the vaccine is given or six months later, or a year later? You are always able to refuse a vaccine as an adult. With the MMR they are usually concerned about your German Measles status if you work in the health care industry. I had a titer done about 29 years ago that showed I was immune to German Measles, I had had it as a child. I have never had the MMR vaccine. I had all those diseases as a child. I am pro vaccine generally speaking. My little brother, now 50, had encephalitis as a child following measles, it was scary to see him so sick. At your age, it is hard to say what caused your joint pain, or chest pains. I had both about 16 years ago, the chest pain went away without any diagnosis at all. I had an echo that showed some valve leakage, but it was minimal. The joint pain as hung on, I was diagnosed with FMS. Everything hurts at times, but it is mostly in my hips and lower legs, and upper arms. What does your doctor say? He has the luxury of being able to examine you and has the test results, we aren<APO>t able to see those things. The echo shows the size measurements of the heart, the valves and how they function, etc. The EKG part of the stress test shows how exercise or other kinds of stress change the electrical functioning of the heart, make it beat faster, etc. You have to take all of these things in conjunction with your physical examination to come up with a diagnosis. An EKG or an echo may show imperfections that do not cause any day to day problems. Talk to your doctor!!! Take care, Annette""I am sorry to say that you should indeed see your own doctor about this, but you can tell him to prescribe a cheap alternative to the expensive NSAID, I take over the counter ibuprofen when I need an NSAID. I think I get 500 tablets (200 mg. each) for $8.99 when it is on sale. I use the generic store brands rather than expensive name brands. Costochondritis can be a repetitive problem from what I have read. I would not bother with a refferal for a specialist for this kind of thing, unless your pcp<APO>s treatment does not work. Take care,Annette""As a retired RN (me, too) you should already be aware of good posture and body mechanics, etc. Of course, you should do that, muscle strengthening exercises are also a great idea. An older ER doc I used to work with said if more people USED their bodies for physical work, the world would be a better place. There would be far less musculoskeletal pain because our bodies would be in better shape. I tend to agree with him. Who you decide to see as far as MD, DO, RN, or DC is really up to you as it would be with any adult. We all have our own personal feelings about the differences between practitioners. Just do your own research and then decide what to do next. Take care, Annette""Sorry for the miscommunication, it was not a judgement at all. I knew a woman who injured her back bad enough to need surgery by sitting in her desk chair and picking up a pencil on the floor. She was in her late 20s, early 30s I think. The doctor told her it was just the wrong angle to bend at, not the weight of the pencil. Whatever.... I hope you feel better soon. Take care, Annette""I agree with Grace, go into the neurologist<APO>s office and tell him the Advil does not work, you need something else. If he suspects you are having migraines, there are non-narcotic meds that do work. I know, because I take some of them. Do not get up to leave, and do keep repeating yourself if necessary. Do your own research, and make suggestions to him. I use Medscape for medical research. Make sure you do use real medical sites, the doctors turn off their listening ears as soon as one brings up commercial sites and crazy treatment stuff. Do realize that narcotics are not generally used for migraines other than in injections in the ER setting, they can cause rebound headaches, not a good thing. So can NSAIDs if you take them more than three days per week. When I am having a lot of migraines I often rotate meds so I don<APO>t take anything that often. Whatever meds you are given, take them at the first sign of a headache, not when it gets really bad. The meds work far better that way. Take care, Annette""That sounds reasonable.It is following the usual diagnostic routine for neck pain. First an NSAID and PT, then later if one still has problems, a scan. Don<APO>t worry, just keep on with PT and whatever the doctor suggests. An MRI usually doesn<APO>t show much of value in neck pain or headache, I know, I have had plenty of them. I have actually had cervical spinal surgery, it did not help my headaches at all. Fortunately, I had the surgery for functional problems in my hands that I was having due to cervical disc problems, it did help that. I think having an MRI is fine if you are having functional problems, less sure if it is of much value in pain management. Maybe the doctor can weigh in on this??? Take care, Annette""I personally think that MRIs are vastly over ordered. The studies have all shown that they are not good indicators for the cause of pain. Function, perhaps, but not for pain alone. I had surgery for loss of function, not to correct pain. My neurosurgeon felt it was too risky to do surgery for pain relief alone. I do agree with him. We have not found a way to determine who is a good candidate for surgery in the healing or cure of pain relief. I think I already responded to your other post. Take care, Annette""Hi, fibroFran17 I have an over the door cervical traction device that works well with straightening my neck out for me. This has helped the pain in my neck a lot. I have already done the sleep alignment, etc. And my headaches are migraines for sure, not from neck positioning. Thanks for all the good suggestions though. Take care, Annette""You might also try the Migraine, Headache Board here at WedMD, I used to go there a lot and found lots of good suggestions there. I don<APO>t deal with any doctors over the phone, it is too easy for them to shut you down. Just my opinion. I make an appt. and go in and see them in person. Take care, Annette""Talk to the doctor who ordered the test that brought you this diagnosis, and see what he thinks. Not all small things require treatment, or even cause symptoms, which is probably why he wants you to have the MRI. To get more information. It may all be related or it may not be at all. You could have more than one health issue causing all these symptoms. Take care, Annette""They probably had a cancellation and you got that spot. I always ask a doctor<APO>s staff to put me on the cancellation list if it is a long wait to get an appt. I would get another opinion from a surgeon who is not connected to that group. I personally would not consider any kind of fusion unless I were losing function in my arms or legs. I would never have one for pain control alone. The odds are just not good, I have read there is a 50% chance of a 50% improvement in pain. Some people end up in worse pain than before the surgery. Be sure you ask the doctor what his success rate is, then ask him how he defines success. Make sure you are both talking about the same expectations. He may think a 50% improvement of your pain is a success, but you may feel that being pain free is a success. Ask him what his complication rate is, and what his infection rate is. He should be willing to be honest with you about these things. If he tells you his patients never get infections, run, don<APO>t walk, out of the office. You need to be certain he has already done at least 100 of the procedures you are going to have, and that he does the procedure you need to have at least several times a week. Practice makes perfect, lol. Take care, Annette""It is very hard to say whether you are an addict or not, I will leave that to someone who actually sees you in person. Since you state you are more afraid of withdrawal than pain, I will tell you that withdrawal is very individual. Not everyone goes through serious withdrawal from opioids and often the main symptoms only last a few days, like 3-4. If you know it will end maybe it will be easier to get through. My husband doesn<APO>t even go through withdrawal from daily opioid use. I have been with him twice and he told me he had done it one other time when he had cancer, no withdrawals at all. I have cut my methadone in half and had no withdrawal symptoms at all. I had less pain after a surgery and was able to decrease my pain meds for quite awhile. The good thing is that opioid withdrawal (when that is all you are dealing with) doesn<APO>t cause seizures. Why did you have the other gran mal seizure in the past, and how long ago was it? Benzos are famous for causing seizures during withdrawal. Take care, and be honest in the future. Annette""I looked up this disorder in my Merck Manual. It is also called Herpes Zoster Oticus. It is Shingles affecting the 8th cranial nerve. The book said it could be self limiting and symptoms might go away, or it could be life long. If it just started in January, but the blisters have cleared up, it is still a wait and see thing. The book says pain from PHN, hearing difficulties and facial paralysis are common symptoms.. Do you have anything other than pain at this point? Take care, Annette""I have found gabapentin works better for me than Lyrica or antidepressants for my chronic pain. My internist pcp manages my chronic pain, I guess using a pain clinic or not depends on where you live. Take care, Annette""RA can affect organs as well as joints. I would see another rheumie and get a second opinion about what to do. RA can be degenerative so you need to be very careful what you decide to do. Take care, Annette""Sorry, but I don<APO>t see this as a support group, I see it as a place to discuss topics, and exchange information. I don<APO>t think we all have to agree with each other all the time, or support behaviour that is not productive or positive. I don<APO>t see anything in the name of the group that even mentions meds, RX or not. What ""Program"" are you talking about? I really look at this place as a place to come and share or obtain information regarding diagnosis and treatment of pain. I try not to ever judge people, and I am sorry if that is what you perceived. I truly respect anyone who has jumped through the hoops that you have with your varied medical issues. Stick around and see what happens. There are a variety of posts here all the time, and they change from week to week. Take care, Annette""It may well be. They both affect serotonin levels in your body. Take care, Annette""I suspected that was the program you meant. It is not generally included here. It is nice that it came up in your search, but this place has nothing to do with 12 step programs. It is a chronic pain site. Of course, there is some overlap with addictions and use of meds for chronic pain, I personally think it is very important that those of us that use drugs for pain are also aware of addiction and be wary of it. Having worked with addicts in the past on a professional basis, perhaps I am even more scared of addiction than many others here. I have far more admiration for folks in recovery than I do other folks. It is a tough row to hoe. And to deal with chronic pain on top of that.... I, for one, am really glad you are a member of this community. Take care, Annette""Serotonin Syndrome is when the body gets too much serotonin in the blood. Taking multiple meds that inhibit the re-uptake of serotinin can lead to this. Taking an SSRI (serum serotonin re-uptake inhibitor) type antidepressant along with some other kind of drug that also affects serotonin levels is the most common. My family doctor explained it all to me, many years ago when he gave me the option of taking another drug after I was already on a SSRI. I took the second drug, did not get serotonin syndrome. All I remember was a high fever...sorry. Try putting it into a search engine for Medscape or some place medical. You will probably find a decent explanation. Take care, Annette""I have never had epidurals or any other kind of injection, so I cannot speak from personal experience. I would go and talk to the doctor that did the injections. Tell him exactly what is going on. I would also ask him for links to research on this topic that might support his views. Then do your own search and see what you find. I would do all of this before having any more injections. Do not worry about being a bother to anyone. Take care, Annette""Please accept my sincere condolences for your loss. My son served three deployments in war zones, one in Afghanistan during the invasion, and during the invasion of Iraq and once during the occupation of Iraq. He is not the same young man that left, but at least he came home. I cannot blame the VA or the other doctors that your SIL got his meds from for not monitoring his intake, how could they do it? If your state has a drug monitoring program, perhaps they could have used it, but my state only recently joined that program. Sadly, I can only give responsibility to your dear SIL, he took the drugs. I don<APO>t know how much pain he was in, physical or mental, I don<APO>t think anyone does. I do not blame him, because I didn<APO>t know him. I was very severely depressed at one time and considered suicide, but thank goodness I have a really big family, I could not find a day to do the deed that did not fall near someone<APO>s birthday or anniversary, etc. By the time one came around the suicidal feelings had stopped. Shame on him for doing it at all, but shame on him for doing it the day after her birthday, and letting her find him in their home. I have known many family members that were related to suicides and their grief is always horrible. Your daughter can join the folks doing the article or not, depending on how she feels. Please pass on to her my wishes for healing for her. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know if it was an accidental overdose or not, I don<APO>t think anyone really knows. He was taking A LOT of different drugs and getting them from multiple doctors according to the poster. You cannot expect to send people off to war and have them come home without any depression at all. On top of that he had terrible physical pain according to the poster from cardiothoracic surgery. Maybe it was accidental, maybe not. Who knows. Take care, Annette""What matters is that now you and your daughter are missing him. You both should do whatever you need to do to get past this and move on with your lives. If that means participating in the move to help vets with these kinds of problems, do that. Maybe the two of you could participate together??? If that would only bring the two of you more pain and a constant reminder of your loss, then don<APO>t do it. Take care, Annette""I have a pcp who has tested me once in nearly 15 years for opiate levels, the test was not covered by Medicare and cost nearly $400. She did it after about 10 years, when her practice tested everyone on opiates. She is now with a group practice who does urine tests, they only screen for the various drugs they do not tell the doctor how much is in the person<APO>s body. I have had one of those since she started working for this group. Very cheap. Most doctor<APO>s do the urine test for screening routinely, but are just looking for certain drugs. If one was positive for something the doctor was not prescribing, I suspect the patient would be looking for a new doctor. However, if one was testing positive for a drug that the doctor was prescribing, one could take more than the doctor was prescribing and get away with it. I have signed a contract with my pcp, and my husband has also signed a contract with his doctor, however, if we were dishonest people, it would not matter to us. Or if we felt our pain was not being treated properly, we could get additional meds elsewhere. This may have been what happened with this young man, no one really knows what was inside his head. I don<APO>t go to the VA for care, my son does for some things, and sees a private doctor for other things. In my experience as a nurse, different VA hospitals give different levels of care, depending on where they are located, this is not uncommon per my son. Some for Kaiser hospitals, it varies from one to another. Not to pick on the VA or anything. My son<APO>s father<APO>s family was rife with suicides, it does terrible things to the families, and friends of the direct victims, accidental or intentional. His mom, two brothers and a first cousin all died. Take care, Annette""For a while anyway, just treat the symptoms. When you are in a more positive place, look for a diagnosis again. Never give up. Take care, Annette""Hi, Charity It is not FMS alone, but it could be FMS along with something else maybe. FMS does not cause altered lab work, crippled fingers or visible swelling. I don<APO>t know what to tell you, if you have not been seen at a university teaching hospital, that might be of use. Meanwhile just keep treating the symptoms like you have been. Take care, Annette""Why would you see a doctor without knowing what type of doctor he was? Is he even licensed? Did the treatment help you? It sounds as if he might have been a Doctor of Oriental Medicine. I had one in Reno many years ago, who did acupuncture on me. Unfortunately, it did not work. My MD said it does help about half of patients with FMS (that is what I have) for several months, but then usually stops working. My insurance even paid for it. In Reno, they had to be licensed. Is this information new to you, or have other (Western) doctors told you similar things? About your leg muscles, tendons, etc.? Take care, Annette""I am sorry I really have never heard of anything like that. There is a certain amount of variety in how peoples<APO> bodies are put together, but basically they are similar. See what your pcp says about the whole thing. If it is helping your symptoms I would continue with the electrical acupuncture, I don<APO>t think it can hurt you or make you worse. Take care, Annette""Did you stop taking any other drugs at the same time you started the Nucynta? Maybe you are going through a withdrawal syndrome in addition to having a bad reaction from the new drug??? Take care, Annette""This seems to either work or not. It seems like folks either love it or hate it. I won<APO>t take it for other reasons, but it is nice to kind of have that decision made for me. Take care, Annette""It is a side effect of all opioids. For me, the itching went away after a few weeks. No alcohol at all while you are taking pain meds, please, please???? Take care, Annette""An MRI report is made by a doctor, a radiologist, who has never seen you and does not know what your symptoms are. I agree with your doctor that the radiologists are often over-zealous reading films, they don<APO>t want to be accused of missing anything so they err on the side of caution. I truly believe that you should have the films of the MRI read by the doctor who cares for you in addition to the radiologist<APO>s report. Your own doctor can compare the symptoms you have, with the physical exam, and the films and decide what is likely to be the cause of your problem. I would take the films to another hand specialist or a neurologist and ask for a second opinion. It is illegal for your nurse friend to get copies of your medical records on the side, she could be fired, and possibly lose her nursing license. Anyone can write to a hospital and request copies of their records. Just include your full name and birth date when you request them. Don<APO>t put your friend in that position. We all want to help our friends, but it is not worth being fired for something one can get legally. Take care, Annette""What exactly do you ask for or want? I do not understand why you cannot be seen by a doctor in a sliding scale clinic near your home, certainly your income would qualify you? This kind of problem is best taken care of by your own doctor not an ER. Take care, Annette""I get SSDI and my income is too high for Medicaid in my state. After two years you do qualify for Medicare, I get that. But you have to pay for part of it. I really like Medicare.""Voc Rehab is a great suggestion, they paid for glasses for me, and helped me find a job I could do. I also considered moving to where it is cheaper to live. There is lower unemployment in the Dakotas but they say you need to have a place to live before you get there. There are oil fields that are hiring, but the housing market has not caught up to them yet. People are living in their cars, or in other folks<APO> basements. Take care, Annette""I have a policy through AARP<APO>s magazine that covers what Medicare does, plus all the meds I take, and does not cost me anything. I had to check with them to make sure they included my current doctors, and a plastic surgeon I was seeing back then. They just take the $$ that I would have to pay for Medicare part B anyway from my SSDI. They also limit the amount that I would have to pay out of pocket to a bit under $5,000 for the year, they pick up the rest of it. They do cover mine, but they don<APO>t cover my husband<APO>s doctor so he opted to stick with Medicare and pay for a Part D drug policy. So far all of our doctors opted to take Medicare. I can no longer work, but life is good. Take care, Annette""What exactly is in the ""shots"" you get in your neck for your pain? If the injections aren<APO>t working, I would have stopped getting them long ago. How long do you think they help you for? How much relief do you get, 50%, 80% etc.? How often do you get these injections? I personally would not have any invasive procedures done, including surgery, or implanted pain control devices. Take care, Annette""But, how much is the total for the shots? Everyone thinks they only pay for their co-pays, but the reality is that everyone pays for everything. The insurance companies charge premiums, etc. that are paid either by employers or private citizens, or the taxpayers pay for Medicaid/Medicare. I really think we have to change our outlook on things to understand what the total cost is, whether we actually pay it ourselves or not. All you mentioned was your pain before, so I didn<APO>t understand the big picture. Take care, Annette""I have an over-the-door cervical traction device that really helped years ago. It wasn<APO>t expensive and I would use it for 30 minutes several times a day while reading or watching TV. It has a cervical collar with foam inside, and a rope that goes up and over a pulley to a bag that you put water in, per the doctor<APO>s instructions. It took the pressure off the disc. Take care, Annette""I take a Vit. D supplement, have never noticed any change in my pain though. Don<APO>t take too much, do as your doctor says. Your body can have TOO much Vit. D. and that is not good. Take care, Annette""I needed a RX from my doctor in the state I lived in back then for the traction device. Your doctor should know what is necessary in your state. The main things I do now for pain other than opioid meds, are my hot tub, stretching and exercise, gabapentin, zolpidem so I get decent sleep, and Lidoderm patches as necessary. I also take NSAIDs twice a day for arthritis pain that can trigger my FMS pain. Only my hot tub get rid of my FMS pain completely, but only while I am sitting in it. It helps with pain for about 30 minutes after I get out. It is really good to know it is there though. I believe in universal health care, but not Obama<APO>s way. I think the government should tax us and provide something like Medicare to everyone. The way they do in Norway. I just think the more we are all aware of the cost of our health care the better we all could be at controlling it. Nothing is ""free"". When I posted it was more for everyone to think about, it was not aimed at you personally. Take care, Annette""MRIs are really good at showing us structurally what is going on. What they do not say is why we have pain. A study done some time ago showed that some people have great MRIs and have lots of back pain, and others have terrible MRIs and no back pain at all. This study was one that had well over 700 participants and was quoted in multiple articles in professional magazines. I saw it quoted in a nursing magazine for RNs, and on Medscape for Internal Medicine Doctors, and in ""Arthritis Today"", a publication by the Arthritis Foundation. When the doctors in research come up with a test that shows why and where we have pain it will be VERY useful. This is why many people you discuss surgery with may have varying opinions about it. Even respected doctors may have different opinions about doing back surgery on the same patient. Take care, Annette""Charles uses biofeedback sometimes, he says he can reduce his pain by about 20%. You might talk to him about this. Take care, Annette""Well put. Take care, Annette""I have had one cervical disc surgery, back in 1992, that was for decreased function in my hands. My neurosurgeon said he would do surgery for function, but not for pain at that time. Too dangerous, he said. I would avoid any more invasive procedures, because now what I have is pain. The oral drugs work fairly well, and the outcomes for surgical procedures for pain including implants of various kinds are not good yet. They can<APO>t seem to figure out which patients they might help and which ones to just leave alone. It has been nearly 20 years since my surgery, and they still can<APO>t figure out which patients need which procedures with any kind of certainty. What is the cost of an injection into your neck? Is it worth one month of ""help"" with your pain? Only you can decide that one. Take care, Annette""There are other drugs to try for your pain, but you need to increase your exercise. With bad knees, I think swimming and a recumbent bicycle are both recommended. I bellydance with DVDs and my trusty TV set. I only do this at home, in the privacy of our den. NO ONE gets to see, lol. I do an hour a day and have for 2-3 years now I think. Find something you like and can stick with. I have lost 50-60 pounds over the years this way. I do not let pain be an excuse for me to not exercise. I write it down every day, along with my meds. It is part of my treatment plan. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t want to change what I eat much, so I exercise instead, lol. So far, anyway. I like ice cream sundaes, etc. Maybe someday I will do better. It is one of those things that one knows one should do. I would rather hurt a lot, and exercise, than alter my diet. Take care, Annette""I pretty much stick with evidence based medicine, and the FMS Clinic at OHSU in Portland, OR stays up on FMS research. You can find them at http://www.myalgia.com . The nurse practitioner there has written that there are no studies to support any dietary interventions for FMS. When a special diet has worked and the study has been replicated elsewhere with the same results, I will think about it. I always ask for links to studies or the studies themselves when a doctor suggests something. I am sorry that the diet caused you so much pain. Take care, Annette""I am so sorry, I just butted in to someone else<APO>s conversation. Yes, I do have FMS also. Do not feel bad about hearing something and posting it to pas it on to someone who needs it. That is how we find out things. I had heard about the diet thing before and the nurse practitioner who used to work for WebMD on the FMS Board had posted that there were no studies that showed any diet helped FMS symptoms. She also works at OHSU<APO>s FMS Clinic. ALWAYS pass on information that you hear about. Others can comment on it, and a useful discussion may ensue. We all have free will and can use anything we hear about. Take care, Annette""I had breast reduction surgery about 20 months ago, it really helped me a lot. No more shoulder, neck/back pain. I never wore a bra at home because it hurt too much. I gave up the large shoulder bags years ago, no one believes how small a purse I carry now. Now I wear a bra, but it is either like the Ahh-Bra on TV, or a light bra with lingerie straps. You could also try a camisole if you are small enough. See a neurologist first, see what he says. Take care, Annette""Have you tried Lidoderm patches? They work fairly well for my hip pain due to FMS. If the percocet/oxycodone doesn<APO>t work, don<APO>t take it. Take care, Annette""How old is she? At what level does she dance? Does she still want to dance? What can she do before triggering pain at this point? Do the xrays and MRIs show anything at all? What may not show on these films and still be damaged? Take care, Annette""Thanks for responding. Now I have a better idea where the pain is. A member here swears by podiatrists, I have not been to one myself. I hope the new one figures things out soon. Take care, Annette""I had a swollen knee a couple of times and the orthopedist I saw told me that even if the MRI was negative, there was one ligament that it would not show anyway, an exploratory surgery would be needed to see that ligament. Have the doctors said anything about a structure in the ankle that is like that? Could she have anything wrong that just happened at the same time as the injury, but the pain might be totally unrelated? I would suggest she see another orthopedic doctor and go in without telling him about the injury, just tell him about the pain at first anyway. She might let him know that she dances, see if he comes up with anything else. Please let us know what happens. Take care, Annette""We actually know very little about pain. There is no test that will show just pain, or how much or how little one is having. Only the patient knows what their pain level is. Never stop believing your daughter! Can you put her on your health insurance policy? Or is that the one you are talking about? Plantar fasciitis can cause foot pain that is not due to an injury. I thought of it yesterday, but did not go on the computer at all. Is her pain in her ankle now or her foot? I think podiatrists do ankles too, or do they just do feet? I think I am confused about where her pain is because you mentioned it in your post to me three days ago. You said ""It hurts MORE to sit down with her foot than be on it."" Help??? Take care, Annette""I disagree, I have had bad experiences with sharing email addresses with folks I meet here. I no longer do it at all. If you can<APO>t post it here, I probably won<APO>t hear about it. As long as it is limited to just a few people who communicate this way, I don<APO>t really care. They should also post directly to a name, so I don<APO>t bother to read it. If it got to a lot of people and a lot of posts, then I would tend to agree with you. Eventually, they should probably trust each other enough to exchange emails. Just my opinion, we are all entitled to one. Take care, Annette""Whether those elevations are even important depends on how high they are. What does your doctor say about them? Take care, Annette""So they do think it is an autoimmune problem. Take care, Annette""Have you seen a rheumatologist? They deal with RA and some other auto-immune type illnesses. One might put new eyes on the problem. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t think you should ask for any meds by name. I think you should ask for control over your pain and improved function. Try what the doctor suggests, tell him what you may have already tried that worked or did not work. Write these things down and also write down any side effects you may have had and what you did about them. Doctors do go from Norco, a short acting opiate to a long acting opiate like Oxycontin or morphine ER or one of the others available. Take your drug formulary from your insurance company that covers your meds, and ask him to pick from the ones listed. In my experience which one you take really doesn<APO>t matter. There are no decent studies that show any one long acting opioid is different from another as far as efficacy or side effects. Try what he suggests and adjust things accordingly. You should be prepared to go off of Soma. Many doctors do not use it anymore for many reasons. Just be prepared, if it even comes up. It may not. Take care, Annette""He should talk to his doctor again, preferably with you present. Ask exactly what his low platelet count was? A bit low, or very low? Is it something you really need to even worry about? Ask the doctor your questions and see what his answers are? He has far more information than we do. Usually, small-medium bruises are just due to banging around that we may not remember when the bruises show up. Big, ugly ones are something altogether different. Take care, Annette""I hope this increase in Butrans helps control your pain, please let your doctor know in a week or so if it does or does not, so the two of you can discuss what to do next. You don<APO>t deserve to be in pain 24/7. When was your last increase of the Butrans? How often are you changing the patches? Take care, Annette""Try to establish a relationship with a doctor who ""will prescribe methadone"" for pain, even if they don<APO>t ""like to"". After a relationship has been established, then ask again for methadone. Trust needs to go both ways. After you have made a relationship happen, if the doctor still won<APO>t prescribe methadone, ask him why, and what he would suggest you do? I know it costs lots of $$ but you need to make friends with the doctor first. You are so lucky to be able to get your methadone from your old doctor meanwhile, keep him. But, you might ask him if you can come every three months now that driving is a problem. He can give you written RXs with the current date on them, but write ""fill on<UD><UD>"" with the date he wants you to fill them. That should cover his butt. If you have not had any problems in the years you have seen him, he shouldn<APO>t have a problem doing this during your transition time. Don<APO>t lose him anyhow. Take care, Annette""I have found no real randomized, double blind studies that show one opioid type med is more efficacious or has fewer side effects than another. They also have similar addiction potentials, if that is concerning. There are few good studies that compare them head to head. Some medical studies have shown that methadone is better for nerve pain than the other types of opioids. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""My doctor gave me a consent form to sign regarding opiates so that I would know what I am getting into. It did warn about dependency, etc. I signed it, so I figure it is on me. That said, I worked with opiate addicts early in my nursing career, and the older ones told me that detoxing off of opiates is no worse than the flu, deep, bone pain, etc. and lasts about a week. My husband was on methadone and oxycodone twice for chronic pain in the twenty odd years we have been together and he has gone off of all meds twice in that time, no withdrawals at all. I have not stopped taking opioids in the 15 years I have been on them daily, but I have cut my dose in half after a surgery decreased my pain levels, and had no withdrawals at all. I think it varies from person to person, and depends a lot on our expectations. I do not believe that detoxing is a ""suicide mission"", I think it is probably unpleasant to fairly bad, but only lasts a week or so. We are talking about opioid withdrawal in fairly normal adults. Coming off of benzos is something entirely different, as is coming off of a mix of drugs. Take care, Annette""If you are only taking 1 mg.a day of Suboxone (buprenorphene content) I would suggest discussing the taper with your pcp or the pharmacist where you fill your prescriptions. That is a very low dose, if you went to every other day, and then stopped taking them altogether, that would make sense to me. I would stop worrying about the ""horrors of detoxing"" that you read on the internet. If you are on good terms with your pcp I do not understand why he would not be willing to advise you on this? Take care, Annette""Thanks so much, Ray216. I do really appreciate your comments. Take care, Annette""What do her doctors say? I assume she has had the stitches out already? Did they do xrays? When? Has anyone mentioned RSD? Has she seen a neurologist? Take care, Annette""I would keep a pain journal a couple of times a day, score your pain on a scale of 0-10, 10 being the worse pain ever, and 0 being no pain at all. Also write down any meds you take, and activities that you do, like walking, that make the pain better or worse. Ice or heat or whatever else you might try should also go on this journal with the results noted. The pain scale is used by the doctor for trends, so don<APO>t worry about it, use it as you think about it. See a doctor as soon as you can get a ride. But, I would not think of chronic pain lasting several weeks as emergent with no other symptoms. That is just me though, it may be different for you. If you should not be able to walk at all, or if you have bowel or bladder incontinence consider that an emergency, and definitely call an ambulance as needed. Keep your cell phone in your pocket or at your bedside, just in case. Take care, Annette""First thing, don<APO>t panic!!! My husband had AVN to where his doctors, both his pcp and the orthopedic surgeon he sent us to, both said he should not even be able to walk anymore. He walked with a cane at that time. He was working as a large truck (semi trucks) mechanic at the time, and continued to do so for a year or two after the replacement surgery (without the cane). I saw the xrays the pcp did at his office, the head of the femur (the large bone in the thigh) was completely collapsed. The doctors were right. However, my husband also had a non-healing wound on his opposite leg and could not have the hip replacement surgery for two years for fear of getting an infection in the hip. First thing, you do not have to continue to see the orthopedic doctor that you saw the first time. I had done research on orthopedic doctors when my nephew needed surgery on his hip a few years before. We dug out the research I had done, my husband picked out a couple of surgeons and saw them both. Then he picked one to do the surgery with when the time came. In my experience the doctors could not tell for certain why my husband had AVN, like you he drank beer socially, he had had chemo 25 years ago, but could not remember what he had had, and he fell on the hip on pavement from the height of a large truck<APO>s door just before it started hurting. It can be caused by drinking alcohol, taking steroids (like in chemo or other medical reasons), or by trauma to the neck of the femur. Does it really matter why you need surgery? If you drink too much, you have probably knew that already. If you do, do something about it. If not, don<APO>t worry about it. How many stages of AVN do you know about, that you are on stage 3? This is something we skipped altogether. This is why many of us here feel it is wise to get diagnosed by a MD, then see a chiropractor afterwards if you wish to. With all the care you have had, it might have been better had you been diagnosed sooner. Or it might have made no difference at all. Take care, Annette PS, Enjoy your vacation!!!!""A DO is fine as far as I am concerned. I have worked with several and feel very good about them. Although this one doesn<APO>t sound that great as far as his bedside manner went. Keep making appointments with different specialists until you find one you are comfortable with. Most important, enjoy your trip!!! Take care, Annette""It sounds like your pcp is following the usual medical procedures. I would wait and do what he suggests for longer than 2 days, before doing other things. Did he suggest bedrest, not recommended. Or just rest as far as strenuous activity is concerned, but to continue the usual stuff? That is recommended. Take care, Annette""An orthopedic surgeon I saw once about a swollen, sore knee told me that there was one ligament out of three that caused pain in the knee that would not show up on MRIs or xrays. Only an exploratory surgery would tell us if this ligament was the problem. Has any doctor suggested exploratory surgery to you? Don<APO>t go by what you have read, see an experienced doctor for a diagnosis. Take care, Annette""Hi, Grace We are both doing fine. Thanks for asking. I also expect to be on pain meds for the rest of my life (unless someone discovers something truly amazing). I am on Methadone 30 mg. a day in three divided doses of 10 mg. each. The pain management doctor that I saw as a consultant kind of poo-pooed my concern about QT changes. He felt that it simply would not happen to anyone taking a dose of 60 mg. a day or less. He did agree to my request for an EKG yearly if I wanted one. A dose higher than 60 mg./day might worry him a bit more. I am aware of this, but not really concerned about it at this point. Take care, Annette""I read a post recently and did some research on Butrans as I had never used it myself. The poster said they were using 20 mcg/hr patches, but two patches at a time. This seemed like a lot at the time, but like I said I didn<APO>t know that much about it. I read about it on RxList.com they said that 20 mcg/hr was the maximum one should use. I read more, and they said that studies have shown that 40 mcg/hr increases the QT segment of ones EKG. This is similar to methadone, which I do take. I thought I should post just to share information. Take care, Annette""Opiods cause itching as a side effect in many people. It often goes away after a few weeks. Hives itch, but you also get a red rash with hives, that you don<APO>t get when itching is just a side effect of the meds. Let your doctor know right away, and once he examines you he will be able to tell what the problem is. Take care, Anentte""Glad to help. I had itching off and on for about three months after I began taking opiates daily, but it did go away. Let your doctor know anyway, even without the rash. He may be able to advise you of a medication to take for the itching until it goes away. Take care, Annette""I just blame it on getting older, lol. The reason antidepressants help some folks with chronic pain is that the main neurotransmitter that they mediate also helps control pain signals (in addition to mood modulators). It really has nothing to do with the doctor thinking you are depressed. I get rather severe side effects with all different kinds of antidepressants, memory loss, etc. I don<APO>t try any of them anymore. Everyone reacts differently to drugs. Take care, Annette""I had the same kind of problems with antidepressants back when I took them, many years ago. As far as the dog goes, my husband and I mark it off on a chart when we give the dog his meds, and feed him. It isn<APO>t that hard, and it is much easier than worrying about it. Take care, Annette""Does the same doctor prescribe both the Cymbalta and the Paxil? It is unusual to be on two of them. If it is safe for you to be driving, get another car as soon as you are able. It sounds like it would be hell to be that dependent on others if there are alternatives. Take care, Annette""These are great exercises, but you must continue to do them forever to maintain any positive effects. I think that is worth it if you are suffering and they fix it. Don<APO>t need drugs or surgery. Take care, Annette""I tried it years ago and it did not help my pain at all. We are all different. Also be aware that even though some states, mine included, condone the use of marijuana for certain medical conditions, the federal law is against marijuana. The feds have moved into Oregon and made some major busts, be aware and be careful. Take care, Annette""You should be very glad that he gave you another chance. I am glad that everything worked out well for you. That said, a urine screening test a month after you mistakenly took your husband<APO>s pill would not show positive. It is my understanding that the tests only show up positive for a few days after one takes the pill. It seems like perhaps you learned your lesson, and are being very careful with your meds now. Take care, Annette""What had you tried already? What else do you do as far as exercise, massage, etc.? How much and how often do you drink the Nopalea? Take care, Annette""I have to agree with Pesky on the doctor thing. I worked in hospitals and I have been a pain patient now for well over 15 years. In all that time I met perhaps one doctor in an ER setting who treated me in a questionable manner. Everyone else has been wonderful, they don<APO>t assume I am a drug addict at all. They do urine tests, and get informed consent, and do contracts, etc., to protect themselves and us. They worked a long time to get licensed and all, I really respect that. Take care, Annette""I am sorry, but I disagree with you about a pill showing up in your urine test a month after taking one pill in error. Only you know if you took it on purpose. Perhaps, because I have been a nurse for so long, I know how important it is to read labels every time you open a pill bottle. Now, we both know. Take care, Annette""""We all have our opinion and are allowed to disagree."" Take care, Annette""I had a dog like that once, he was on anything as soon as it hit the floor. Since then the first thing I have done with all animals is teach them the ""Leave it"" command. At least it gives my a few more seconds to retrieve dropped stuff. Ambien comes in many different pills now that it is generic. The ones I currently get are purple and round, unlike all other pills I take. I do recall them being almost identical to another pill I was taking. It certainly made life harder for me. I keep my nightly dose on my nightstand. Take care, Annette""How did your sister have your pain control meds reduced by 1/3? Doesn<APO>t your doctor write the orders on your hospital order sheet? Was this done in the hospital during surgery for the by pass? That is what I got from your post, but I could be wrong. Take care, Annette""Compartment syndrome is an acute emergency requiring immediate surgery in an effort to save as much tissue as is possible. I cannot imagine the frustration and anxiety you must feel going from feeling fine to your present state. YOU WILL GET BETTER!!!!! It is early days as of right now. Ask, or insist on, adequate pain relief as soon as possible. This might keep you from ending up with chronic pain. Even if you do, that is not the end of the world. Many of us have chronic pain, we get along okay. No one knows what the rest of our lives will be like. Take care, Annette""I checked the third option as a joke but changed it to something sensible. If you can live with it, for the length of time it takes to go to med school and do your residency, it probably does not need fixing. If the doctor had xrays to look at, he probably saw fairly normal hands/wrists if he sent you on your way. The is one small bone in your wrist that often ends up broken from the type of fall you described, but since the films were done a week after your fall the fracture should have shown up by then. It often does not show up if the films is done immediately after the fall. Your explanation of the injuries is a bit confusing. Which end of the first metacarpal has a joint that is/was painful in each hand/wrist? Each metacarpal has two joints, one at either end...You have 5 metacarpals in each hand, #1 being the thumb, #2 the index finger, etc. I hope by the time you read this, you are feeling better. Take care, Annette""The bone I was talking about where the fracture may not show up for a week post injury is the navicular/scaphoid bone. This small bone in the wrist has very little blood supply and heals poorly. It is often fractured when one puts out ones hand to protect one from a fall, and hyperextends the wrists. I can<APO>t find a book that has all the small bones of the wrist in it. I can however picture in my mind what you are talking about. All the injuries from what you described would be seen on xrays. If it continues to bother you, I would go see the same orthopedic surgeon as you saw before. Tell him it is still bothering you and see what he suggests you do. You should not be charged nearly as much as the first visit. If he tells you the same thing is wrong, maybe try what he suggests you do to see if it gets any better. If it has affected your life for three years it is certainly important enough to be seen by a doctor. You could also be seen by your pcp if you have one. Take care, Annette""If he works for the worker<APO>s comp people, I would ask a different doctor to check you out and give him the MRI scans, not the reports, but the actual scans. See what he says. A worker<APO>s comp doctor might be all above board, but he might also be diagnosing in such a way as to make it financially beneficial to the worker<APO>s comp people. It is normal for you to develop symptoms later in life for disc problems, so it might be a born with it thing, or you might have developed it anyhow as you aged. Accident or not. Or, it might be from the accident. I don<APO>t know I am not a doctor, and have not examined you. I would get a second opinion. Take care, Annette""Twice in my adult life I have developed a severely painful and swollen left knee with no known cause. Came on fairly quickly, had xrays, but no MRIs. Checked out by a rheumatologist, and an orthopedic doc in addition to my pcp. I took the watch and wait approach and after about 3 months it went away. It happened twice, five years apart. Xrays showed no change over the five years, only a slight amount of wear and tear for my age that showed up the same on both xrays. I am so glad I declined MRIs, surgery, injections into the knee joint, etc. I used oral ibuprofen (for three months) and prednisone (for 2 weeks). It has been well over 8 years since the last episode. I don<APO>t know why they did that, and don<APO>t really care at this point. I declined the MRI because I would not have consented to surgery anyway at that point in my life. I do not have expensive tests done if the results will not change the treatment plan. Had the pain continued for 6-8 months, perhaps I would have agreed to the MRI, not sure. I would suggest seeing a rheumatologist since it happened in both knees at the same time. Take care, but don<APO>t rush into anything. Annette""Yes, tolerance can develop over time, so that the patient no longer gets the same amount of relief from the same amount of the drug. Maybe if you go with her to the doctor and ask together what to do, it would be helpful. I would take a drug handbook, or a print out on Norco, with you that states this problem regarding tolerance. Tell him that you read about it, and it makes sense to you, because that is what you have seen happen to your mom. Pain is fairly common with strokes. You might do research on her other medical problems to make sure that the opioids do not contribute to them. Take care, Annette""It seems to me that I read somewhere that opioids are good antidepressants for certain people. Not a lot of people, but a small group of them. You might just be one of them??? Take care, Annette""Unfortunately, you have to decide for yourself. My doctor would be kind enough to continue it. Maybe there ARE better drugs for you to try for your depression... Take care, Annette""Are you really complaining because no one happened to respond to you in five hours???? This is a discussion board not a doctor<APO>s office. You should not take aleve and advil on the same day. You need to talk to your doctor in order to get relief. Tell him about how you have tried heat and ice and how you do it. Tell him how much of the over the counter medicine you have been taking, and how often. Be honest with him. You don<APO>t say exactly what kind of work you do, or how old you are. Seven days a week may not be possible any more, I don<APO>t really know. Take care, Annette""Did you follow through and go see your gynocologist like the ER doc told you to? Please do that first thing. I had strange and painful periods for about ten years before I finally went into menopause. My family doctor put me on various hormones after checking my blood levels. It made everything okay for me. I am in my 60s and still have all my female organs. Ignore your family, you and your doctor will know when it is time for a hysterectomy, if ever. Take care, Annette""I figured there was more to the having babies than what he said, that is just such a dumb thing for him to say. It isn<APO>t even necessarily true. My doctor told me that getting a hysterectomy would stop the bleeding problem, but not necessarily the other issues I was having, including migraines that happened along with my periods. He said one third of women got better, one third stayed the same, and one third got worse. He said I could also have my ovaries removed too, but then I would have to go through menopause now instead of later. He was willing to let me decide what I wanted to do. He was a good guy. He offered me hormone treatment and I took that instead, I don<APO>t know how well it worked, but it was better than what I was going through. I already had my son, so I didn<APO>t have that to worry about too. I am so sorry you are having so much trouble with all of this and can<APO>t get pregnant on top of it all. Take care, Annette""Anonymous<UD>247818 spelled it correctly, lol. Take care, Annette""I can only say to tell your family that discussing your health issues is something you have chosen to do only with your doctor. Tell them how much the phone calls upset you, and then HANG UP. Do not discuss this with them as long as it makes you cry. 2-3 hang ups and they will probably get the message. Let me know how your appt. goes. I am 62 now, and am really glad I opted to keep my uterus. My friends who had hysterectomies are not doing as well as I am. Take care, Annette""Other than having my tubes tied by an OB-GYN and seeing one for the delivery of my child, I never saw a GYN, only my Family Practice doctors. I prefer them myself, and during my reproductive years I made sure I saw one that delivered babies. They are hard to find nowadays. Getting pregnant for other reasons is more important than getting pregnant with the hope that bearing a child will stop or calm your pain. What an evil thing to do to a child!!! I hope I misunderstood you, I would see a different doctor myself. Take care, Annette""The relationships you have with your mom and your aunts should be based on honesty. Sit down and call them all and tell them that from now on your health issues including reproductive ones (if you wish) are between you and your doctor. You should warn them that you will hang up if they ask about these things, and then you have to do so. I think that simply avoiding talk to them might make you feel better in the short term, but eventually you will talk to them and the problem has never been discussed, so you end up in tears again. I am probably closer to your mom<APO>s age than your age, and trust me this is no way to live. However, do whatever is right for you. Taking my advice based on what I know about your situation may be silly. I have only heard what you have posted here. Take care, Annette""It all sounds good to me. Just interview PM doctors like you would any potential employee. Tell them what is wrong, and what your doctor has suggested so far. Be open to trying anything he suggests, but find out for sure how long it should be before you know if whatever he suggests is working. If he wants you to sign a contract, this is a normal thing, be sure you read it though, and ask him what to do if your pain gets out of control between visits. Some doctors like to deal with things on the computer or on the phone or in person (like my doctor). If he is like her, ask about how you get in to see him promptly, and what to do on weekends, etc. My doctor can always see me within 48 hours, often sooner, my husband<APO>s doctor can see him the same day if he calls promptly at 7 am. They both keep a couple of appts. a day open for emergencies. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t think most doctors are pressured by the FDA or the DEA. I just have not seen it myself. If you are getting any RXs for any kind of pain management from one doctor it is fair of him to ask you to sign a contract, you are free to refuse to sign it and risk losing that doctor. All that means is you would have to find another pain management doctor. Long before the individual states passed laws saying what they say now about pain management, all three states I have worked in myself had laws on the books saying it was illegal to get any kind of RX pain meds from more than one doctor, it was a felony. According to a parole/probation agent that I knew, they had that law so they could arrest people who had RX drug problems and saw more than one doctor. The present laws are mostly related to documenting that opiate treatment is helping the patient rather than harming him. I can live with that. Documentation, and taking a couple of hours of continuing education on pain when you renew your MD license is not a big deal to me. They have to take continuing education anyway, just like RNs do. Take care, Annette""No problem, I didn<APO>t mean to sound argumentative at all. I still get my meds from my pcp, she is great, and I think you and I generally agree on things. She too has been happy with recent changes in how doctors are expected to do things because it makes her life easier in the long run. She also did a very expensive urine test, and she arranged to write it off for me because Medicare would not pay for it. Our state does not require it, but her old practice did, the new practice does less expensive drug screens. I have been seeing her for nearly 15 years now. Take care, Annette""I would just talk to the PM doctor and either get his written permission to get your hydrocodone from your pcp or make a decision about which doctor you want. It seems like a little thing. but it may not be. Take care, Annette""I know, but I tend to be very direct and do not beat around the bush, some folks do take me the wrong way, especially at first. I enjoy reading your posts as well. Take care, Annette""Lyrica is not considered an opioid but it is a pain management drug, and I think what they are saying is either this doctor manages ALL your pain management meds, or you get them from someone else. In many states it is a felony to get controlled substances from one doctor and not tell all the other doctors you see about it. Maybe this is how this particular doctor keeps from getting himself in trouble with patients getting PM drugs from multiple doctors. Like I said in my other post, talk to him and see what he says. Take care, Annette""Pregablin (Lyrica) is in the controlled substance V section. The doctor can write for refills on it if one wishes to. I was on it for a brief time, it didn<APO>t work for me. My doctor wrote it with refills for six months at a time. Only the controlled substance II RXs cannot be refilled, but must have a new hard copy for each time you fill it. At least this is my understanding of the federal laws. Take care, Annette""No worries, they do that occasionally. I just move on, if my response comes up later on (it usually does), fine, if not, oh well... Take care, Annette""No, I went back and checked and I think you responded to all my posts to you. Take care, Annette""I wish they would warn folks about med limitations before they had weight loss surgery. I read all the time about people post op having problems with this. Have you discussed trying skin patches with meds in them to your doctor? You have more choices that way, I think there are anti-inflammatories now that come in skin patches, I am not sure what those would do for you. There are also Butrans, fentanyl, and Lidoderm skin patches. I would make an appt. and go in and see your PM doctor in person. Ask him face to face why he cut your RX in half? Explain what you have to go through post surgery as far as meds go. Maybe he just doesn<APO>t know about bariatric surgery. Tell him you would like to see someone else if he cannot help you. I would also suggest taking a close friend or family member to the appt. with you, with a pen and paper to write down his suggestions. He cannot call in percocet, you have to go to the office and pick up a written RX, you may as well see him in person. Congratulations for losing all that weight!!!! Take care, Annette""Hi, If the pain went away for 18 months after the bariatric surgery, and then started again, I would start with that date as the beginning of the pain. A few months is one thing, but 18 months is a long time to be relatively pain free. Don<APO>t bother with blaming anyone, that doesn<APO>t get you anywhere at all. Doctors make errors on RXs all the time, as do computers I have found. I read all my RXs before I leave the office exam room, so my doctor can rewrite any if necessary. I would not be confrontational with the doctor, just tell him the ""experiment"" did not work and you need to go back to your old dose. I think having your husband with you in the exam oom is a good idea. Unfortunately, it does seem that doctors are much more circumspect with their words when it does not come down to a matter of ""he said, she said"". I have not had bariatric surgery because it is only to help with weight loss, one still has to change ones habits about diet and exercise, also due to the fact that I am used to carrying around extra weight, and I am concerned with meds at my age. I guess there are actually lots of reasons I have not had it yet. Each to their own though. I am still proud of you for losing weight!!! Take care, Annette""I totally agree with you about the medications. I personally have decided not to even try any meds that have not been widely prescribed already for at least five years. Of course, this is for non-lethal problems, if I had AIDS or cancer, I might think differently. I don<APO>t think I can even count on both hands the number of meds that have been withdrawn from the market entirely since I became a RN 40 years ago. It is really scary. Thanks, Dr. A. Take care, Annette""Sorry, you may have to learn to live with this. Why do you think the discs cause your pain? When my chronic pain affected my sleep, I asked my doctor for a long acting med to help me get past this 4-5 hour of sleep thing. I only took it at night, it worked for me. Curling your legs up and stretching your lower back seems like it would help lengthen the shortened back muscles. What you are doing may help in the short term, but does it contribute to shortening the muscles over the long term? Talk to your PT about this, he would know more than me. Take care, Annette""I worry about the reality of how well something actually works if the insurance companies won<APO>t pay for it. That is a big, red flag. Medicare is usually the first to approve something, then the other insurance companies follow. I would do careful research on your own first to make sure it is a worthwhile treatment. I would ask your podiatrist for links to evidence based medical studies showing success. Does the brochure say you would have anyway of knowing if you did not see improvement in 6-8 months? Would you see at least partial improvement so you knew you were on the right track? Take care, Annette""From what I have read unless a treatment has been shown to cause problems the FDA will approve it, it doesn<APO>t mean it helps, it just means it doesn<APO>t harm you. Ask your doctor for references from patients he has performed it on, let them tell you how well it works. If he can<APO>t/won<APO>t give you any names, I wouldn<APO>t do it. Good luck to you. Take care, Annette""Ask the lab that does the test you are concerned about if using the spray will interfere with their test. That said, if you have been using the spray for 6-8 months and the PM clinic has only told you the last two months tests have been negative, it would not seem logical that the spray is interfering with the medication in the patch. However, I would get into following up on this as the PM doctors can fire you from their practice. If the spray were blocking the medication in the Butrans patch from even going into your body, would not your pain levels have been drastically higher during that time?? Withdrawal symptoms might have happened?? The PM doctors are not refusing to allow you to have blood tests, they just said to have your pcp order it if he wants it. He needs to get off of his butt and order it, there are diagnostic code books that tell the person ordering the test what code number to put on the paper work. It sounds like a run around to me. Take care, Annette""I would discuss the exercise thing with your doctor. It sounds to me like you are taking things a bit far. If you live somewhere like Las Vegas or Palm Springs and it is truly too hot to walk outdoors, I would suggest indoor mall walking. I used to live in Reno and one of the malls had a great group of people who had measured out how many laps it took to make a mile, etc. They gathered every morning when the mall opened and did their laps. Talk to your doctor and perhaps to a registered dietitian for advice on exercise and diet suggestions for weight loss. I know the fentanyl patches do not prevent daily walking. Take care, Annette""What did his doctor say? Take care, Annette""See your primary care doctor. You may have plantar fasciitis, does the pain ease up or go away after you have walked a bit? You may not have it also, but only your doctor can tell you after doing an exam and medical history. Take care, Annette""Go see your family doctor or a podiatrist (foot doctor). Odds are they will fix you up just fine. Take care, Annette""I always suggest folks see a neurologist for chronic pain. You don<APO>t mention your age, gender, pregnancies, etc. I am not sure how you can measure the separation of muscles, especially after surgery and repair with mesh. Maybe they don<APO>t investigate this as the source of your pain, because they do not believe it is??? What does your primary care doctor say? Take care, Annette""Yes, I think you should see your doctor for a good, thorough exam and history. Don<APO>t assume it is cardiac just because it is in your chest. It may be and it may not be, but only a doctor and an EKG might tell you. Take care, Annette""See your family MD first of all, if you haven<APO>t already, to be sure that these are the problems that are giving you back pain. I would also suggest Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and seeing an occupational therapist about how to set up your desk and home/yard for your chores so you don<APO>t give yourself unnecessary back pain. Take care, Annette""I have only taken this med once while I was in the hospital and it did nothing at all for me. As a nurse, I have given it to patients many times. My concern is that it seems to be very short acting, and the reading I have done seems to say that the shorter acting a med is, the more quickly a person seems to develop tolerance to it. Patients I have had did not use it as one of their regular meds for chronic pain, it was given to them in the hospital for acute pain. ALL the opiates can be addictive, but I don<APO>t believe that any one drug is more addictive than the others. The thing to always remember is that your pain meds are for physical pain, not emotional distress or to sleep, etc. As long as you take them according to the doctor<APO>s instructions, the research I have read says the rate of addiction is 5% or less. That is a low percentage for side effects, I would not worry about it if you have never been a substance abuser in the past. Which drug you decide to use is up to you and your doctor. I would take all the pros and cons, write them down and discuss them with your doctor. Take care, Annette""Just put the problem to your doctor and let him decide the best way to taper you off. I would not suggest you ask for specific drugs or doses. The doctor has tables and tools for drug conversion so he gets as close to the correct dose as possible. Then you adjust the dose as needed til you find the right one. I know you sound frustrated and anxious to change over, but the fentanyl will not kill you, you are already half way there. Fentanyl is many times more potent than the other opiates, so you really can<APO>t just switch over until you get the dose down to a certain level. It is up to your doctor to decide how fast to make these changes. If you would rather just go through withdrawals, that is an option, but not one I would choose. Naltrexone is not a drug to take while you have opiates in your body to help with the withdrawal symptoms. Naltrexone is an opiate antagonist and will start the withdrawal symptoms immediately if you take it while you still have opiates in your body. Clonidine is a drug that is commonly used to help with withdrawal from opiates. There are also other drugs you can take to deal with the individual symptoms. Good luck. Annette""Do you really believe that whatever surgery he wants to do will relieve your pain? I had one herniated disc removed, and one herniated disc left alone, a year or so later on the advice of the same surgeon. I found no difference in the relief of pain. Function was better after the first surgery, as the surgeon said it would be. My neurosurgeon said that getting pain relief had about a 50% chance of happening. He did not feel doing it for pain relief alone was a good idea. That was why he did not do surgery the second time, function was fine, it was the pain that was not fine. Ask the surgeon who will be doing your neck how he feels about neck ""cracking"" after surgery. He can see your spine on film and knows just what you mean by ""cracking"" your neck. Take care, Annette""Cracking your joints just releases small bubbles of gas in the joint fluid, and does not make any difference in arthritis when you are older from everything I have read medically. I think it is an old wives<APO> tale about getting arthritis in the joint later on. I still crack my knuckles and my neck (before and after surgery). I think it really depends on exactly what kind of surgery you have on your neck. There are many types of cervical surgery. Take care, Annette""Some studies give surgery a 50% chance of decreasing pain by half. Maybe if it was a 50% chance of eliminating my pain completely, I would give it a try. It is up to each of us to decide for ourselves. Take care, Annette""A neurologist I saw many years ago at UC-SF, told me that he felt if a drug worked well, and then stopped working, to go completely off of it for at last six weeks and then try it again, and it would probably work. He saw me for a different kind of pain so I don<APO>t know if it would work for spasticity, but it might. Anyhow, in the non-drug arena, I love my little tiny, hot tub. I soak in it for 15-20 minutes before bedtime. It is truly the best thing for me that there is. The deep, wet, heat really soothes my muscles and helps relax me. I do way better dealing with pain during the day if I have slept some at night. I can<APO>t help you with shoes, I go barefoot as much as I can and wear Birkenstock<APO>s if I must leave the house/yard. I have two pairs of high top sneakers/boots to wear when I walk dogs for the pound once a week, but I kind of really hate them, lol. Their rules. Take care, Annette""Demerol is rarely used any more because we have learned that it breaks down into metabolites that can cause toxicity and seizures. It was used in the injection form in the hospitals where I have worked. I have not seen it used for chronic pain, as the metabolites would then build up in your system and cause problems with repeated doses. I don<APO>t know what all you have tried, but some people find one med that seems to work better than the others, so I would just work with your doctor and keep trying to find a safe drug that works for you. Take care, Annette""I am just putting my two bits into the conversation. I just read in Arthritis Today, May-June 2009, that a panel of government advisors for the FDA has recommended that propoxyfene, the active pain medicine in Darvon and Darvocet be banned from use in the US, as it has been in the United Kingdom since 2006. It has been connected to over 500 deaths in 2007. Its metabolites build up in the heart causing a slowed heart beat and poor contraction of the heart chambers. The medical studies I have read suggest Darvocet is no stronger than plain tylenol as far as pain relief goes. If you can<APO>t take the hydrocodone in Lortabs, then the next step would be oxycodone like in your Percocet. Taking a long acting opiate on a set schedule, then adding a short acting opiate on an as needed basis is the usual way the doctors go for chronic pain treatment. I do that myself. I have had a discectomy in my neck and herniated the disc above that one many years ago. I have spurs, etc. But, I would not go through surgery again on my spine unless I were losing function of some part of my body. I only had the first surgery when I started losing the use of my hands, it did fix that. Surgery when used as a pain management tool is not all that effective. It seems like I usually read that only about 50% of the patients who have surgery for pain relief, get it, and they may only get about a 50% reduction in their pain. Too risky a surgery for me for those kinds of odds. I would get a second opinion for the surgery with a neurosurgeon who is not affiliated with your current doctor<APO>s group. I would also see a pain management specialist and get his opinion on medical treatment, including opiates and other oral meds. I would avoid a pain management specialist who only does injections and procedures. Take care, Annette""The process he was talking about with oxycontin requiring more and more drug to get the same amount of relief is called tolerance. That happens with all kinds of opioids, including morphine. Changing to another opioid like morphine is often a good idea because there is only a partial cross tolerance between different opioids. If one develops a tolerance to one opioid, by changing to another opioid, one can take advantage of that and use less meds than one would have used if one stuck with the original drug. It sounds like that has happened with you. That is good, because you will be able to use less drugs over the years to get a better effect. You may develop tolerance to morphine also, it can gradually develop over time. Many doctors routinely change opioids for chronic pain patients, going from one to another, to another, over the years for this reason. Take care, Annette""Please go see your doctor and let him/her examine you and do any imaging studies he/she needs to do. This is really the best way to find out what is wrong. Take care, Annette""See a pain management specialist for this problem. When was your accident, and broken leg? What complications did you have that you would expect to be in pain for the rest of your life? Be aware that orthopedic surgeons are surgeons, they are used to fixing things, not prescribing long term medications. They simply are not trained for what you might need. Take care, Annette""It is curious that you do not mention your pain levels at all, just your medication and the doses. Some doctors believe that rotating opioids is a good thing and will result in lower doses with the same pain control. Stay positive and see how your pain levels respond. Besides all that, the more recent medical studies have found that an elongated T segment in ones EKG happens more frequently with higher doses of methadone. Maybe that is why they want to get you to a lower dose of methadone??? Take care, Annette""Hi, Randy It is always nice to have a name to put on a situation/post. I read a very recent article about a CY(don<APO>t recall the numerals) gene mutation having to do with tolerance to pain meds, it was in the last couple of months at the most. I would suggest you do a Google search or a search on Medscape for the article. I would try Medscape first as I get several emails from them daily to update me on various medical stuff. Are those your normal levels on or off of medication? I also wake up about every two hours, really stiff, and turn over and reposition my pillows. I take a long acting pain med, that I keep at my bedside, after about 4-5 hours and that helps relax me a bit so when it is time to get up I don<APO>t feel as bad as I would otherwise. My hot tub is my best friend and I sit in it every night before going to bed to help me relax. Take care, Annette""Taking methadone once a day for pain may be your problem. My pain management consultant just told me that methadone only works for pain when taken more frequently than that. What he stated was that methadones pain relieving properties are not as long lasting as its half life. So, talk to your doctor about taking a lower dose more often. They should add up to your total daily dose. So, if you are currently taking 90 mg a day, talk to your doctor about taking 30 mg three times a day. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I didn<APO>t realize this was such an old post.""Travel if you can afford it. My husband<APO>s best friend loves to travel. Me, I do volunteer work. Even though I am disabled, I can still find things that I can do. I think some depression is normal when you retire. My retirement was forced, due to disability, and I went through a terrible depression. I used cognitive behavioural therapy and found it was great. I think everyone should learn how to do it. Just remember that any transition is a temporary thing, depression should pass after a time. If it does not, talk to your doctor or find a good therapist to help you finish the transition. Take care, Annette""CBT generally means changing your response to whatever is coming at you into a positive instead of a negative. It is hard at first, but becomes easy to do as you get used to it. There is a difference between being a pessimist and being a realist, find a balance. I saw someone on TV the other day being interviewed and she said she believed that if she made it through a door and on to the next step in life, it was her responsibility to lend a hand to the person behind her when possible. I feel the same way. Why should the next person have to go through the bad things you did, if you can help them? Besides, you don<APO>t have to do volunteer work for people if you don<APO>t want to. How about helping out at the local animal shelter? Or wildlife rescue? I walk dogs once a week at the animal shelter, my dad was the guy that local folks dropped off birds of various kinds to help/rescue. Take care, Annette""I have helped doctors do many Bier Blocks for repair of acute injuries, but I have never heard of them being used for chronic pain. That must be something new. The ones that I am familiar with were used when you needed anesthesia for a hand/lower arm injury so that you could repair it. They used it mainly for reducing fractures, dislocations, and doing some suturing. What was done was we put an IV in the hand on the injured arm, once that was going the doctor put a B/P cuff on the upper arm and we pumped it up high enough to control the blood flow to the arm. The doctor injected a local anesthetic into the IV and as it perfused the arm, it went numb only as far up as the Blood Pressure cuff. While it was totally numb the doctor did the procedure he needed to do. Then the B/P cuff was slowly let down and the hand gradually regained feeling. It was not long acting. Then the patient usually went home with appropriate pain meds to take orally. Perhaps the doctor would use a longer acting local anesthetic for the procedure you are talking about, or it could even be a totally different procedure with the same name. It sounds interesting. Take care, Annette""Sorry you cannot get what you feel you need. I assume you mean oxycodone, but I am not sure. You probably won<APO>t find a doctor that loose with RXs where you are. I would think twice about how you present yourself to the doctor. Take care, Annette""Are you allergic to codeine? I would trust your doctors to prescribe what you need after surgery. Take care, Annette""Hi, Brad Just explain to your doctor the things that you are unable to do in your day to day living due to the pain coming back. How long have you been taking the hydrocodone? It may be time for you to use a long acting opioid around the clock. See what your doctor says. Take care, Annette""I agree with Grace. I hope you are doing this under the supervision of a doctor. The worst is probably over by now. Take care, Annette""You might try a free clinic again. The one that I used to volunteer in had an all volunteer medical staff, so the doctors changed frequently. Maybe you will get a nicer doctor next time. Good luck with the chiropractor, be careful. Take care, Annette""Hi, Grace I didn<APO>t read Pesky<APO>s reply as stern, just as direct. Certainly not harsh. I saw some of the same inconsistencies in Kim<APO>s post, so she was pretty much saying what I would have said. It is hard dealing with just the written word and not having facial expressions, etc. It is good to ask for clarification whenever one does not understand. Take care, Annette""If it was an injection into the muscle, it makes no difference which hip she put it in. The medicine is absorbed into your blood stream, and works systemically. Usually if it is any where deeper than a muscle, the doctor gives the injection himself. I have given solumedrol IM many times as a nurse. Take care, and keep in touch. Annette""Welcome to the group. I am sorry, but I don<APO>t have an answer to your question. Do you have pain in both shoulders or just one? I have Fibromyalgia, disc disease in my neck, and migraines. I get along okay. I am a bit older than you at 62. The researchers will find answers to our pain, don<APO>t even think about living with it the rest of your life. Try and live more day to day. It makes it easier. Take care, Annette""Of course, it is possible that the meds are affecting your memory. Discuss all this with your doctor first of all. Be careful about cutting down dosages yourself, unless your doctor told you it was okay. The diuretic also treats high blood pressure, and the blood pressure can sneak up higher and higher without causing any symptoms for you until you have a heart attack, stroke, or kidney failure, and then it is kind of late to be messing with meds. Talk to your doctor!!! The other thing to do is write yourself notes, do crossword puzzles to hone your memory skills, etc. Work at the problem of memory loss from both ends. Take care, Annette""Are you still around? It occurred to me that I had not seen a post for you in quite awhile. Hugs, Annette""Hi, Grace Do what you can to find a center that specializes in this condition. A friend uses art therapy for an issue she has, and although she doesn<APO>t feel like she has any talent, she really enjoys and feels like she gets a lot from this program. Take care, Annette""This AMs, 10/16/12, newspaper stated 15 people had died in the meningitis outbreak, in 15 states. It recommended ALL doctors contact pats. who got ANY kind of injection from this pharmacy. Two more drugs are being investigated per the article. The company has recalled all the medicines it makes, also according to this article. I would contact your doctor in writing, if you have had any kind of injection recently, and ask him to reply in writing where the meds came from, and the name of the meds used along with lot numbers. I would not leave my health in the hands of anyone else. Take care, Annette""As of the newspaper dated 10/19/2012 at least ""20 people have died"" and 254 got sick. Oregon stopped dealing with this company due to a totally different problem. Oregon Board of Pharmacy revoked their license based on an investigation into ""bogus prescriptions"". Apparently, the pharmacy company was accused of shipping drugs in bulk to Oregon providers, and then later getting individual RXs after the fact. By law, compounding pharmacies must ship drugs in patient specific amounts ordered with already written individual RXs. Best of luck everyone, I am so glad I never got any injections at all. Take care, Annette""As of 10/23/12, the newspaper said 23 people had died from these injections. Sad.... Take care, Annette""She should just call her doctor and find out what the risk is for her. They should have documented the lot numbers of the steroid and which patients got them, this information should be somewhere. I would not leave anything to a doctors<APO> office. Take care, Annette""According to my newspaper here in Portland, you can add Michigan and Indiana to those states as off 10/6/2012. The numbers reported are very small. I would call my doctor if I was in any of these states and had this done, the article said the sooner one is put on appropriate treatment, the better. Take care, Annette""The newspaper added Ohio and Minnesota to the list, so now there are nine states total as of 10/7/12. All the steroids came from a compounding pharmacy. According to the article the FDA has not approved these meds, and tolerates the practices of compounding pharmacies as long as they do not ship across state lines and produce massive amounts of meds. I don<APO>t get how they can have problems in nine states if they don<APO>t ship across state lines, unless they compound the drugs in each state. That makes no sense financially. I also don<APO>t get why doctors would even use these compounding pharmacies since the drugs used in the doses used were readily available from regular pharmacies. I thought the whole idea of compounding pharmacies was to custom produce meds in particular doses that folks needed that were not available in mass production. Take care, Annette""Hi, Mike Haven<APO>t seen you in a long time. I hope all is well with you and yours. I am glad that you and your son are doing fine, but I would not assume anything. I would contact your doctors and ask for written confirmation of the name of the pharmaceutical company that they got their product from. According to the newspaper the name of the company involved is the New England Compounding Center. Today<APO>s paper said that the company involved shipped 17,700 single dose vials to 23 states. And that inspectors found at least one sealed vial contaminated with fungus. They are still doing tests of course. They feel that up to 13,000 people got steroid injections in their spine or other joints. The sad news is that they were not only used on spines which could cause spinal meningitis, but also they were used on joints like knees and shoulders. I would assume this means they could have other sites for infections, but it didn<APO>t say exactly what could happen. There have been 105 illnesses and 9 deaths so far, according to the newspaper. Makes me glad I haven<APO>t had any of these injections. Take care, Annette""Pesky ran through most of what I would tell you already. I would also suggest cognitive behavioural therapy both for any mood disorders you may have, and for just dealing with day to day chronic pain. I agree with Pesky about more surgery, be sure it is what you wish to do and would be useful. I would also thank you for your military service. Take care, Annette""See a good orthopedic or sports doctor, an MD who knows what to look for. See what he says. It is not worth being messed up at your age then going through life in chronic pain like we have. Take care, Annette""Sounds like it is time to start some new traditions at your house. Maybe a lot luck where everyone brings something instead of you doing all the cooking. Let people know way ahead of time so there are no surprises. My mom announced when she was about 62 or so that in future she would go wherever the party was, but she was not cooking and the party would not be at her house. She stayed in a motel sometimes and at our house sometimes, depending on the situation. That seemed very strange to us, but it meant she had a quiet place to go relax after dinner. Take care, Annette""What does ""position your congressman"" mean? Take care, Annette""I think you meant to write ""petition"" rather than ""position""??? I am on methadone for chronic pain, and many, many (about 40) years ago I worked as an RN at a methadone clinic for heroin addicts. I get the discussion, thanks. Take care, Annette""Ask your pcp for another referral. Explain to him in person at your next appt. that your insurance company wants you to try meds before injections, and that the PM doctor you saw refuses to do it. Some PM doctors are interventionalists only and do not ever give oral meds, you might have just got one of these. Ask when you make the appt. next time. Make sure you are both on the same page. Take care, Annette""Please talk to your doctor about all of this. Take care, Annette""If you can<APO>t reach him fairly quickly by phone, make an appt. to go see him in person and discuss these issues with him. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Dawnssuffering, The only positive thing I have to tell you is that the Medicare goes two years after your date of disability is determined and approved by SSDI. So, if you are approved for SSDI, and it is long enough ago, you might also get Medicare right away. I was approved for SSDI 14 months after I applied, and they set my date of disability back six months earlier than I requested it. So, I was eligible for Medicare within 4-5 months. I had medical insurance through my husband<APO>s employer at that time, but it was sure good to know it was available. It is my personal thought that the government hopes we will all die off before we can get Medicare. What a dumb rule!!! Take care, Annette""You could also try tramadol. I found it was as good as about 1 vicodin myself. We are all different though. Talk to your doctor about it. Take care, Annette""Weight does not matter as far as FMS goes. I have lost the same 50 pounds of weight twice since I have had it, it is gone again, and it did not make a bit of difference in my pain. I only have FMS though. It does make a huge difference in how I feel globally, not with the pain though. However, it does matter for your knees. Every extra pound of weight puts 4 pounds of pressure on each knee. Every time you stand up it does matter. You CAN lose weight. Find a form of exercise that you enjoy doing. For me it was belly dancing, lol. I am 62 and dance in the TV room where NO ONE can see me. I dance along with DVDs on the TV set, every day. I do an hour a day, every day. I have done it for 2-3 years now. I don<APO>t diet, but I probably should. I lose a very small amount of weight each time I see my doctor. A couple of pounds every three months. You can exercise in a chair if you want to. There are DVDs and stuff on You Tube for everything nowadays. You don<APO>t need to lose a lot of weight to make it worth your while. You can do what you like, but change the attitude you have about losing weight. Do a simple calories in and calories out thing. Write down everything that you put in your mouth for awhile. See a dietician for portion control and exercise advise if you need it, I learned a lot, and I am already an RN. I only saw her twice. I would discuss your fears about seeing a PM doctor with your pcp, then screen them on the phone, there are a bunch of strict interventionists out there that you do not want to see. There may be something out there that you have not tried that could help you, besides losing weight. It is not an either/or thing, try both.... Keep in touch. Take care, Annette""I take gabapentin, but only at night, not several times a day. I didn<APO>t start it for the longest time because I was scared of the sedating side effects. My pcp finally said she was having good results with other patients taking it only at bedtime for all day pain relief. That was when I finally started taking it. I have been on it for 12-14 years now. I did notice a drunken feeling at first, but it was only at night, not all day long. I made sure my husband knew I was taking a new drug, and he kept an eye out for me. I also use Lidoderm patches sometimes over the most painful areas. That also helps. I too had a motor vehicle accident due to meds, many years ago. It is very scary. Take care, Annette""You decide for yourself of course. I always tell my husband now when I start to take a different drug, or change the dose of an old one. It is hard for family to tell a person not to drive their car, or that they are not themselves due to meds for many different reasons. Give them your permission to do so. Tell them it is temporary but something you really need them to do for you. Find one person who is around you a lot, and really talk to them. Some meds take longer to work than others. I hope you find some answers to all your concerns. Take care, Annette""Best of luck to you with the injections. The sad thing about MRIs is they are not good at showing who might be in pain and who might not be. A study done a number of years ago showed that out of 700 people who had had MRIs, it was not possible to predict who should have pain and who should not. Many folks with really bad looking MRIs had no symptoms at all, and others with fairly normal MRIs had horrible pain. Take care, Annette""Unfortunately, there is no test for pain. Be very firm with the doctor. Try telling him what you would like to do, but can<APO>t because of pain. Set a goal with him. Meanwhile, I also hope the injections work for you. Take care, Annette""It sounds like you need to stick with one doctor. I would choose the rehab one or the pcp. But, you know them and it is up to you, you should pick the one you feel most comfortable with. I would not bother with the ER. You have a chronic condition and need to deal with it. Take care, Annette""Hi, Emily. I am so sorry for your loss. Why do you ask for a doctor who is not scared of the DEA? That is not a good measurement of a ""good"" doctor. Why can<APO>t you get out of bed? Please remember that a good doctor must justify his decision to use opiates and benzos. They are no longer suggested to be used together bad interactions can happen. We cannot post the names and contact information for doctors here, you must provide an email address and do it one on one. I live in Oregon and don<APO>t know any doctors in your area. Take care, Annette""You need to discuss all this with your doctor. Have you tried tramadol or NSAIDs? They are the next thing down from Lortab. How old are you? How old is your paralysis? Are you looking at short or long term use? Why do you have neck/shoulder pain? What else can you try as far as non-drug treatments? These questions popped into my mind right away. Take care, Annette""Also instead of saying you have terrible pain, tell him what kinds of activities you cannot do due to pain. Just a thought. Take care, Annette""Hi, Beth This is totally off topic. Welcome back, I have not seen you for awhile. I am glad you are here. Hugs, Annette""It is best to discuss these findings with the doctor that ordered the test. He presumably has examined you and can put together the two things appropriately. Take care, Annette""All I can suggest is to take another person with you, an adult to take notes conspicuously. Unfortunately, doctors seem to do better at listening if you have someone with you. A witness, if you will. Take care, Annette""I would not repeat that visit either. Find a new doctor. Really think about the pain and rate it as you feel. Any doctor who so blatantly changes it in front of you is crazy. Take care, Annette""I am so sorry that you have that compulsion to take more of the pain pills than you ought to. That may be something you need to deal with at some point in your life. Take care, Annette""It is nice of you to give God the good grace that you do, but I believe in you. I have known a lot of folks that believed in God, and were not graced with the miracles you have been blessed with. God may play a part in things, but I believe that the person involved also gets some points for hard work. YOU get those points. Take care, Annette""I use a daily pill box for all my meds, including pain pills. I don<APO>t take more each day than what is in the box. I fill my boxes once a week. My husband<APO>s too. As long as one never takes the pills to get anything other than pain relief, and takes no more than what the doctor orders, I would find it difficult to call someone an addict. I am so in awe of folks like you, Grace, who have dealt with both addiction and chronic pain. I really do not know how you do it. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know. Many surgeons say that we, chronic pain patients, should not be on opiates, but they don<APO>t have any real answers for us either. I don<APO>t know what the answer is for you, but I would talk to several pain management doctors, both interventionists and non-interventionists, and see what they all have to say. Continue doing your own research, and then you must decide what to do next. Take care, Annette""Get the book, ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns, MD. Read it and follow what it suggests. It might be nice to be able to see a therapist three times a week for CBT, I don<APO>t know because I never did it that way. My therapist suggested the book when I moved away and I bought it and did it on my own. I am also a retired RN. Still licensed in Calif. It is a good read anyway. I have been using the techniques it suggests for many years. It cured my depression completely. It can work for you too to some degree. But you have to be willing to really work at it every day. Best of luck to you. Keep in touch. Take care, Annette""I have never heard of Nurses House before either. I will check out their website later today. I am still a licensed RN also. I did use the state Dept. of Disability and Voc. Rehab. in Nevada. They were great. Take care, Annette""""Obamacare"" is already the law, and is taking place gradually as it was designed to do. It will not effect my doctor at all, as far as seeing me goes. I asked my pcp ages ago. Many doctors support this. Take care, Annette""I am an RN and have seen both PAs and NPs in the past, no problems for me. They are trained to handle most kinds of office visits anyway. Many people already say here that they see NPs and PAs in their PM doctors<APO> offices. That has been true for many years now. So far, all my doctors (pcp, and surgeon, and orthopedist, and PM) and my husband<APO>s doctor (pcp) will take Medicare and are glad to continue to see us. I check with them every year, when I double check Medicare to make sure we are on the right plans. I do disagree with any reduction in Medicare payments to doctors. I do not agree with ""Obamacare"" because I feel you need a single payer system, NO insurance companies at all, no Medicare, no Medicaid, no VA, just one big system for everyone. Hugs, Annette""I don<APO>t say you and Swank are not being truthful, it just has not happened to me or my family out here on the west coast. I would not blame a doctor for not accepting less $$$ that it takes for them to survive and pay their bills. I thought that Medicare might be a problem when I finally needed it, but it has not been a problem where I live. Take care, Annette""I doubt the flu shot caused the rotator cuff problems although it may be possible, it is more likely that you just happened to get the flu shot when it started to hurt. It doesn<APO>t really matter medically, only legally, if you cannot afford medical treatment, and are planning to sue the person who gave you the injection. What a mess. Nothing is worse for chronic pain than not being able to sleep at night, no matter what causes the pain. Sleeping restores us and allows us to get on with our day. I don<APO>t sleep well, for lots of reasons, it totally sucks. Take care, Annette""I belly dance for an hour every night. In my TV room with DVDs, no humans are allowed to watch, lol. I have found the same thing you have, I forget about having pain while I am doing it. I do not have the 24 hour relief that you mentioned, but at least it does not hurt right then. As far as the flu shots are concerned, speak up and take your business elsewhere. We did that, and they listened and modified their process. Make sure the injection is delivered to the body of the muscle, not the very top near the insertion site. Take care, Annette""Good for you. I am so happy for you. I have had some bursitis in my right shoulder, I mentioned it to my doctor but put off doing anything until next time I see her in July. I may need to check this out. Take care, Annette""Thanks for the follow-up post, I am glad you are feeling better. It is rare for someone to post a follow-up post, but very welcome. Take care, Annette""A few years ago, my husband and I both got our flu shots at the local pharmacy and the pharmacist who gave them did it incorrectly, even after I warned her and she assured me she knew how to do it. (I am an old RN) She gave them to both of us far too high to hit the body of the muscle in the upper arm. She hit where the muscle attached to the bone. It hurt both of us for several days. The pharmacist at the new place where we went last year and this year followed my instructions and did really well. You never know until you put your hand on the upper arm, exactly where the deltoid muscle goes in each individual. She even commented on this while she gave me my injection this year, having avoided the shoulder joint in another patient. Doing lots and lots of injections is usually the key to giving good ones. Practice makes perfect. Take care, Annette""I do hope you get well soon with the use of the steroids. The pharmacist who gave me my flu vaccine injection this year (not the year when the pharmacist gave it too high), mentioned that now she was feeling the muscle with her left hand and giving the shot with her right hand, and she really had noticed that everyone is created a bit differently. She understood what I had said about giving the injection into the ""body"" of the muscle, and not into the insertion site where it connects to the bone. It is nice to know that someone got it and will pass that knowledge along to others. Take care, Annette""The med. asst. at my doctor<APO>s office simply holds up the card with the numbers and the faces on it and you pick the one that most nearly reflects what you feel now. She does it along with your vital signs. Anything more than that about your pain, and you need to discuss it with the doctor. You are right, it always works best if you and your doctor are on the same page as far as any communication goes. We are both fine, as is my son and his family. I hope you and your daughter are doing well too. Take care, Annette""Yes, it would make life easier for the doctors, but why not just trust what the patient says, and use whatever $$$ there is for treatment? If there were unlimited funds to spend on medical stuff, I would have more energy for this kind of thing. I worked in the ER as an RN and such a device would be very helpful, it would quickly weed out the addicts from the pain sufferers. But, there are not unlimited funds for medical research, and as a patient I would prefer they spend the $$$ on treatment issues. Take care, Annette""I am usually at a 6-7 on this scale. What are her definitions of ""mild"" painkillers, if it is only NSAIDs what happens to folks who cannot take them? Where would tolerance to narcotics come into play here? Take care, Annette""It would be nice if $$$ was unlimited to use some of it to devise something to tell us objectively what pain levels someone has. However, there is not unlimited $$$, so for now I would rather it be spent for treatment issues. The FDA gets a lot of petitions, I guess I am willing to wait right now to see what passes and what doesn<APO>t. It is pretty much a roll of the dice to see if opioids are limited in non-cancer patients after 90 days. This is a great discussion, thanks for being a part of it. Take care, Annette""I agree that the faces can feel condescending, I think the office I go to uses them because they deal with a lot of kids and non-English speakers. I feel communication is the most important thing. I tend to think that the whole pain scale thing is more about trends in chronic pain that about anything else. If someone who always reports their pain as a 3-4 on whatever scale they are using, suddenly reports a 7-8, or vice versa, a nurse or doctor should take notice and discuss this with the patient. My husband was walking on a broken hip from AVN and described his pain as a 2, repeatedly. All he was taking was ibuprofen. His MD only finally got an xray to shut me up, he was very apologetic. My sweetie really believes that if you recognize pain and give it a number it will live up to that number. Pain score rating does not work for him at all. We are all different. Hugs, Annette""I agree, it would be great to have some kind of machine or test that told the doctors exactly what your pain levels were, but I don<APO>t believe that it is likely to happen any time soon. Take care, Annette""I do agree with you, but money is a finite resource, and I think it is better spent on treatments at this time. I also agree with the possibility that making money has trumped figuring this out. Both my parents died of lung cancer due at least in part to smoking, I agree with you that the tobacco industry knew what was going on long before we were told. Take care, Annette""Sorry, but I do have considerable pain when I do not take my opioid medicines. I just do not agree with you about this subject. I do not participate in many on line petitions. I am a retired RN, and am also aware of folks committing suicide, not being counted properly. Center punching a tree with your car, or hitting a wall head on. These are usually counted as MVAs not suicides. I have always considered suicide a permanent fix for a temporary problem in many cases. Of course, money talks, it does in most cases. It certainly does in medical cases. Medicaid pays for poor care, and if one does not have even that, free clinics are the only choice left. US medical care is probably one of the best in the world, but you have to be able to access that care. That is were we fail badly. Take care, Annette""Hi Beth, Your explanation is interesting, but does not seem to work with my pain levels. I was well known for my ability as a nurse to give a painless injection. It is all about how the person gives it. I must have learned right. it would be an insult for someone to label the pain from an injection from me at a 3. I have had migraines for many years, and they also do not fit with the pain scale you mentioned. They can be anything from a 1 to a 9. I personally think the nausea is worse than the pain, I hate throwing up. Someone cannot live alone at a 7 according to your scale, many of us have no choice and function fairly well at a 6 or a 7. You do have to remember that chronic pain is not always a 6-7, it varies. Chronic pain is very different from acute pain. Perhaps on a day when our score is lower we will do that load of laundry, and when we have a bad day we won<APO>t. For me, I like the scale that shows a smiley face at the 0, and tears and crying on the 10. Although that would not work for people who are stoic. My husband had AVN of the hip and had a crushed femoral head, he claimed a 2 on the pain scale, even though he was walking with a cane at the time. He really believes that if you do not say you are in pain, you will experience less pain, I do not know if he is right or not. I think using the scale for a trend is the best thing to do. Once your doctor gets to know you better, he will know what you consider okay and what you don""t. If you go through life at a 0-2 on whatever scale is used, and all of a sudden your score is a 6-7 or even higher, then it would be nice for someone to notice. Take care, Annette""I really think it is a matter of what goes in, calorie-wise and what is used up, calorie-wise. I have lost about 60 pounds now, over several years, mostly by increasing my exercise to one hour a day. There are certainly plateaus, and it is a slow business, but I feel generally better. I don<APO>t think it matters much for my pain levels, but globally I do feel better. Do whatever exercise you can do for the rest of your life. Something you truly enjoy. So far, I have not altered my poor eating habits, I guess that would be next. I don<APO>t smoke, drink, do illegal drugs, etc. so I have no other bad habits to give up, lol. Take care, Annette""Taking opiates for chronic headaches is usually a really bad idea. Have you heard of rebound headaches? How did the doctor decide that your spinal problems were causing your headaches? I had both, and had surgery for the cervical spine problems, it did nothing for my headaches, I still get them. Thank goodness my surgeon never told me that surgery would cure my headaches too. I would be very angry with him. Morphine does not come in any kind of patch. I suspect your sister might be on fentanyl patches. Unless you are dealing with some other kind of pain besides headaches, I would discuss with your doctor the possibility of getting off the opiates and then I would suggest you see a headache specialist. Take care, Annette""I agree with Dave, she needs to see her own pcp and get a diagnosis first thing. That will lead to effective treatment. Take care, Annette""Did you discuss this with the doctor who diagnosed you? My Merck Manual says that RA is usually symmetrical, but can begin in any joint. What tests did the rheumatologist do to make this diagnosis? My rheumie could tell by looking at my hands that I had the beginning of OA, even before I had any pain or stiffness. As a nurse, I can see what he pointed out to me in the peripheral joints of my fingers. Take care, Annette""Very interesting, Caprice. It does make sense. Our newspaper said that as of 10/27/2012 there had been 25 deaths and >300 infections in 18 states related to these tainted steroid shots. Very sad, people getting these injections to relieve horrible pain, and they end up like this. Take care, Annette""A second company is recalling a bunch of its medicines voluntarily. None of them are connected with any infections at all. Apparently it has been talking to the FDA about sterility concerns in its manufacturing methods. I am so glad it is doing this voluntarily ahead of the game with the FDA. Take care, Annette""Sorry, this company<APO>s name is Ameridose. They are conducting a voluntary recall of all their products. They do have a phone number to contact if you have products from their company to return. Take care, Annette""40 years ago when I was in nursing school we were taught to tell our patients to take their pain meds as soon as they had pain, NOT to wait until it was really bad. The studies back then showed that people took less pain meds in the long run that way, than people did who waited until their pain was really bad to take their meds. It is normal for surgeons to prescribe pain killers with no refills. Talk to your surgeon and explain what you are doing and why. Ask him if he will consider giving you one more refill if you need it, that way you won<APO>t worry about it so much. I would deal with the surgeon for now, not your family doctor. It sounds like you are doing fairly well, pretty much as expected. As you are more active, you will have several days of increased pain, then things should calm down again. Take care, Annette""Follow up with the doctor that the ER told you to follow up with. It should be an orthopedist or a neurologist, or your family doctor. With the price of ERs these days, I would probably refuse to leave the ER until my pain was controlled, if I got to the point to even going to an ER. I would see my pcp or follow up with a neurologist myself. Take care, Annette""Is the doctor predicting a 70% chance of complete relief, or something else? Like a 70% chance of a 50% decrease in your current pain? I really think that the patient<APO>s expectations of any surgery or procedure makes a huge difference in the outcome. Make sure you and the doctor really understand and agree with what to expect. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know why you are itching so severely. Please do not assume anything. My cousin had a very rare disease, a type of lymphoma, I think. it killed him in the end. See your doctor again, and again, and a different doctor if necessary. But get a diagnosis and begin treatment of some kind. Evaluate the treatment, and discuss it again with the doctor. My cousin blew it all off, he was sure itching could not be anything serious. He was wrong. For you, it will probably just be a medication interaction or something like that. Find out though, do not let the doctors tell you nothing at all. Take care, Annette""Opioid withdrawal is unpleasant, but not deadly, however withdrawing from some tranquilizers can be very dangerous. Please speak to one of your doctors before doing anything with your meds. Many opioids do cause itching as a side effect, it usually passes after awhile. I had it too, but not like you describe. It was fairly mild and went away on its own after a few weeks. Make an appt. with your doctor, and speak to him in person. That is usually better than playing phone tag anyhow. Take care, Annette""I have used about six or seven different kinds of generics of hydrocodone/APAP 10/325 over many years, they all seemed to work fine for me. I used both of the kinds you specifically mentioned. I guess we are all different. Take care, Annette""Or tell him in person,after you make an appt. to see him. It is simple to deal with. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I did not realize this was an old post, please ignore my last post. Take care, Annette""I agree with Beth on what to ask for, but I would do it in person at an appt. rather than on the phone. For sure, do not talk to anyone about this on the phone other than the prescribing doctor. Take care, Annette PS, Hugs to Beth!!!""I think discussing it with your own doctor beforehand is wisest. Have a plan and use it when you need to. I talked about this with my doctor and she prefers to actually see the patient in person, and she keeps a couple of emergency appts. aside every day for this reason. I have always been able to get in to see her the same day or the next day at the latest. The only communication she and I have over the phone is pre-arranged and is for how new medications are working, etc. My last doctor in Reno, NV, did all of his call backs that evening after the office closed. He didn<APO>t talk to anyone on the phone during the day. His asst. pulled all the charts and left him a list of people and their problems. His wife must have spent a lot of evenings at home alone, poor thing. I have heard of doctors using email now, but my doctor doesn<APO>t prefer that. Take care, Annette""I did not really understand that first sentence that you quoted, so I did not bother to read the rest of the post, addressed to me. The only folks I ever knew who stayed in the hospital that long were back in the days that you could not get a bed for a trached patient in a nursing home. That was a long time ago, they simply did not do vent care or trach care in nursing homes back then. Two comatose ladies were in a room together in an acute hospital, an elderly woman and a very young one. The elderly lady was finally transferred and passed away within days. The younger one was still there when I left and moved elsewhere. My husband had AVN due to a fall and a cracked hip, in my humble opinion, the W/C folks said it was due to steroid use 25 years ago when he was treated for lymphoma. We had health insurance so we did not argue with them. He had hip replacement surgery and went back to work as a big truck mechanic. I really do not care what this person thinks about me. I have learned to not waste my time on small things. I learned this during my son<APO>s third deployment into a war zone, some years ago. I also like James Joyce. Hugs, Annette""Best of luck to you both. Hip pain is difficult to diagnose, sometimes the problem is in the hip, sometimes it is in the spine. My husband had a hip replacement surgery for post-traumatic AVN nearly 4 years ago. He adores his PCP. However, he is not honest with him about pain concerns, etc. He was waking me up at night every time he turned over with his screaming in pain before the surgery. (It was not the reason for the visit to the doctor.) I told the doctor about that myself, and still during the doctor<APO>s physical evaluation regarding the hip pain my husband told him the highest his pain ever got was a 2 out of 10. Six months later, we saw the doctor again for something else, again I told him my perception of what was going on with the hip pain. This time he xrayed the hip, the head of the femur was completely caved in. He showed us the xrays, and put my husband off of work. My husband was finally honest about the pain levels. After he finally had the surgery, things were much better as far as the hip went. He still is not honest about symptoms at times. Sometimes it is not the doctor, sometimes it is the patient. Go with your sweetie, and sit and listen in the corner, if you haven<APO>t already. Tell the doctor your concerns if your sweetie doesn<APO>t come clean himself. Take care, Annette""Be as naked as she can be. A loose fitting caftan is fine at home, she does not need to wear underclothes if they hurt. I like cotton and rayon the most. Check the care labels, make sure they are machine washable. I have bought mine mostly through various catalogs, lots of them come this time of year. I wish I could suggest a specific one. I am so sorry your aunt is going through this, and hope she recovers soon. Take care, Annette""Please, if you smoke, quit before you have any further surgery. It really inhibits healing in bone, as well as other tissues. I agree, I think CTBeth is the one who deals with this thing all the time, so she ought to know all about it. Good luck. Take care, Annette""Thank you for your military service. I am so sorry that you have gone through all of this. Take care, Annette""Oxycodone can be had without any added drugs at all. Drugs like oxycodone and hydrocodone, with APAP, added can also be gotten with only 325 mg. per tablet. Take care, Annette""Itching is either a side effect, or an allergic reaction to opioids, your body doesn<APO>t know if you were taking them legally or illegally. Use or abuse doesn<APO>t really matter in this case. I hope you are feeling better by now. Take care, Annette""I hope you are feeling better. From what I have read in my drug book, allergic reactions usually have hives (an allergic rash), along with the itching, but opioid side effects have itching, but NO hives. It is very important for the doctor to know the difference. Take care, Annette""Muscle relaxants do not work on the muscles of the GI tract, they only work on skeletal muscles. They may be somewhat sedating, which would make it seem like they take the edge off. The meds they use for the GI tract are completely different, you still have to just keep trying different ones until you find the one that works best for you with the fewest side effects. Take care, Annette""I tried to look these two drugs up in my drug books and on line and found a different spelling for Hycosamine, but it was the same drug I thought it was, an antispasmodic. I used to take it for urinary tract spasms. Dicyclomine is also known as Bentyl, an antismasmodic that is usually used for GI problems. It works on the involuntary muscles of the GI system, not the skeletal muscles. Hyoscyamine (closest spelling I could find) is otherwise known as Levbid, is also an antispasmodic commonly used for GI and urinary tract muscle spasms, both involuntary muscles, not skeletal muscles. I didn<APO>t find anything under the spelling you gave me, so I am not certain this is the same drug you mentioned. Antispasmodics are generally for the involuntary muscles of the GI and urinary tract.The doctor may have told you they relax the muscles of the GI system, different words for the same things. Muscle RELAXANTS generally refer to things like flexeril, Zanaflex, etc., they are for the skeletal muscles and do not affect the GI or urinary tract or the muscles that help make them work. This is the way I have learned about them in nursing school and since in general use in nursing. These two drugs are useful for the kind of GI problem that you mentioned. The muscles relaxants like flexeril and Zanaflex are the muscle relaxants usually used for skeletal muscles spasms like you would find in back pain, but would not be useful for GI pain and muscle spasms. Antispasmodics and muscle relaxants are two different kinds of drugs. I may have misunderstood what you were saying, because I think of these two drugs as antispasmodics, not muscle relaxants, which are a different class of drugs entirely, according to what I have learned. In different geographic areas, doctors use different terms to describe various medical things, including medical equipment and drugs. Take care, Annette""If it hurts after you eat, I would try different dietary changes. An elimination diet may help you figure out if there are certain foods that trigger this kind of pain for you. I tried all kinds of different dietary changes to see if certain foods triggered my migraines. Even healthy food can trigger various kinds of pain. Take care, Annette""I am always glad to be of help when I can. Those are the two best meds for GI spasms. The doctor is correct in asking you to start at a lower dose and increase it slowly. Often one can avoid side effects that way. I suggest you look into cognitive behavioural therapy. It really helps with dealing with stress and anxiety. I suggest a book called ""Feeling Great"", by Dr. David Burns, MD. I just got one in paperback for a friend for $7.99 at Borders Books. I read through the whole book, then picked out techniques that I thought would help me. He has a whole program for you to use with worksheets you can copy to track your progress. It can be used with a therapist or on your own. There are several different kinds of diets you can try. Discuss this with the doctor who manages your GI problems. There are dairy free diets, and gluten free diets. There is also the basic elimination diet. Your doctor should be able to refer you to a nutritionist, a licensed dietitian to help you with that if you cannot find one on line. What we eat is so wound up in our lives, and it is difficult to really change unless you make a total commitment to it. You won<APO>t see magic results, it takes time. But it is possible and it may help your symptoms a lot. Take care, Annette""I would ask her for links to articles that show heart disease is related to opioids, see what she comes up with. Read them carefully yourself. What did she suggest, anything? Kaiser doctors, unfortunately, are often between a rock and a hard place. Kaiser is their employer and signs their checks, they must go along with Kaiser<APO>s program. They don<APO>t always get to provide input with Kaiser<APO>s decisions. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t have any answers for you. Doctor do research that shows new things all the time. I don<APO>t believe that all doctors are bad people. As we go through the years we discover new things. It was thought that asthma was all do to emotional problems when I was in nursing school. Now we know better. I don<APO>t know if opioids are dangerous or not, I would ask again for links to articles that you can read and evaluate yourself. Include the facts of exactly why you are taking opioids. and your current limitations due to kidney disease. Then you must decide if Kaiser is the right place for you. This has not come up with me so far. Take care, Annette""Please do not forget double vision as a side effect of opiates. A family friend who also has a PhD in pharmacy called me and told me the although he cannot find any studies linking the two, he did find some ""anecdotal evidence"" that connected the two. I will ask my prescribing doctor about it on Friday when I see her. Take care, Annette""Just to be clear, I did not blame the Affordable Care Plan also known as Obama care. <UD>Swank<UD> and I agree on most things, Obama care is not one of them. She is against and I am for. Take care, Annette""I am not positive, but I live in a state where this could happen. In Oregon where I live, Medicaid could decline to pay for pain meds, as they only pay for evidence based treatments for a given number of conditions each year. When I first moved here fibromyalgia was not covered at all, so drugs for it would also not be covered. Medicare does cover this condition and its treatments, including meds. Part D Medicare would pay for pain meds whether they were for fibromyalgia or for something else. I moved here more than 15 years ago. I am unaware how things work with these programs now. Take care, Annette""As usual, one must understand the difference between a doctor writing a prescription or writing an order for pain meds (for inpatients) and the patient<APO>s ability to fill that prescription due to financial status. This has been a very interesting discussion. Of course, depending on what state you happen to live in, and understanding the great variance from state to state, and how you doctor words things on forms can have a huge impact on how things are covered and by what program. Take care, Annette""I can understand the problem, and there is not an answer. The state of Oregon where I live has decided, right or wrong, that they will only pay a given amount of money for healthcare. The way they have opted to do this, is to pay only for proven treatments, for a specific number of illnesses each year. If the illness you have does not fall on that list, you lose. There is no discussion about it. Nor is there any discussion about Medicaid paying for any or all treatments, if they haven<APO>t proven to be useful for illnesses that are covered. Until the Affordable Care Act, we had a lottery for childless adults who could not afford healthcare. You did not get automatic coverage based on financial need. This is my understanding of our healthcare program, I might be wrong. Take care, Annette""What are you talking about? What post of mine are you responding to? Antidepressants do work for some people with chronic pain problems, and not for others, same with side effects. Take care, Annette""Not all pain is related to inflammation. I don<APO>t smoke, I have pain from an illness that is not considered inflammatory. No specific diet has been found to be useful for my condition, fibromyalgia. Everyone should quit smoking tobacco, fortunately I never got started. Watching both my parents die of lung cancer related to smoking made not starting an easy choice when I was younger. What will this person do if they quit smoking and their pain does not go away? They will probably go right back to smoking. People should quit smoking tobacco for many reasons, they all need to find their own pathway. Eating properly is also healthy. So is exercise. So is being a healthy weight for ones height. I am glad you have managed to lower your pain scores so well. I hope you continue to do well. Take care, Annette""I am sorry, I misunderstood your premise. I tried a bunch of ""natural"" remedies, including magnesium, way back in the olden days when I was first diagnosed. None of it helped much at all. Diet has not been shown to matter much with FMS according to all the current research. I am doing well, thank you so much. I exercise an hour a day, curb some activities, and take my meds. Take care, Annette""A compression tank top sounds like a better deal to me, something to try anyhow. As a woman, let me tell you that a bra never kept me from having pain. Talk to your doctor please. Pain is not normal in the breast area, it would be better to find out what is causing it, than try something to just treat the pain, rather than the cause. Take care, Annette""I would be more concerned about why you keep having fractures in your spine, did they give you a reason? You went in one day and discovered your tail bone was broken, then you saw the new doctor and he palpated your spine, looked at the films and thought you had a fracture at L5? You don<APO>t mention any trauma at all, what<APO>s up? Just call the doctor<APO>s office and explain about the RX problem and ask when you can exchange the MS RX for one with the right amounts, starting on the right day. If he just made a math error or got the days mixed up, he shouldn<APO>t get mad at you. You have only seen this doctor one time, and he probably has 300-350 patients, I would be surprised if he remembered you. Be patient and after you see him a few times, he will probably start remembering you. It is always hard to start over with a new doctor. Swank suggested you keep seeing and paying for your old doctor and that is one option. But with HMOs, they often will not pay for meds or tests ordered by doctors outside their group, so don<APO>t do anything without asking them first, so you know what you have to pay out of pocket. All HMOs are different, and Kaiser is the mother of all HMOs in the US. Most people I know with Kaiser really like it. My mom had it for years and had no complaints at all. I went to all her doctor appts. with her after she was diagnosed with cancer, and I have to say I had NO problems with how they did things throughout her terminal illness. One job I had offered an HMO or a PPO. About half the people in the HMO thought it was great and half hated it. Take care, Annette""Hi, Beth I guess checking with the DEA would get you the correct information. It sounds like at best the PA in your office is confused. I have heard the same thing is applicable in various states like Washington, like Lorraine said. I think asking for where the PA got her/his information might be a good idea..... Take care, Annette""Hi, If you carry a wallet, move it to a front pocket instead of a back pocket. Sitting on it can cause problems that cause pain. I am sorry you are having so muck pain. Take care, Annette""Erythema Nodosum is an autoimmune disease, I think a rheumatologist would be the specialist that would be appropriate for EN. A pain specialist might be the one to see at this point though. I am not certain there is anything to do at this point other than treat the pain, so your pcp<APO>s office may be right. There are pain management techniques for you to try though. If your current meds aren<APO>t doing it for you, they should try different ones until you find the ones that work. Take care, Annette""Ditto!! I totally agree with caspertab on this one. When I could no longer volunteer for as long as I wished, I changed to a hour a week at our local animal shelter taking dogs who were in the adoption kennel outside to go potty. Some weeks I am so sure I won<APO>t make it, but it is only for a short time, and I do it anyway. They adore us, both the dogs and the paid staff!!! Your mom might be able to call other shut ins from her home and check on them once a day on the phone. A parish nurse once told me about that. That is always a good way to get started in volunteering. My community has a line you can call and sign up for one time opportunities or once a month-week-day. Whatever your time allows for. As long as she is honest about her abilities she should do fine. Take care, Annette""Great advice, but it wasn<APO>t my poll. I only agreed about the volunteering. Take care, Annette""Like Dave said, call your doctor. Be sure and tell him that the symptoms feel the same to you as when you had C-Dif a few months ago, ask for whatever tests there are available to rule this out first off. I know this does not make you feel any better, but it is not uncommon to have a hard time diagnosing this problem the first time around. A close friend of mine had it also. Take care, Annette""I am glad to hear your father has experienced some improvement, that shows he is on the right road. Some of the area around the scaphoid bone you mentioned has minimal vascularization so healing may take longer than it would if the fracture was eslewhere. The better the blood flow the faster the healing. I am glad to have been any help at all. Take care, Annette""I am so glad to hear he is doing so much better. Thanks for posting back so I know what happened. Neuralgia is a fancy word for nerve pain. I don<APO>t know what kind of meds he is taking for this kind of pain, but many of them can be taken indefinitely if needed. Take care, Annette""Pain can continue for way more than three or four days with a fracture. There are also different kinds of fractures in the wrist, so it would also depend on what kind of fracture he sustained. Is he keeping his hand elevated above the level of his heart most of the time? This is the main reason I have seen in the past for people to continue to have pain after a fracture that is unrelieved with meds. This is not done with a sling, not high enough. He might try sitting on the couch with his arm up on the top of the back cushion next to him, or lay down flat with his arm elevated on pillows so it is positioned above the level of his heart. As long as his hand is not swollen around the cast, I would just keep seeing the doctor as required. it sounds like the dorthopedic doctor did the right thing by xraying him again to check things. Take care, Annette""I suspect Ragesh was referring to a plaster of Paris splint that is put on with an ace bandage to immobilize the wrist, but allow room for it to swell. A week or two later, after the danger of swelling is past, a cast is put on that goes all the way around the hand/wrist to totally immobilize it until it heals. Either a plaster cast or a fiberglass cast will work just fine, they both have their pros and cons. Plaster of course being cheaper. You are right though fiberglass is the norm here for the final cast. But, a plaster splint with an ace bandage is the usual for the initial immobilization immediately after the injury. Always good to see you. Take care, Annette""Thank you for your military service. I totally agree with your comments about the advocacy part of the American Legion and VFW. I feel that it is very worth it to seek these people out. My son is a Marine vet and they really helped him, he has a 90% disability rating, thanks in large part to their help when he got out and since then. Take care, Annette""Thank you for your service in the Marine Corps. My son also served eight years in the Marines, he went to Afghanistan, and then to Iraq twice. It is tough. He has a 90% disability rating, and works full time as a civilian. It is great that you were able to come off of all your other chronic pain meds, except the percocet 10/325s. How many do you take each day? Are other choices of medications better for you long term? What has your doctor suggested as alternatives? I assume your latest doctor saw your medical records and made a judgement from those. Has the VA in your area told the doctors to prescribe less opioids? Sit down and have a long talk with her, ask her where she has gotten her info about your case, and ask to see it personally. Medical records errors do happen occasionally. Being on any opioid for the rest of your life when you are only 27 is something to really think about. If it is the only choice for you, tell her that. Let her know why you are opting for that, and what activities you are able to do on the medication, that you cannot do without the medication. Best of luck, Annette""Thanks for your help with this problem. You have been busy as a bee finding resources for this poster. I know my son was really lucky to get a good advocate for his disability rating and hospital care, Take care of yourself too. Annette""I would personally find a doctor that I felt comfortable with before I decided to move for sure. Just like finding a job before moving back when I was working. This way you can iron out things like as needed medications before you move. Take care, Annette""Getting extra RXs to take with you is a good idea. Make sure you can fill them in the new state before you go. My doctor gives me three RXs for each opioid I take. I only see her every three months. Works out well for me. Take care, Annette""Remember that your spine towards the head level carries less weight than the spine at the lower back level. Surgery often works better in the neck, I have had it also. That said, I had it because I was dropping small items, the nerves in my hand were compromised. Spinal surgery of any kind is not always a positive thing to control pain. Charles has the actual studies, but I think I recall reading somewhere around 50% of people who have surgery are also successful in bring pain levels down about 50%. Not necessarily gone though. Get all your treatment options before you have surgery again. Ask the doctor for treatment options, he is supposed to give them to you before surgery, but not all neurosurgeons do. Get several opinions from well respected doctors in your area. Surgeons and neurologists too. Take care, Annette""Best of luck to you. I hope you figure things out and feel better soon. Take care, Annette""I Googled it. There is lots of info available. It is not used in the US. Take care, Annette""I agree that back surgery for chronic pain is iffy at best, I don<APO>t think I would ever do it for pain alone. That said, since I know I don<APO>t want surgery of any kind including implanted medicine pumps or the SCS I would look for a non-interventionist pain management specialist. I have found there are two kinds of pain management doctors, the interventionist that does injections and implants and other invasive procedures, and doctors that do those things but also use PT, OT, acupuncture, massage, oral meds including opiates if necessary, TENS units, and other treatments as well. I would ask before I even made an appt. what kind of services they provide, if they only do interventions like injections and procedures, I would look elsewhere. I personally think that interventionists are mainly in it for the money because insurance companies pay better for these kind of things than they do for monthly office visits. That is just my opinion. But, they are also just doing what they were trained to do, often they don<APO>t have the education to do more complicated multimodality therapy. It is kind of like the difference between seeing a neurologist or a neurosurgeon, one does not do surgery, they other one does. Take care, Annette""Actually, I did yard work yesterday and housework today so I am a bit stove up. A couple of days and I will be just fine. I have found if I stretch out the things that cause pain, it just stretches out the length of time I have pain. Thank goodness my doctor and I have a plan for when pain rears its ugly head, lol. I had spinal surgery in 1992 when I was losing function in my dominant hand, dropping things, etc. I stated in my post that I wouldn<APO>t have it done for PAIN alone, that is my decision based on my disc problems and the opinions of my doctors including the excellent neurosurgeon who did my surgery. From what I have read since, surgery on the spine still is not a great possibility for a cure if you are treating pain alone. I threw a clot after the last spinal surgery and spent six months on coumadin, not fun. I feel that for me pain alone can be treated with meds and other non-invasive treatments. A functional deficit is another thing and I would consider surgery at least for that. I think I was pretty clear in my post that this was based on my experiences and was my option for ME. Everyone is free to do what they think is best for them, based on their experience and their health issues. How is your implanted pain pump working out for you now that you have had a little while to get used to it? I hope it is all you hoped it would be. Take care, Annette""Sorry, but I don<APO>t live out there so I can<APO>t suggest names. I would suggest getting on ALL waiting lists possible. If it takes six months, then you will be better of six months from now if you have not found a good doctor by then. I would also ask to be put on a cancellation list, so if someone else cancels, they will call and offer you the appt. My husband got an appt. with a new doctor in 3 days instead of 3 months that way. Take care, Annette""Please start a new discussion, this was added on to a post that was 2 years old. Take care, Annette""I may agree with you on some points, but you lost me when you referred to ""socialized medicine run by insurance companies"". We do not have socialized medicine in the US, when you have that the government would take the place of the insurance companies. That would save us about 30% of the total cost of medical care in the US according to one article I read in the news the other day. If I need more than the allotted time for a usual office visit with my doctor I simply tell the scheduling person when I make the appt. and she schedules me according to what I need. I agree about the neurosurgeon, anyone doing surgery on my spine will be a neurosurgeon. If you are a present or former Marine, I think you for your military service. My son was in the Marines for eight years, including three deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq. It take a lot of personal sacrifice to be a Marine. It takes a long time to get used to being at home also. By the way, it is kind of hard to believe the ""God bless"" when it is followed by ""Sniper"".....strange..... Take care, Annette""Hi, Stuart7491, My husband served with Ollie North, he has nothing really nice to say about him, lol. My son was an active duty Marine for 8 years, did ship searches, then the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq, then the occupation of Iraq. Three combat deployments is enough, don<APO>t know how you did it. Thank you for your service. Take care, Annette""Has your mom seen a neurologist yet? They are seizure specialists, they take care of the brain and nervous system. If they do an EEG and it shows no seizure activity then the doctor should figure out what IS going on and refer her to the correct kind of doctor. I am an old nurse, and have never seen anyone have seizures and be awake and talking to you. I have always seen some kind of mental absence during and right after the seizure. A neurologist would know if there are any types of seizures that would sound like what your mom is going through. She is lucky to have you to look out for her. Take care, Annette""What do you mean by high blood pressure? What are your readings? True high blood pressure can be dangerous if untreated. Readings higher than 140/90 are considered high blood pressure. That would be if either number were higher not necessarily both numbers. It isn<APO>t how much stress one has that injures ones health, it is how one deals with the stress in ones life. You really should not expect much reaction to a phone call if you haven<APO>t even seen the doctor for a year. He probably thought everything was okay once you quit going in to see him. If it isn<APO>t important enough to you to take time, and go see your doctor, he will probably not think it is a big deal. I would find a new doctor, perhaps an Internist, and establish a new doctor/patient relationship. Talk to your family and friends and get recommendations regarding doctors. Take your records from the old doctor and tell the new doctor just how you are doing. Let him know this problem has been ongoing and that you have just been putting up with it because you felt you were out of options. Be sure to tell him about your blood pressure too. Take care, Annette""I wouldn<APO>t see a chiro without an MD diagnosing me first and telling me it is safe to have chiropractic treatments. And NEVER on my neck. I have known people who stroked due to adjustments on the neck. Take care, Annette""What you say is true of many doctors, not mine thank God. If I were anxious for days before seeing a doctor, I would have to ask myself if it is me or the doctor, or both. Then try and fix it. However, I agree with your doctor that changing our thinking does help a lot. Focusing on pain all the time makes it worse. Try some cognitive behavioural therapy, or at least try writing in a journal, get all of the bad stuff out of your mind by writing it down, then move on and think more positive stuff. Take care, Annette""I tried to look this up for you, but it is not in any of my drug books with that spelling. Could the spelling be different? If you try Google you might find out why they have stopped making it. Take care, Anentte""Talk to your doctor before you change anything. Itching due to meds often goes away on its own. I had itching to some extent for several months after I started on opiates. It was not all the time, I either scratched or took a benadryl type antihistamine. It finally went away. Take care, Annette""I agree with Beth that a glass of wine at night probably won<APO>t hurt, but it is easy to get into the habit of refilling that glass. I find it best to just not have alcohol in the house at all. My friends know I don<APO>t usually have it and they don<APO>t care. If it is affecting your liver, of course it is better to give it up altogether. Please don<APO>t forget that medications containing acetaminophen are also hard on the liver. Take care, Annette""I also take neurontin, 800 mg. once a day in the evening. It works fine that way. I was scared of the sedation like side effects, so my doctor prescribed it all in one dose, once a day. She has had other patients who use it that way with good results. I think you just need to try different things during the day to see what works without causing sleepiness. Take care, Annette""Many of the anti-seizure meds help with these kinds of things. Tegratol is one of them. Both FMS and TN are neurological problems, please don<APO>t get hung up on taking a med for one diagnosis, it might work for more than one. You will be the lucky one!!! Take care, Annette""Be ready to tell the doctor what activities you would like to do but cannot due to pain or an increase in pain. Be very specific. My doctor prefers me to be more active and is willing to deal with increased use of pain meds during those times. Everyone is different. Take care, Annette""Gaining and losing weight has not made any difference in my FMS. 50 pounds would have, if it was going to. That said, I feel better when I am lighter in weight. It is a mental thing, more than anything else. This time, I have lost weight very slowly and steadily rather than quickly. I can do more than I felt able to do when I was heavier. But, it has not changed my pain levels at all. Oh well.... I also take meds for my pain in addition to exercise, and other things. It is only one of my tools. Take care, Annette""Can you only use this diet for 17 days? What then? Take care, Annette""If the acupuncture works for you, keep at it! Try anything and everything that gives you even a bit of relief. Take care, Annette""Thank you for your military service. Why do all vets hate it so much when told something is ""all in my head."" I don<APO>t know you at all, but maybe it is???? Maybe not??? I would seek out several opinions from qualified neurologists with spinal expertise. See what they say. Compare their opinions, and make your own. But be open to all their opinions. Also, talk to whatever other specialists are available to you, make a place for their opinions too. You cannot go to war, or even be trained to go to war, and expect that nothing in your brain will change. We are not killers in our natural state, except under extreme circumstances. But the military must basically change that so that you will protect us and your brothers in the service at once, without even thinking about it. Then when they are finished with you, they do not claim responsibility for what they have created. They train you to serve through your own pain, mind over matter. It is probably harder to get military people to accept mental health treatment than it is anyone else. It is OKAY if it is all in your head. It is also fine if it is not. Become ""medically minded"", study hard, and do your own research. You will figure this one out. Take care, Annette""I would post on the board specifically for migraines and headaches. There are lots of folks who might be able to help you. Take care, Annette""The only comment I have is that nothing cured your original problem, the meds took care of your symptoms, pain and muscle spasms, until you decided to stop taking them and try it without them. I can<APO>t comment on withdrawal symptoms, every one is so different, but I think any withdrawal is from the suboxone and flexeril at this point. You should do whatever you think is the right thing for you. What is a Mulligrub? I do understand how you feel, but I haven<APO>t heard that term before. Take care, Annette""Of course, you felt like you were the perfect candidate for epidurals, that is what your doctors told you. I am so sorry that you are feeling so bad. I don<APO>t suggest surgery or a discogram myself. But, I can<APO>t see you or your imaging studies and I am not qualified to make a diagnosis anyway. You are not alone. I have been taking low dose opioids for fifteen or twenty years now. You should research everything thoroughly, then decide for yourself what to do next. Whether you opt for surgery, more injections, or an increase in your meds, I will support you. Do not opt for laying around on your backside though. Be as active as you can, and live your life to the fullest. Take care, Annette""Have a good cry, then start working at the top of your list of things you must do, and work your way down the list. There are crutches made for use by folks who do not have the use of their hand, the weight is supported by the fore arm. If you are depressed, see a therapist to help with that. Don<APO>t be too ashamed to get help, it is really no big deal to see a mental health person. Do NOT just put this stuff aside and allow yourself to forget about it. You can do it. Take care, Annette""If the doctor wrote the RX, it will be in her handwriting, problem solved. The police check these things. 45 years ago, my ex forged my name on a check made out to me, and cashed it himself. I filed a police report, they got hand writing samples from me, and I was issued a new check. He got whatever he deserved. None of your post makes much sense. How would the doctor know exactly which pharmacy you were going to go to? Say they are the only pharmacy in town or she did know which one you would go to, why would the pharmacist return a RX to you that the doctor had canceled, but wait a few weeks to return it to you? They would file it at the pharmacy with a note saying the doctor had canceled it. If the pharmacist told you the doctor said not to fill it, then you should not have filled it. You knew the doctor had canceled it. No doctor would prescribe 90 percocet for a patient and not have noted it in the chart. Again, problem solved, it will be in your medical record. You might get arrested, I would call the police dept. first and tell them your side of the story and get it straightened out. Take care, Annette""You might try your primary care doctor. He could help you. If you feel like ""doing something stupid"" please call your local ER or hot line for mental health emergencies. Take care, Annette""You should have seen your doctor back when you had problems, but the best thing to do now is see him. Take care, Annette""I am leaving to spend some time with my son and his family down south. I know I have not been here as much as usual, now I will be off line completely for about ten days. Have a great holiday, whatever one you opt to celebrate. Definitely have a great new year. But I will be back before then. Take care, Annette""Unless you call and make an appt. to go see him he will continue to think everything is ""just peachy"". It is hard, but medicine rules out one or two things at a time, until the doctor figures things out. Some are better diagnosticians than others. Take care, Annette""Thank you, Dave, the picture is beautiful! Take care, Annette""Being on Xanax for anxiety may be preventing him from prescribing opiate for you. There was a recent study that I read that showed an increase in abuse of drugs when benzos were taken along with opiates. This re-enforced other things I had been taught about benzos and opiates. Seeing another doctor for a second opinion is a good idea, but I would try again talking with the doctor you have. Ask him again what he would suggest you try and why. By the way, calling the office on a Friday is not generally a good way to contact the doctor, I would suggest calling earlier in the week. Take care, Annette""Lorcet is hydrocodone and acetaminophen, not propoxyphene hydrochloride. It is still an overdose because of the acetaminophen, this person could easily go into liver failure. Take care, Annette""I take gabapentin, it works pretty well for neurological pain. It is not like a pain pill that you only take when you need it, you take it on a schedule, I take it once a day. After a while, you don<APO>t think it is helping unless you do NOT take it, then you realize that it is helping. Also be sure to keep your diabetes under good control. Take care, Annette""You could also have a blood clot, that would explain the sensation in your calf. Don<APO>t go to ER unless you have no other options, they should have given you a name of a doctor to follow up with when you were discharged, it might be cheaper to see him. See someone, this may not be something you can fix on your own. Take care, Annette""Did your doctor do xrays of the wrist when you saw him? There is a particular kind of fracture of a bone in the wrist that doesn<APO>t show up on xrays until about a week after the injury. I would go see an orthopedic doctor at this point since it should have healed somewhat by now. Keep it elevated above the level of your heart while you decide what to do. This alone will decrease the pain significantly if you do it all the time. It decreases the swelling and thus decreases the pain. Take care, Annette""You might just ask him how doing more xrays will help your pain??? You might also tell him exactly which daily activities you are unable to do due to pain and ask him what to do. Ask him to give you names of pain management specialists who might be able to help you more than he is. It might be time to look for a doctor in pain management in addition to the orthopedic guy you are currently seeing. Take care, Annette""MPS and FMS do not cause an elevation of the sed rate, they are not inflammatory illnesses. However, you can have one of these illnesses and still have a high sed rate from another inflammatory illness or an infection somewhere in your body. Something as minor as a dental infection can cause an elevated sed rate. You do hard physical work that can definitely cause muscular pain, I hurt just thinking about it, lol. FMS causes widespread pain both above and below the waist and on both sides of the body for at least 3 months. (You don<APO>t mention any pain below the waist.) There is also a FMS exam that involves the doctor pressing on 18 spots along your body, if you feel pain at more than 11 spots it is considered positive. These are the two main diagnostic considerations for FMS. The doctor then does a physical exam, medical history and lab work to show this pain is not caused by any other illnesses. Some doctors do MRIs or CT scans of areas that may require them to show you do not have something else going on. I have FMS. My doctor did a chemistry panel, CBC, sed rate, and also tested for Lupus, RA, HIV, hepatitis, and an abnormal thyroid level. I am a nurse and was working in the ER, that is why the doctor checked for HIV and hepatitis, that is not necessary for everyone. Later my doctor checked my Vit B12 and Vit D levels as they can cause neuropathic pain if they are too low. My tests were all normal. My understanding of MPS (which I don<APO>t have) is that the pain is in a more limited physical area, but the main symptom is the same, chronic pain. My lab manual and nursing training tells me that a blood sugar of 78 is normal. Low blood sugar must be lower than 70. Your sed rate is coming down, I would get it tested again in a month or so and see if it has returned to normal. You might also discuss with your doctor testing your Vit D level and your thyroid hormone levels with a TSH and T3, T4 to make sure they are all normal. Why are you taking prozac? For the chronic pain syndrome or for depression? Depression can also cause pain or make it worse. If you have depression it should be treated. If you don<APO>t, there may be other antidepressants that work better for chronic pain than prozac. If it is working for you, great. If it isn<APO>t and you have taken ot regularly for a month or so, tell your doctor and ask to try something else. I have FMS and found the antidepressants not to be useful for me, but the thing to remember is that we all respond differently to meds, what works for me, may not work for you, and vice versa. It is important to take ibuprofen on a set schedule to control inflammation, 800 mg. three times a day works best if taken for at least three weeks to tell if it is going to he useful. If you break it up by not always taking it, you won<APO>t get the best anti-inflammatory effect. I know it is hard to remember to take meds that are prescribed more than twice a day, it would be nice if they were all prescribed either once a day or in the am and pm. Tell your doctor that and see if there are other drugs in the same class that can be prescribed once or twice a day. Try going to www.myalgia.com for good information about FMS. It is the best I have read on line. This is all from what I have learned over the years, it is only my opinion, do not take anything you read on line as the absolute truth. We are always wrong sometimes. Always discuss everything with your doctor, do not change any part of your treatment plan because of what you read on line before discussing it with your doctor. Take care, Annette""Thank you for the kind compliment. It is always a good idea to have copies of your medical records at home in case you need them later. You can also read over them and see what he found and what he documented. I would keep seeing whichever doctor you feel most comfortable with, but it sounds to me like Dr. B who diagnosed you is doing more of the right kind of diagnostic workup. I know a diagnosis of any kind of chronic pain syndrome is scary. But it is not the end of the world. I have had FMS since around 1995 or so, and I have to say that after some major adjustments in my life, it all worked out okay. If you do have FMS, it is better to treat it early on rather than being in terrible pain for years. The outcomes on early treatment seem to be better. A very few patients with FMS recover completely, but it is better to hope for the best, and prepare for the worst. That way you are ready for whatever comes your way. The Walgreen<APO>s clinics that we have out here are fine for sore throats, and flu, but I wouldn<APO>t use them for anything chronic or serious. Just my opinion, lol. Take care, Annette""So, you do also have pain below your waist, in your lower back and hip. There are two different terms that are sometimes used interchangably even though they mean different things. Trigger points and tender points are different things. Trigger points are points where if the doctor pushes on them, you will have referred pain at a distance from the point of pressure. Like if you push on the shoulder, you may have pain down in your arm somewhere. Trigger points have nothing to do with diagnosing FMS. Tender points are the points used for the diagnosis of FMS, They are places that may not hurt at all until you apply pressure on them, then they HURT, real pain, not discomfort. There are 18 altogether, but sometimes the doctor will push on other areas also just for control points.You have must have at least 11 of the 18 be positive for an official diagnosis of FMS. Sometimes if a person has all the signs of FMS, but has fewer tender points (not none) a doctor will make a tentative diagnosis of FMS and repeat the test again later on. Many times someone who ends up with FMS will have some other chronic pain syndrome first, like back pain. The constant pain seems to trigger the development of FMS in some people. Birth control pills can cause an elevated Sed Rate according to my lab manual. You might discuss that with your doctor. From everything I have read about FMS and other kinds of chronic pain, Cymbalta is often a better choice of antidepressant for people with chronic pain than prozac. It affects two of the neurotransmitters that affect both mood and the perception of pain. Prozac only affects one. Cymbalta has some double blind studies that show it helps with chronic pain like one would have from nerve pain or FMS. Pretty much all antidepressants can affect weight. They tend to increase your appetite some so you have to make careful choices about what you decide to eat when you get hungry. This does not happen to everyone, in fact prozac caused some people to lose weight. It was hoped it could be developed as a diet pill when it first came out. That didn<APO>t happen. It is often hard to tell how much weight gain is caused by meds and how much is caused by someone eating the same, but not exercising as much, like you suggested. You may have to count calories and watch your exercise for awhile and figure that out. There are exercises for folks with FMS to do. You really do better with stretches and mild exercise with FMS than you do if you stay very sedentary. My doctor suggested I take prenatal vits because they have a good balance of B vitamins, I have done that for years. Don<APO>t know if it helps or not, but I should take a daily vit anyway, so the prenatal ones are fine. What kind of doctor are you seeing now? She sounds like she is doing everything right so far. Go visit www.mylagia.com for more info about FMS. It is not a commercial site trying to sell you stuff. The rheumatologist and the others who post articles there are all well known in the FMS research world. It is my favorite site for good FMS info. If it sounds like what you are going through, you can print out stuff and take it to your doctor to discuss. Take care, Annette""There are disagreements on the amount of rheumatoid factor present in your body that indicates you have RA. My lab manual says if your levels are below 20 IU/mL the test is considered negative. The test by rate nephelometry, meets the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology. As with all lab tests, the results must be interpreted along with your medical history and physical examination. Discuss this with your doctor. He is the best person to figure this out with you. Many people who have a negative test one time, can end up with a positive one later on in life. Take care, Annette""Thanks, Dave. Same to you. Take care, Annette""I know it is called a contract, but legally it is more of an agreement between a patient and her/his doctor. Some doctors use it indefinitely, for as long as the patient stays with the practice, some renew them yearly. Take care, Annette""Give your body a chance to heal. I would give the PT a chance to help your body, then see where you stand. Congrats!!! Take care, Annette""I still do not understand why you pay a doctor $175 a month, do you have to pay him regardless of whether you see him or not? Do you need to see him every month? Does he keep his practice informed that he only takes insurance covered cases, is it posted in his waiting room? Does he consider you medically stable now that you have settled your case? I would use the 30 days worth of meds to taper yourself off if you do not promptly find a new doctor. He does not have to keep treating you, seeing a doctor is a partnership and both parties need to be able to let go if they need to. Take care, Annette Take care, Annette""Part of my pre-operative care was a RX drug for nausea, the doctor gave me several rectal suppositories. Many years ago my son got the same thing for his post op nausea. These RXs were given to both of us before surgery, me by my surgeon (in Oregon) and my son by his anesthesiologist (in Calif.). Phenergan was the name of the drug both times. Old, cheap, and easy. My son used his after one surgery, but not the other, I filled mine, but never needed it. I had vomiting after getting IV morphine when I had surgery once, but we knew it was the morphine, the nurse gave it slower and I did much better. Who cares what causes the nausea, drugs or anxiety, fix it. Take care, Annette""In our cases, pre-operative just means we were given the RXs for the meds ahead of time. We were instructed to use them as needed after the surgery if we had nausea. My son was five years old when he had his first surgery, he had a second surgery when he was nine and just told the anesthesiologist to give ""mom the RX for the gross medicine she sticks in my butt for throwing up"". What a way with words, and at such a young age.... It is terrible being an RN with such a smart kid. Take care, Annette""First thing you should do in my mind is find a good therapist and get on a better footing mentally. You sound really depressed. Laying in bed, your grades dropping down. It is too easy to blame depression on pain. It is also far easier to treat the depression than it might be to successfully treat the pain. Trust me, you can live with pain. Then deal with the Norco. Talk to your doctor about getting off of them if that is what you decide to do. He will find a way for you to treat the pain, if you don<APO>t like your present doctor, find a new one. Take care, Annette PS- That is just my take on things, it may not be yours, and that is okay.""Gail and Charles are correct. Flu of any kind, including the new one, include coughing, upper respiratory congestion, and most of all a fever. It is nothing like FMS pain so I wouldn<APO>t worry about it. FMS NEVER causes a fever. Remember as always to WASH your hands frequently, do not touch your face, stay away from sick people, and if you do develop symptoms of a cold or flu, stay away from other people so you don<APO>t pass it on to someone else. I think all the media attention that is being given to this new kind of flu is verging on crazy. The regular old flu kills about 30,000 people a year in the US, and no one seems to care. It has already killed 13,000 people in the US this year. We have a fairly effective vaccine for that kind of flu. ""Swine"" flu has killed one person in the US this year. We all need to take heed of the usual precautions that should be taken to prevent the spread of viral illnesses, mainly wash your hands frequently. Enough of my rant for the day. Take care, Annette""Keep in touch, that is great news so far. To go from not knowing if you would ever walk again, to now is wonderful, keep up the good work. Take care, Annette""Have you seen a doctor yet? We just cannot even guess what is wrong with you. It could be just a muscle strain from coughing, or it could be something very serious. Let us know when you find out more. Take care, Annette""Sounds like good sense to me. Please see the doctor if your pain continues, if it gets worse there is always urgent care or the ER if you need them. Take care, Annette""I have never seen an MRI machine that you could do tests in while sitting up. They are made in such a way that you can only do tests laying down. MRI results cannot predict pain or physical symptoms. The MRI results can only be interpreted with a medical history and physical examination to go along with them. Your disc changes could be a cause of your pain, or they may not be a cause of your pain. I don<APO>t know what the doctor meant by saying you are not fat enough for the fentanyl patch, I am not aware of any weight minimum for use. If he is paranoid and the FDA is breathing down his neck, I would find a different doctor. However, if the FDA is REALLY breathing down his neck, then he may not be paranoid, he may be right to worry. I would still find a different doctor. Take care, Annette""I was just telling you all what my resource book said, You are right, she did not mention taking an SSRI at all. I used tramadol for many years, and stopped taking it abruptly because it did not work for me anymore, and had no withdrawal symptoms at all. My husband has taken a variety of opioids and when he did not need them anymore, he just stopped taking them. He never had any withdrawal symptoms at all. I think this is as individual as how we react to meds to begin with. Many folks report withdrawal symptoms from tramadol, and also from various antidepressants. Take care, Annette""Please, do talk to your doctor about the Ativan and Ambien taper, before you do it. Ativan is a benzo, and Ambien is not a benzo but acts like one in some ways. Going off of benzos can cause seizures!!! Take care, Annette""My handbook for advanced practice nurses does warn of increased risk of seizures when taking Tramadol with SSRIs or other drugs which lower the seizure threshold, or if you have previously had seizures. It does NOT mention an increased risk of seizures with stopping the medicine though. Especially on day ten of the withdrawal. Tramadol is not a benzo, but Grace is correct in stating that benzos like Valium, are very dangerous due to withdrawal that can include seizures. Take care, Annette""When I had a balance issue years ago, my rheumie suggested a walking stick or cane. A cane was great. My friend gave me one that a friend of hers had made, my husband cut it to fit me, gussied it up a bit with a rubber thing on the end and a leather loop to hang it up with. I hope between the cane and the TENS unit you get some much needed relief. I still have my cane, but seldom use it anymore. The balance issue left at mysteriously as it came on after several months. Take care, Annette""Hi, Beth I looked on a couple of on line drug references and a couple of books that I have and could not find morphine transdermal, is it just not sold in the US? Where did you find it? Take care of yourself. Hugs, Annette""It is probably more what kind of care you wish to continue, than what your current diagnoses are. A new doctor must feel like he can help you decide what care you might need, rather than just continue on with old care, that he may not agree is the right care. Medicine does change over time, some meds/procedures go out of use and other meds/procedures are used instead. For instance, now the use of benzos and opiates at the same time is becoming frowned upon, and the use of them together is questionable due to interactions that have been shown to happen recently in at least one study. I have been a nurse for 40 years and many drugs/procedures have come in and out of favor for various reasons. We learn more and change our practices. This can be frustrating for patients who have had no problems ( or at least not yet), they wish to stay on the same regimen, I do not blame them, they might be the lucky ones. I understand both sides of the coin. Take care, Annette""You need to discuss specific doses of your meds with your doctor. Write down all your questions and ask him at your next appt. Write down the answers so you won<APO>t forget. The amount of opioid one takes has more to do with their history and previous level of meds than the specific number of mgs. per dose. Methadone can be a fine med to use for chronic pain when used correctly. I am confused because first you say you got switched to methadone 10 mg. 2 tablets 4x a day, and stretched out your percocets and went on like that for two months. Then you say this it was ""this past month"" the doctor said you could try 8 methadone a day instead of 6, and no more percocets. Either way you have been taking the methadone at the new level for awhile already so the likelihood of overdosing from the regular dose is probably over with. As long as you take the methadone just the way he prescribes it, and he has experience in prescribing it, you should be fine. Accidental overdoses most often happen if someone takes an ""extra"" dose because they are having more pain. Methadone cannot be used that way. Take care, Annette PS - Unfortunately, not all pain responds well to opioids. If the recent increase in methadone does not help relieve your pain, you may have to re-evaluate what meds to use.""Hi, Pesky I totally agree with you about writing RXs and dispensing pain meds. Where did you find the information about the FDA regs saying ""all women need to have their Ambien dosages cut in half""? I take ambien, don<APO>t work, and give myself at least 10 hours after taking it to drive. Does it really just state ""women""? I will go visit their site as soon as I get a chance. Take care, Annette""My continuing problem is with patients who have no access to medical care, due to their financial status or lack of insurance. Free clinics in our area do not give out pain meds, poor and middle class people do not have access to pain clinics for any kind of treatment if they do not have insurance or cash. Free clinics in other areas may give out pain meds, I don<APO>t know, I have volunteered at a local one here in Oregon, pain meds were a definite no-no, even if they were indicated. Take care, Annette""I read the FDA page about zolpeidem. I was dated 1/10/13, so I think this was the article in question. It was a dosing suggestion after seeing a lot (in their opinion, 700 does not seem like a lot to me, when compared to the total number of ambien users out there) of folks having auto accidents, etc. after taking ambien. They suggested everyone, men and women, be prescribed half their dose of ambien. Women should be taking less than men anyway, because they metabolize it differently. Women do not clear it as quickly as men do and wake up in the morning with a higher blood level than men do. That happens with some drugs. Gender, or age, or race, can make a difference. I am sorry I got all upset over nothing more than a recommendation. This is yet another example of letting my emotions get in the way, before going to the source and reading what was actually said. Take care, Annette""I agree that pain meds should be given by the doctors involved in their care, not by politicians. I think the people of New York City have some say in all this, at least indirectly by who they elect to public office. I think it mainly affects people who are medicaid or uninsured people who use the ER as their main point of access to health care. The rest of us would be referred to our own doctors for post ER care, those folks have no money to pay for their own doctors. Back when I worked in the ER as an RN, many folks used the ER as their primary care doctor. Our doctors were fairly giving with vicodin and oxycodone, (short acting drugs), but never prescribed long acting drugs like Oxycontin or methadone. Guess what, nobody came in and said their high blood pressure meds had been stolen or ""fell in the toilet"" (a common complaint), this only happened with opiate type pain meds for chronic pain. Not gabapentin, or other drugs commonly prescribed for chronic pain. Who knows? I would rather err on the side of giving opiates to an addict, than not giving them out to chronic pain patients. Everyone has an opinion on this. Take care, Annette""Using the ER as one<APO>s primary care doctor IS unacceptable, but what exactly is one to do if they have symptoms that require medical attention and they do not have the money to be seen at time of service? Using the ER is their only choice. This is what we need to change. We agree 95% of the time. Take care, Annette""First, of all, this does not mention giving pain meds that are used in the ER itself, just giving out-patient meds for three days after care in the ER. Since I am unfamiliar with the dispensing/prescribing habits in NYC ERs, or any on the East coast for that matter, I should not even comment on this. In the states I have worked in in the Western US, the ER doctors wrote RXs for anything but the night shift the day of injury, so short acting pain meds were confined to two or three doses at the most, and a paper RX was giving for anything else or if the patient were discharged during the open times of the pharmacies. There were no open 24 hour pharmacies available for about five years that I lived in Reno, once they were open, it was hard to get anything besides paper RXs from the ERs. I would not wish to be anywhere where politicians decided how much pain meds we get. Thank goodness, this is Bloomberg<APO>s wish, not fact yet. The people in NYC need to decide what to do. Take care, Annette""Get well soon! I had neck surgery back in 1992, fixed my dysfunction pretty well. I kept on working for quite awhile. Take care, Annette""Day by day, and you will do just fine. Take care, Annette""I am a believer in cognitive behavioural therapy, and meditation. I am also a believer in drugs, lol. Do whatever you think is best for you. Take care, Annette""Best of luck to you, Beth. I will think good thoughts for you. You keep in touch too! Hugs, Annette""Did the ER discharge sheet tell you what doctor you should follow up with? I was bedridden except for bathroom privileges at first while I got to a proper place in my blood work. Heat, and elevation for my affected leg. Then I went back to work. It hurt, but I don<APO>t really remember how long or how bad it was. Sorry. Take care, Annette""How does one get up if one ""can<APO>t put any pressure on it""? Are you using crutches??? Talk to your doctor about all your concerns, either in person, best, or on the phone. Take care, Annette""You GI doctor will naturally only treat the Crohn<APO>s Disease or other GI problems, not pulmonary sarcoidosis. That is beyond his specialty. It sounds to me like you have decided that for you, opiates are the only answer. I don<APO>t know if that is true or not. If he is of the opinion that you don<APO>t need opiates, find a second opinion, if you feel you will never agree. You might try stating exactly what you cannot do due to the pain you have everyday. The loss of function often works better for someone that just saying I hurt all the time. Take care, Annette""My cousin<APO>s late husband had Crohn<APO>s for many years, but he never took opiates for that chronic illness. It is an auto-immune disorder and has no cure that I am aware of. Again, I would state up front, if you feel opiates are the only choice you have at this point in your life, and the doctor you do have won<APO>t give them to you, you may have to change doctors. When you say the only doctor that ""could have helped"" you was two hours away, and you are already seeing a family doctor, why cannot he give his recommendation to your family doctor? Your family doctor could have followed up with you, and done whatever needed to be done. Take care, Annette""I do not know where you live, or what rules your doctor uses. or whether you must go in twice a year due to the insurance you have or the type of meds you are on. It is my experience that different doctor<APO>s practices do things differently. My doctor prefers to see me in person every 3 months, and gives me separate RXs for Schedule II drugs, for each month that I do not see her. She writes on them when I may fill them. She has done things differently depending on where and for whom she was working. I have been seeing her for over 15 years now. I am fine with seeing her every three months. I am on strong drugs, why shouldn<APO>t she assess me in person? Ever since I have been an RN, 40 years, Schedule II drugs required a separate paper RX each month, no calls on the phone for refills, they were clearly marked ""No refills"". Schedule III drugs like Vicodin could be refilled for up to six months only, then you had to have a paper RX from the doctor. When exactly were the rules changed? What pain meds do you get 2X a year? I totally agree that the DEA does not belong in the examination room. It just has not happened to me. Take care, Annette""I have been an RN for over 40 years, and never met a doctor who was worried about the DEA, enough to want to talk about it anyway. It is generally the ones who do not ever see their patients and do not document the patients<APO> conditions, and are caught over prescribing controlled substances that have a problem with them. My doctor currently follows the same system your doctor does. My 3 RXs are dated the date they were written and she has written ""may fill after <UD><UD><UD><UD>"" on them and initialed it. Take care, Annette""Me too. How are YOU doing by the way? How is the taper going? Hugs, Annette""I so agree, the DEA website as well as the FDA site have loads of solid info. Take care, Annette""I agree with you, Pesky. I doubt this petition will get enough signatures to pass along anyway. The numbers are against them. I don<APO>t feel any threat from the DEA anyhow. I have never even met a doctor who said he was afraid of the DEA. As an RN for forty years I have not felt any of this. Take care, Annette""I assume by ""meth"" you mean methamphetamine, not methadone? Why would anyone in pain use methamphetamine? Heroin I understand but not methamphetamine. There is a huge geographical part of prescribing drugs, I lived in one state and had never heard of hydrocodone (the opiate in Vicoden) there. Tylenol with codeine was used for moderate, acute pain. I moved to the state next to my home state and Vicoden was the drug used for acute pain, always. The same was true of meds used for nausea, etc. I am a retired/disabled RN, I also have chronic pain. Take care, Annette""Does the surgeon guarantee that the surgery will eliminate your pain? What state are you in now? You can split oxycodone with a pill cutter even if it isn<APO>t scored, but not Oxycontin, the long acting type of oxycodone. I would ask for more guidance from her, myself. Ask for specific intructions on how to best taper off of this. You are not on a high dose, you may not have any problems at all. Best of luck to you. Let us know how you do with the surgery. Take care, Annette""I personally would avoid steroids like cortisone for any but the shortest time, a week or two a year maybe... Do what the doctor orders, and/or get a second opinion. I do not believe in running if that causes pain. Acute pain is your body telling you to rest and recover from your injury. Take care, Annette""What non-drug things do you do for your pain? If you cannot up your pain meds, you have to think of other things to do. Take care, Annette""I also found your post to be very confusing to read. Try posting again in proper paragraphs. I would suggest you make an appt. and go see your doctor in person for answers to any questions, write the questions down and write the answers as he gives them to you. It is difficult if not impossible to remember everything otherwise. I would not play phone tag with anyone else. If you got a letter ""right after Christmas"" and you wrote this post on January 20, the whole part about the dates you filled RXs is kind of pointless. By now, he is probably no longer your doctor and does not need to write RXs for you at all. I would concentrate on finding a new doctor. Take care, Annette""If they do not accept Medicaid, are their any doctors that do in your area? It might be the person who wrote the letter was reading off the wrong chart, it can happen. Just write them a letter with a copy of that enclosed and tell them you never said that and could they double check your chart, and send you a copy of it. Take care, Annette""Hi, Grace I have been on a number of different antidepressants over the years, no problem getting off of them, just stopped taking them. I have little memory of about three months solid though while I was on trazedone I think, I don<APO>t take any of them at all anymore, due to the memory problems. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette"I am so glad everything worked out well for you. Take good care of yourself. Annette"It apparently took awhile before the lab got the test through their system and notified your doctor, and he notified you. You know you messed up and say it will never happen again, now all you can do is wait. Maybe your doctor will take you at your word, maybe he won<APO>t. It is up to him. Not us, or even you. Take care, Annette""Seeing the doctor every 6 weeks and getting pain meds might be the right answer or you. I don<APO>t know, there may not be a cure in the works for you. Take care, Annette""If you and your PM doctor have such a ""great relationship"" why was getting off of all the pain meds for 2.5 weeks kept secret from him? Think about it. Take care, Annette""Methadone was invented by the Germans during WWII for pain management when they could not get enough morphine. I have worked with methadone as a treatment for heroin addicts back in the early 1970s, but when I was in nursing school it was added to a cocktail for pain for terminal folks. It is fairly commonly used for pain today, at least on the West Coast where I live. I started using methadone when I went on Medicare Part D, as it is VERY cheap and I could avoid going through the whole donut hole thing. It is about $25 a month if you don<APO>t have insurance, can<APO>t get any cheaper than that. I was on a generic of morphine ER before that for many years. I never accused you of being a drug addict, I didn<APO>t even think of that. I just commented about not even telling a doctor that you have a great relationship with that you were going off of opiates that you had been on for a long time. I thought like Beth that the doctor could have helped you through any withdrawals you ended up going through. There is no need to suffer like that these days. Take care, Annette""Please see my reply further down this thread. I did not assume you were doing anything wrong. I just commented on how you went about it. Take care, Annette""According to my ""Drug Information Handbook for Advanced Practice Nursing"", Loperamide is the generic for Immodium, and is an antidiarrheal. Are we talking about the same drug? Take care, Annette""I am thinking of you, Beth. Take special care of yourself. Hugs, Annette""I am not sure if the mention of my name is good or bad. I am still here, not as often as awhile back, but I still come and catch up as I can. I like Beth and respect her answers. She just wants to get all the information, before posting a response. The nice thing about a message board is you can reply to whomever you want. If you don<APO>t want to reply to, or even read long posts, you don<APO>t have to. Take care, Annette""Please discuss your problems with your doctors, do not bother with TV ads about surgery. They do not know anything about you or your medical history. I also have FMS and it very much complicates any medical history of chronic pain. Surgery could help, or could actually make your pain worse. Your BF (and you) should have thought about the stresses of a toddler before you had a baby together. I have not heard of any kind of help with normal toddlers while their mom has surgery. Check with your county (phone 211) about respite care if your child is not entirely healthy. From my point of view, your pain med doses ARE fairly high, certainly are not considered low. But it is an individual thing. We are all different. I take methadone 10 mg. three times a day, and oxycodone 20 mg. as needed for breakthrough pain, (usually twice a day). That is all the opioid-type medicine I take, and I have been taking opioids of some sort daily since 1995 or so. Is your Opana a long acting drug that you take on a schedule, or do you only take it as needed for break-though pain? Trust me, I have been in your shoes with a husband and a toddler, I discovered when we split up that I was taking care of two kids, not one. Money was a little tighter, but life was a lot better after he moved out. It was fairly easy except for the childcare. But I have since found out that it is tough for ANY mom to find decent childcare. Take care, Annette""It could also be something else, like Bell<APO>s Palsy or trigeminal neuralgia, you need to see a doctor, and let him examine you thoroughly. Once you get a real diagnosis, you will be at a starting point. Take care, Annette""Several anti-Parkinson<APO>s Disease are currently being used off label for RLS, I tried one of them, and was deathly ill, vomited every hour and lost track of time entirely. Sinemet being used in this way does not surprise me at all. Take care, Annette""I am so glad that the Mirapex is working for you, it made me sicker than a dog when I took it for RLS. I don<APO>t know what the answer is to your problems, I just wanted to tell you that I am thinking of you. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""See another doctor for a second opinion if you feel the doctor or the ER is treating you incorrectly. Take care, Annette""Foreversore, I also have FMS, and sitting in my little hot tub is the only thing that gets rid of my pain completely. Only as long as I sit there, but, hey, it is something. I have a very small SofTub, it only sits two and only if you are already well acquainted, if you get my drift... I go there every night before bed, to get rid of muscle spasms, and to relax right to the bone. That really helps me sleep for 4-6 hours. Best of luck dealing with all your doctors. Take care, Annette""GP usually stands for General Practitioner, I assumed this was what the poster meant. That is usually your primary care doctor, or family doctor. Some folks use initials or abbreviations that I don<APO>t understand at all. Take care, Annette""This is apparently not true in every state. I see my primary care doctor, an internist, and she manages my pain meds for me. I see her every three months. I do agree about following the rules though. If you sign a contract, keep a copy, and follow it to the letter. Take care, Annette""See an MD in person, not on the internet. The doctor needs to put his hands on you and really examine you and order whatever tests the two of you feel are needed to make a proper diagnosis. Take care, Annette""I am okay of course, I refuse to be anything else. I hope the battery change goes okay for you and you can continue your taper. I had minimal post op pain after my breast surgery, I would hope the battery change would go as well for you. You are my hero, you know. Hugs, Annette""Yep, two years and a few months. I was able to cut my methadone in half within a couple of weeks of the surgery. I had so much less back/shoulder pain, I did not even notice any incisional pain. Being an old night nurse, and in pain much of the time I spend in bed (I hate being in bed), I don<APO>t go to bed until early AM, around 4 AM, then I take advantage of the meds I am allowed and sleep for 5-6 hours. Doze off and on another hour or two, and get up. All of us are fairly comfortable with our own illnesses, but others scare the **** out of us. I can deal with what I have, but cannot imagine how you deal with what you have. Hugs, Annette""I have used Ambien/zolpidem for about 15 years now, nightly. I have not had any of the strange side effects, and I do not have to drive to work so it is easy to time doctor appts. etc. for at least 8-12 hours after my last dose. The half life is only 2.2 hours, from what I have read, far better for me than temazepam. But everyone is different. Temazepam is a benzo, as you know. Are you looking for something long term or just during the 90 day opiate holiday? Take good care of yourself. Hugs, Annette""I lived in the mountains once for about ten years, and the barometric pressure really effected me. I had terrible migraines that the pressure systems only made worse. I have not had any of the eating while sleeping problems with Ambien that some folks have, I eat enough anyway, lol. I would stay away from it if you had that problem on a one time basis, who knows what would happen long term. I was given Klonopin daily once, I took one dose at bedtime. I was going to my doctor<APO>s office one afternoon, and rolled my car. Fortunately no one was injured. A slight bump on the head was all I got. I stopped the Klonopin and had terrible withdrawals from it, that required medical treatment. Be very careful if you decide on the benzos, only doing them for 90 days is a good idea. As long as you are aware of everything, and you sound like you are, you<APO>ll be fine. We are all different. Take care of yourself. Hugs, Annette""All the opiates have the potential for addiction and abuse. Fentanyl is no different than the oxycodone or the morphine or the lollypops would be. The lollypops are also fentanyl, so I doubt that would be a very good idea for you. I don<APO>t understand what the difference is between a drug patch on your arm or taking pills all the time? It is important to remember that addiction is a side effect in up to 5% of the people who use opiates for pain management. This is an important thing to remember and it is important to catch this quickly and see an addiction specialist right away. Your doctor is handling this correctly from the medical stand point. Switching to another opiate, Avinza, and gradually decreasing the fentanyl is the best bet for tapering off the fentanyl without withdrawal symptoms. But, what are the odds that you will switch your abusive behavior to the other opiate you take? They are pretty high. Are you seeing anyone to treat the drug abuse? You need to add an addiction specialist to your treatment team. Addiction or drug abuse is a medical illness that needs to be treated, it does not magically go away. What other meds are you using for your pain? What non-drug treatments have you tried? Take care, Annette""Suboxone is a combination drug, it contains buprenorphine, a narcotic which contains both opiate agonist and opiate antagonist properties and naltrexone. Naltrexone is a pure opiate antagonist, and is often given as an antidote for opiate overdoses. According to my drug handbook Suboxone is indicated only for opioid dependence. Plain buprenorphine (without the naltrexone) is indicated for pain or for opioid dependence. Often once a drug is approved for one indication, it is often used for other off label uses. Discuss this and other treatments with your doctor and see what he can come up with to help you. Take care, Annette""I personally have not seen any medical literature that indicates Suboxone is safe and effective for chronic pain on a long term basis. Are there any studies of Suboxone that have been completed for chronic pain? I know I haven<APO>t seen any that indicate it is better than the older opiates that have been used for that purpose for many years. I have never seen any good studies that show any one opioid is better than another for chronic, non-malignant pain. I don<APO>t wish to be anyone<APO>s guinea pig. I tend to use tried and true meds rather than new ones with lots of promises from the drug companies about how great they are. I won<APO>t use a drug until it has been widely used for the indication I need for at least five years. I have been a nurse for 39 years and have seen many drugs come, and many drugs go by the wayside after they proved not to be as great or as safe as their makers said they were. It is hard to tell if the Suboxone was making your stomach sick and causing anxiety or if it was opioid withdrawal from the fentanyl detox. I am not clear what you mean by your abuse of the patch, I simply take your word for it that you feel like abusing it. If you can use the Avinza and oxycodone combo, they control your pain, and you do not feel any urge to abuse them, then I would stick with them. I would also talk to an addictions specialist and get clear on abuse vs. just needing relief from pain. If you have any tendencies towards abusing these very powerful drugs, you need to deal with that. Drug abuse can be a terminal illness if left untreated. It is far easier to control if treated early on in the disease process. People with a history of drug abuse can still use opioids for chronic pain, they just need a little extra help to avoid relapsing. Keep in touch. Take care, Annette""Ameritox sent me a bill for a urine screen that they wanted over $300 for. I called my doctor to verify the amount as it seemed excessive to me, they told me not to worry, they would take care of it. I never paid it and never heard from Ameritox again. I agree with you, that it is a big, money making business. Take care, Annette""If you can afford it, you can pick your own MD. If you don<APO>t have money and/or insurance you cannot even get basic care. I used to volunteer in a free clinic, folks would sit for hours to wait their turn for a volunteer MD, that they would probably never see again. The clinic did not use any pain meds other than acetaminophen, and OTC NSAIDs. No surgeries were done at this clinic. Take care, Annette PS- I hope you are truly feeling better by the time you read this.""Some places have required this of me and others have not. I also generally pick up my husband<APO>s opiates, they have never asked for proof we are married, and we even have different last names. I personally think that it is fine, it protects me if they have ID on file to double check with. The problem is few pharmacies actually do double check every time you go in. Some doctors<APO> offices are more careful about picking up RXs than others. Take care, Annette""Sorry, maybe you have me mixed up with someone else? Take care, Annette""Insurance companies usually pay only for medically necessary tests. They usually take the doctors word for it and just pay. But now there are drug screens, some insurance companies say they are not medically necessary, and some go ahead and pay them. I think we will see who has the better lobby. I have had expensive testing for drug levels turned down, and cheap ones paid for by the same insurance company. Take care, Annette""One company my doctor used charges $345, but she fixed it so I wouldn<APO>t have to pay. My insurance at the time would not cover drug testing of any kind unless it was medically necessary. They did test for the amounts of specific drugs in the urine. My doctor switched to a different employer and they do very cheap urine screens to just check for the presence of illicit drugs. It was passed on to me as about $7. The price depends on the test and the lab doing the test, and your insurance company. Take care, Annette""As long as you are using them as prescribed by your doctor they can be safely used together. Take care, Annette""My friend took them for two years exactly as prescribed and he did fine. He tapered off them after he finally was able to have surgery to fix the cause of the pain. I would never take methadone unless it was prescribed by a doctor who knew how to use it properly. It is not the kind of med where if one works, two will work better. You have to work up very slowly to the correct dose. No one should follow what they read on the internet about how to use their drugs, they should work with their doctor, and follow his directions. Take care, Annette""Both those B/P measurements are high. You should quit smoking and talk to your doctor about your B/P. Taking it at home and slightly altering your lifestyle may be enough. Your dad had blood clots in his lungs, and your mom died of COPD, you should know that smoking at all is bad for you with that family history. Also keep in mind that your little sister is more likely to smoke if her primary caregiver, you, smoke. Cutting down is good, but quitting would be better. The caffeine from the Mountain Dew, is not that big a deal. I drank Pepsi with caffeine for many years, a lot a day. I read a study that suggested it was a bladder irritant, and went to the store bought caffeine-free diet colas, and went home and tossed the ones with caffeine. I still drink the caffeine free ones, not good for me. I could tell within 24 hours due to my bladder problems going away, I never had any caffeine withdrawals. Talk to your doctors, but your risk factors right now for heart disease are not good. At least you are not overweight, I have fought that battle and am finally winning. Take care, Annette""I totally agree with Opal40, my dad quit smoking for over three years, and he said it was easy to quit that time, so he started smoking one after dinner, in a matter of weeks he was smoking three packs a day again. He died of lung cancer at 47 years of age. I still miss him. My mom also died of lung cancer but she didn<APO>t die until she was 69. She never even tried to quit smoking. I also miss her a bunch every day. I am currently 63 years old. Take care, Annette""A normal B/P is about 115/75 or something like that. Hypertension or high blood pressure is diagnosed at either number being higher than 140/80, this warrants rechecking and meds to bring it down. I suspect you might fall between those numbers at home, at rest, especially if you are anxious in the doctor<APO>s office. That means changes in your lifestyle. Take care, Annette""I would see your family MD and get his input from examining you and doing whatever tests he requires. First comes your health, worry about the legal stuff later on. Take care, Annette""Please remember that everyone is different and responds to withdrawal in a different manner. My husband has gone off of methadone and oxycodone (together) twice during our 25 years together and neither time did he have any withdrawal symptoms at all. He had told me that he withdrew from opiates when he had cancer before I knew him, and had no withdrawals. I really did not believe him, but this time I was there and he had NO withdrawals either time. I tapered him down and off myself. He had surgery and his pain was relieved one time, and he just wanted off of opiates the other time. I cut my methadone dose in half after I had breast reduction surgery and had no withdrawals at all. No increase in pain either. I had terrible withdrawal symptoms from benzos about 13 years ago. No seizures though, thank God. What doses of what drugs are you down to at this point? Beth has lots of good suggestions. Take care, Annette""Antibiotics should be given to people who have smoked a lot and may have a viral infection. This is according to the Oregon State Infectious Control Committee from several years ago. I do not know what their rationale is. I tend to agree with you, if you have a viral infection, antibiotics shouldn<APO>t help it at all. Take care, Annette""This is a great magazine, I thought I posted to this already... Thank you again, Beth. (She got me going on this magazine also.) You do not have to be a medical professional to read it. Hugs, Annette""This is a great magazine. Thank you for the subscription, Beth. It is interesting, and not too technical for the informed layperson. Hugs, Annette""My personal opinion is that you need to cut your wife off, move or lock up your meds, and just keep repeating the mantra of ""Call your doctor if you need more meds."" That is much easier said than done though. I would not mention it to your doctor though, unless you are ready to be cut off, it sounds like your pain is too great for that. Locking up your meds is a good idea anyhow, it keeps kids out of them, or adult addicts. Does she wear splints for the Carpal Tunnel, my husband did. Has she even been officially diagnosed with CPS? Maybe it is something else, she should see a hand/wrist doctor for this. I do not know her at all, but I had to evaluate and change my hobbies after I was diagnosed with chronic pain problems. I cannot quilt anymore because doing work with my head bent over makes my hands go numb. I have had neck surgery, among other things. I gave up riding horses after my neck surgery because a fall could be very dangerous for me. This is yet another reason for her to see her doctor, so he can evaluate and follow her pain conditions and her possible addiction problems. Take care, Annette""First, let me congratulate you on your pregnancy! My mom had five large, healthy babies, all the while smoking (and drinking a small amount each day). I am nearly 63 years old. I don<APO>t believe for a minute that that fact outweighs all the studies that have been done that show babies of low birth weight are due to cigarette smoking. I would think you got lucky the first time, and decide what to do this time after hearing everyone out. Talk to your doctor, do your own research on real medical websites, like Medscape. Then you and your doctor need to decide what to do. As you know Xanax is a benzo, and is suggested for short term use for anxiety, it may matter what dose you are on, how often you take it, etc. I assume because you mentioned tolerance you might have been taking a higher dose or frequency than with your last pregnancy. Once you get off of them, I would stay off and continue doing whatever you opt to do during your pregnancy instead of using them. But that is just my humble opinion. Take care, Annette""Your husband needs to discuss his pain with his doctor, not increase his meds on his own, and he should certainly not be asking you to give him your pain medicines. It is a felony in most states if you take someone elses pain meds. Not a place you guys want to end up. If his meds are not managing his pain, he may need more meds or different meds. Pain meds do not make ALL the pain go away, they should manage it enough so that he should be able to function. Take care, Annette""I agree, the best place for her is in the hospital. You need to keep your meds, all of them, LOCKED up. Only you should have the combination or the keys, but you have to wear them at all times, so a combination lock might be better. The fact that your daughter is cutting herself and taking your drugs is very worrisome. You cannot hide them where she cannot find them. She is an addict... I used to work at a place for heroin addiction back in the 70s, but addiction is addiction, I am afraid. For your younger daughter<APO>s sake, you need to consider not allowing this young adult to live with you at all in the future. Go back to court and tell the judge that you must consider your other daughter<APO>s well-being also. This is a terrible situation that you find yourself in. Take care, Annette""Sorry, but it is time to let her accept the consequences for her own behaviour. You are enabling her, if jail is a part of what she has to do to get clean, it is what it is. Finding her dead would be far worse than visiting her in jail. Take care, Annette PS, You are probably in the worst place a parent can be. It will get better.""I also assumed you were the mother too, oops. Make the phone calls, find out where you stand, use the time she is in the hospital to do this. She may hate you, but she will be alive! Better than the alternative. Take care, Annette""Call an ambulance if necessary to take her to the hospital is what I would have said had this been posted here immediately after her taking your meds. This should be followed by a call to the police dept. to report this, there is still time for this. She is 24, let her bear the results of her behavior, don<APO>t enable her. This is tough, but necessary. She is 24, not 14, so living in your house is a privilege not a right for her. You need to learn this yourself. Cutting is common, unfortunately, and a way to hide feelings or emotions that one would rather not feel. The physical pain is a release for the person doing the cutting. How old is your youngest daughter? I hope you and she are in therapy apart from your older daughter. You must protect her and keep her safe. Get a safe or some kind of locked box to keep your meds in, count them every day if necessary and write down how many are there. We should all LOCK up our medicines. For both your girls<APO> safety and all other kids you need to do this one thing. Take care, Annette""Don<APO>t even bother to read the last post I wrote. I mistakenly thought this was a new thread, oops!!!! What is yours and her living situation now? What has helped you the most? Did you get a safe for your meds? Take care, Annette""Good job!!!! Now, tell the police and her parole officer what happened, file charges. Tell her, ""You are an ADDICT, I did what a good mother should do."" Take care, Annette""You can vent here anytime!!! Please get a safe, tell the PM doctor what happened, and call the police and file a report. I am so sorry, but I truly believe that tough love is the only way to go now. Take care, Annette""Please discuss the xray results with the treating orthopedic doctor. You need to talk to someone who has examined you as well as can see the xrays. The radiologist who wrote the report only saw the xray, no patient examination, your own doctor examined you, now he has seen the xray, also. Doctors need to do both to really come to any conclusions at all. It sounds like your doctor also wants an MRI done, all good information. If it is any comfort to you, it sounds like he is doing the right things. Take care, Annette""ME too!!! Hugs, Annette""Be really glad you don<APO>t have lymphoma!!! My husband and cousin both had it, and it killed my cousin. My husband is 25 years cancer free!!!! It sounds like the original ENT doctor blew it, but who knows? It was only two-three months out of your life, not the end of your life. Lots of people end up with cancer surgeries, mastectomies, etc., and never needed them at all, because they didn<APO>t have cancer. At least all you had were the biopsies. Take care, Annette""If you feel you don<APO>t need medication for your pain at night, perhaps you only need to take a long acting pill and take it during the day. I did that for awhile, I took the generic of MS Contin once a day in the AM when I woke up. It worked well for me for about 6-8 months. I bet it would be much cheaper also. I currently take methadone, very cheap. Less than $30 a month for three times a day coverage. Talk to your doctor after checking your insurance company formulary to see what they will help you with. Be honest with your doctor about the financial end of things. Take care, Annette""This is my understanding of these three programs. In most states Medicaid is based entirely on income, not on your medical needs. If you have paid down your assets and have little to no income for your household, then you may become eligible for Medicaid. Medicaid is a state program, you usually can apply through your county health services department. The website of Social Security ssa.gov has all the info you need for applying for SSI and SSDI. They are federal insurance programs. SSDI is based on how much you have worked and paid into Social Security over the years, and you also have to prove you are unable to be gainfully employed due to a disability. If you have not worked enough to be eligible for SSDI, but you are disabled and have few assets and little household income you may be eligible for SSI. Good luck to you. Take care, Annette""Hi, Beth I really like your attitude!!! Since my son was in Afghanistan during its invasion, many years ago, I decided to never sweat the small stuff. I stopped with worrying about traffic, I just leave a bit earlier. It has carried over into many areas of my life, including dealing with chronic pain. When will you get a new battery for your SCS? Lent is a good thought. A close friend of mine did church on Ash Wednesday early in the morning, and carried her smudge of ashes humbly all day long. You carry your cross the same way she carried her ashes. I do appreciate privacy about these issues. Hugs, Annette""Are you following the doctor<APO>s prescriptions? Using a fentanyl patch only on ""bad days"" and then using it ""every 4-6 hours"" is not the proper way to use this drug and its delivery system. Take care, Annette""You need to discuss this with your doctor. The doses are vastly different for pain management and addiction. I would talk to both an addictions doctor and a pain management doctor. I take methadone for my chronic pain now, and I was an RN years ago in an opiate addictions clinic. I have been on both sides of the coin, and I can freely admit that I can<APO>t help you, please discuss these concerns with your treating doctors. Take care, Annette""Call your county health department, Goodwill, Salvation Army, Catholic Charities, etc. they may be able to lead you to a free or low cost clinic. You do need to see a doctor, no one can diagnose or treat this on line. While you work on that, keep the leg elevated above your heart to decrease the swelling and pain. Take care, Annette""Great tips for sleeping better!! I also use a pillow between my knees for good spinal alignment. I forgot to mention, my husband had a hip replaced and did really well afterwards. Got off of his cane, and worked as a truck mechanic for a couple more years before he finally retired. His hip was bad after a fall from a truck he was working on. He went a couple of years trying to get a skin wound healed from the same fall. Hip replacement is nothing like knee replacement, it is a fairly easy joint to replace. Take care, Annette""I use a 4-5 inch mattress topper of memory foam and it is wonderful. I replaced it after about 5 years, when I felt it no longer helped. It was less than $200. I would not bother with one thinner than 4 inches. Just my opinion. We have an electric mattress pad over the top of it, my husband really likes the extra heat. Take care, Annette""I would suggest you see a neurologist, a nerve doctor who does not do surgery. Or see a hand specialist, orthopedic doctor. Or both, but first the neurologist. I would ask the doctor to physically examine your hand, including skin changes, if any. Ask him also about possible neck involvement. Some discs in the neck can press on nerve roots, causing problems in the hands. Ask your family doctor if he knows any occupational therapists to help with suggestions on how to do household tasks. OTs are great for alternative ways of doing things. Take care, Annette""I am not sure exactly what you are asking for??? A friend of mine has FMS and also had back pain. A surgeon talked her into doing a microdicectomy, even though her family doctor had told her it probably wouldn<APO>t help when she had asked him about surgery before. She immediately developed pain down the nerve to her leg, that she had never had before, when she woke up from surgery it was just there. He became unavailable by phone once she got home that day, and remained so until she threatened him with her lawyer. He saw her ONE time, told her it was pre-existing pain, and not from the surgery. He told her there was nothing he could do for her and referred her back to her family doctor. She never even tried to see him again. I am not sure what kind of advice you are looking for, or just to share experiences... Didn<APO>t happen to me, I would not have had lower back surgery for that kind of problem. I also have FMS, and though I know what that pain is like, surgery does not help it. Take care, Annette""The whole discogram thing is dependent on the surgeon. I have had a cervical disc removed and a second herniated one treated medically and I have never had a discogram. I have heard that they are incredibly painful but give a doctor little real information. Take care, Annette PS - Well said, Beth.""I do remember that happening to my right arm. It seems to have mostly gone away. Do what your PM doctor suggests if you trust him otherwise. I am sorry but I believe little of what is advertised on TV. Take care, Annette""Hi, BJ Methadone is the best thing that ever happened to me. Don<APO>t tell your nosey relatives that you are even changing drugs. They do not know what you do not tell them. Best of luck moving. I liked the mention of the cremation jar, lol. Take care, Annette""Hi, BJKuehn I am on the west coast and Beth is on the east coast, my insurance company paid over $175 a month for a generic of morphine in a long acting form, I switched to methadone when I went on Medicare because it is quite cheap out here. I would say it is a bit less than $30 a month, just a bit though. I am scared to death of getting into the donut hole. It all depends on your Part D insurance company and their formulary. Using the present one, my generic meds do not require any further payment at all, but non-generic drugs are a bit pricey. I tend to stick to generics though, so it works for me. With my old company pain meds would have cost me at least $20 a month each for a copay this year, last year they were about $7-8 each per month. It is worth it to shop around every fall for the best company for you and the medicines you take. Use your computer and check out the different companies on the Medicare site. It is fairly easy, even I can do it, lol. Take care, Annette""Just tell him it makes you very uncomfortable to even discuss things with him. Have you let him come to your appts. yet? It is awkward, no doubt about it. If he is a good psychiatrist, he will respect your feelings. If he is not a good one, that kind of answers the question of if you even want him there. He is an in-law, it is not like he is even your own dad. That would make me uncomfortable (if it was my own dad), but he would never have even asked. He is long dead, bless his heart. He died when I was in nursing school. Take care, Annette""I recently called a vet group, Goodwill, and Salvation Army to pick up a couch that I wanted to donate, and NONE of them would come pick it up. I have used the vet folks before, but they lost their truck and could not afford another. The other two told me where they were located, but said they no longer picked stuff up. So, call ahead of your moving date to make arrangements. I ended up putting the couch on the sidewalk with a ""free couch"" sign on it. Someone took it, not sure who or when. I would not lie to a family member, but I would defer their questions about my health. My husband<APO>s sense of privacy extends to asking the person who is asking unwelcome questions, ""Why would you ask?"" and then walking away as the person tried to respond. I would consider that too rude myself. But he says it works for him. Take care, Annette""Glad to be that someone to ""talk"" to. We are fine, although I seem to be having a bit more pain than usual. Oh well...that<APO>s life. I am still using oral meds to cover my pain, and as long as they keep working, I will avoid the SCS. So far, so good. Best of luck to you with the move and what comes after. Take care, Annette""Congrats on selling your house. Onwards and upwards!!!! No worries, you will be fine. Congrats also on the new grandbaby!!! Take care, Annette""Yikes, rebound headaches are a migaineur<APO>s worst nightmare, at least this one<APO>s. The only cure I know for rebound headaches is to not take any drugs at all and live through it. I have heard it can take up to six weeks, but not usually. Please talk to your doctor, maybe you can consider just changing drugs??? I would not even guess, just tell him everything. Take care, Annette""I got to speak to the head research pharmacist at the company that made Imitrex about 14-15 years ago, they only had studies using it 3-4 times per month for one year, that was their long term study. The guy was appalled that I was taking it 3-4 times a week. He also sent me a study that showed Imitrex also causes rebound headaches. Talk to your doctor. My doctor studied the times of day that I took the drugs and the time of day the headaches started. He came to the conclusion that they were not rebound headaches, I was not having a headache every day though, like you are. I followed the studies back then and got on a protocol that works for me, using a couple of good old generic, cheap drugs for most of my headaches and using whatever Triptan the insurance covers only for headaches that wake me up from a dead sleep. I have not needed those for many years. The generic ones work fine most of the time. Since I am not working anymore, I can put up with occasional sedation. Please, talk to your doctor!!! Take care, Annette""Great news, Beth!! Hugs, Annette""If you are having seizures and waking up on the floor, of course, you should go to the doctor, ER or where ever. They can treat the seizures. Do you have a seizure disorder? Opioids are not famous for causing seizures when one is withdrawing, but who knows with your other medical history. Or it could be a new onset seizure disorder, that happened along with the decrease in methadone, who knows, GO TO A DOCTOR!!! Take care, Annette""Who is ""they""? The nurses, or the doctors? Do you need a larger ER, was that one associated with a small hospital? Ask them what their problem is? Tell them you are there for treatment of your seizures, not to get drugs, don<APO>t bring up the decrease in opioids again, let the doctor ask questions, and answer them truthfully. Again, do not ask for any drugs by name, let the doctor decide what treatment to use, and you can simply refuse to leave the ER. It is okay to say you are afraid you will have another seizure, and have no one to be with to prevent you from dying from drowning on your own vomit. Just stop at that point. They might call the police, but probably won<APO>t. If they threaten to, tell them fine, at least someone will be with you in case you have another seizure. Take care, Annette""All I can suggest, is that you speak up when the doctor is there, refuse to get up and leave until he does listen to you. I can<APO>t guess what he was thinking, or why he is that way. Take care, Annette""I totally agree with Beth. Any doctor who would knowingly put someone on a drug that they had had an allergic reaction to in the past is plain old nuts. Run away and report this so it happens to no one else. Take care, Annette""Good for you, myheart5. I am so glad for you. I am also an RN, like Beth, she was saying everything I would have, so I kept my big mouth shut, lol. Take care, Annette""When I have something ""valuable"" to add I do, do not feel bad, lol. Hugs, Annette""I agree with Beth, Mike. I would get off of the brand name drug and onto something that does not have the problems you are having with that one. The pharmacy may not want to stock it ahead of time, in case you don<APO>t come in and fill it there, if they could not sell it to someone else, they might get stuck with it. I use Methadone on a schedule, and oxycodone for breakthrough pain and I give the three consecutive monthly RXs to the pharmacist as soon as I get them from the doctor, (I only started with this pharmacy in January of this year), this seems to reassure them. It is a very cheap drug here however. I went to the same pharmacy for many years before that and they only failed me one time. I asked them to call my doctor and explain it to her since I had a contract with her, and needed to get it filled promptly. They did gladly. They are not a preferred provider on my present drug insurance. I also have a few spares just in case, but so far have never needed them. Don<APO>t get sarcastic about it, just try and be cooperative and treat them like you would any other necessary medicine. Ignore ""looks"", it might be your own paranoia, lol. I worked in the ER and we got lots of calls from the one all night pharmacy in town about altered RXs. My littlest grandson is nearly 7 now, and the apple of my eye. The older one is 18 and is in the Marines, the apple of my eye comment is forbidden, in relation to him of course. Such a handsome, young man in his dress blues. Beth is also a RN, she is in Conn., on the other coast. She offers great advice. Take care, Annette""Hi, Joyce I think you made a typo, I have never heard of anyone who was on ""3502mgs."" of methadone per day for pain or opioid addiction. Anyway, that is neither here nor there. I do take oxycodone for breakthrough pain, it does work just fine. I do not know what you are talking about??? It is true that you should not get ""high"" from taking opiates if your daily methadone dose is correct when treating addiction, but that is totally different. I know this because I worked at a methadone treatment place back in the 1970s where they treated heroin addiction. The daily dose was far different than using it for pain treatment though. It was also given once a day. If it was much higher, like you maybe, around 300 mg. a day, BT meds may not work well. But, I only take 10 mg. three times a day. I have been on daily opiate treatment for about 15 years. I have always been very careful about dosing. I KNOW that my BT meds do work. We also sent clients from the heroin addiction treatment facility to a regular hospital for medical treatment of various kinds, and we never had any feedback that the pain meds they gave them did not work. Take care, Annette""Hi, Mike Sorry, I misread or misunderstood what your daily dose of Opana is. I assumed you would continue to take BT pain meds as needed. In my experience that is wrong information that BT meds will no longer work. Talk to a doctor that is experienced in methadone prescribing for chronic pain. I am very happy, I wished I had changed over years ago. My BT meds work just fine. Some doctors just do not like to prescribe BT meds if a person is on long acting meds, they just increase the long acting meds until your pain is managable. I don<APO>t know if this is what her doctor told her, or what he said. I think the important thing is to do what your doctor is comfortable with, or willing to try. Take care, Annette""I have also had doctors ask, but I took it differently than you did. I tell him what conditions are being treated, and give him the name of the prescribing doctor if he has further questions. I think surgeons and anesthesiologists should know right away everything we are taking and what we are taking it for. I wasn<APO>t there so I can<APO>t judge his tone of voice or attitude like you can. We are both nurses. I assume the doctor is just doing his job, and wants to know if we truly understand our medical conditions and medicines. Surgeons are arrogant, know-it-alls for the most part, at least in my experience. They need to be, to be good at their jobs. Sometimes it has been difficult for me to separate their personal characteristics from their professional ones. I wrote a note to one who was particularly awful at work, and mailed it on a vacation to Santa Cruz. He actually responded via snail mail, and improved somewhat on the job, at least with me. Giving them the name of the doctor to talk to does usually shut them up. They wants to rag on us, not the doctor. Are you doing okay? Have you got a date for your battery installation yet? Hugs, Annette""I had no problems switching from MS Contin, generic of course, to methadone. The doctor does the calculations with the help of an online tool for just that. Then he should start you low and you very slowly titrate the dose upwards until it works for you. Methadone is a bit tricky, it works differently than other opioids. Don<APO>t mess with the dose on your own. I think I started at 5 mgs. twice a day and ended up on 10 mg. three times a day. I would start having pain again hours before the next methadone dose war due, so she changed it to every 8 hours instead of every 12 hours. The main thing is start low and work your way very slowly until you have good pain control. I still take 20 mg. of oxycodone for breakthrough pain. I take it generally about twice a day, sometimes more, sometimes less. Take care, Annette""If your current dose of Opana is 220mg. twice a day, then your DAILY dose would be 440 mg., and the equivalent DAILY dose of methadone would be 66 mg. according to the tool I use on line. Everything is figured on a daily dose. That is with NO decrease for the partial cross tolerance of opioids, that is up to the doctor you use. Everything I have read says to decrease the dose by fifty percent for partial cross tolerance, so you do not overdose. That would end up with a daily dose of about 33 mg. a day, 16 mgs. twice a day, or about 8 mg. if you take it three times a day. Naturally, I did the math in my head, so it should be double checked. I do not claim to be a math wizard, lol. I generally use a calculator, but it is not handy. I think methadone comes in 5 and 10 mg. tablets. I continued to use the same BT meds as before I went on methadone. They worked fine for me. Talk to your doctor, but the main thing with methadone is start low and go up very slowly. Do not take more than the doctor prescribes, EVER. NEVER take extra doses because you have more pain than usual. Use an experienced doctor who has used methadone in the past with other patients. Take care, Annette""A friend of mine uses them also, he was told to rinse his mouth after using inhaled corticosteroids. He has been doing that. No problems so far. Take care, Annette""Ask the doctor who will do this procedure for more information. Tell him you are there with your mom, because you are interested and need to know more. Take care, Annette""I would work on the conservative stuff first. Take care, Annette""Please put it in the heading if you wish the Board<APO>s doctor to reply. Then ask straightforward questions for him. He is not allowed to answer questions about your health, but he is allowed to give generic answers to questions that may apply to more than a few readers generally. If you ask, it seems like they would provide you with a copy of your contract with them. Same with any other papers that you signed regarding sending of medical records. If you did not authorize it, they should not send them. It did occur to me, that perhaps the person whom you talked to and told you about the new doctor, was plain wrong, and they did not in fact send your records. If you are getting ""pain meds"" from two different doctors that may have violated your contract also. Change is hard to deal with. Never mind the fact that you are in pain most of the time, and then are expected to respond in a positive manner to this upheaval in your life. Take care, Annette""I have no idea why the doctor did what he did. Methadone is an opioid, and valium is a benzo. The latest research shows there are side effects when these two families of drugs are used together or concurrently, including an increased risk of falls, abuse, and sedation. The other point is that valium and skelaxin are both muscle relaxants. I do not know how they were prescribed, or taken. Methadone has been fairly recently shown to cause Q-T interval changes in the heart<APO>s electrical system, especially in doses greater than 60 mg. per day. He may feel you need a medication change and he is not up to it, or is not willing to do it. I am not inside his head, so I don<APO>t know. I would be most concerned with a withdrawal syndrome if you are taking significantly large does of valium on a daily basis. That withdrawal can include seizures. Methadone withdrawal, while it can be unpleasant is not dangerous in otherwise healthy adults, according to the literature. Hopefully, the doctor here will give you more information. Take care, Annette""Meaningfulc1952, please read this. Yes, it is against the HIPPA laws, they are pretty careful about that. But, most people sign a form allowing the doctor to share info as needed to insurance companies to get paid, and others involved in your care. Read all the fine print on everything you signed, and if you do not want him to do this, send a letter to him saying just that, along with your name and birthday, as identifiers for your medical records. Take care, Annette""I think there must be a medium ground you can find in between being so over medicated that you just want to sleep and being horizontal 99% of the time. I truly believe that lessening the pain by doing nothing would be worse than being dead for me. But, that is me, we are all different, and I am not in your position. I have chronic pain and choose to medicate it so that I can do the things I wish to do, but not so much that I lose myself in the drugs. Can you use your time on the computer to do things that you enjoy from bed? I think a therapist might be useful to help you clarify how you wish to live your life and how to get there. I think taking small steps towards that goal is the best option for you or anyone in your position. A big change seems impossible, but making small changes is much more attainable. As you make those small changes, you will feel more in control and more powerful, then you can continue making whatever changes feel right for you. Right now, you don<APO>t sound very happy. I found the book ""Feeling Great"" by Dr. David Burns, MD to be very helpful when I became disabled and could no longer work. I tried doing nearly nothing to control my pain and it didn<APO>t work for me, I became very depressed, nearly suicidal. I used some of the techniques in this book to change how I was approaching some things in my life. The second great book I found was ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"" by Dr. Margaret A. Caudill, MD, PhD. Both of these books have worksheets that you can use to track your progress. The third thing I found very good for me was volunteer work. I have done work in our local library, a medical clinic, and now I volunteer at our local animal shelter. There is a lot of work that needs to get done, something for all of us. Even people who are stuck in their homes can call other shut-ins on the phone or email them to check up on them day to day. We all like to know that someone will check on us, that we are not forgotten. Being immobile can cause all kinds of health problems, weakness, blood clots, bed sores, etc. If you speak to your doctor, perhaps he can help you arrange some PT or OT through a home health service to help you get going. I had a neighbor who just wanted to get strong enough to fly to the next state to visit her elder sister before one of them died. With PT<APO>s help she succeeded in doing that. And with the further help of an OT (occupational therapist) she learned how to deal with living alone so she wouldn<APO>t have to give up her home and move to assisted living yet. She also had chronic pain that she had left untreated for many years. With limited pain meds and some good physical therapy she met the goals she set for her self. You can too, but first you have to figure out what you really want. A therapist maybe able to help you with that. Take care, Annette""I totally agree with Beth. I always make sure to tell my pharmacist ALL the drugs I am on, RX and OTC. Nowadays, with patients asking for better or cheaper care, they may get drugs from more than one pharmacist. I love my pharmacists, they do good things for me, including one who actually read studies for me, about my problems. I prefer one doctor to write all my RXs, but in my case that is fairly easy. Make certain ALL your doctors know about ALL your meds. Remind them every time one gets out a RX pad, or gets on the computer and prints out a RX for you. Take care, Annette""Lots of good info, please be aware that this is written for an insurance company, read the fine print at the bottom of the first page. Hugs, Annette""Of course, you should mention the ""seizures"" to the doctor! Why would you not tell him about them? Take care, Annette""It sounds like she did taper them off, she didn<APO>t stop them abruptly. If this process ended around St. Patrick<APO>s Day, you should be pretty much past any withdrawal symptoms by now. of course, your original pain will be back full force. I wouldn<APO>t blame you for feeling anxious either. If this process ended less than 7-10 days ago, then you could blame the symptoms on withdrawal. If you are off the drugs, you are no longer dependent on them. People can go many years on them and still get off of them. The good thing about all of this is your level of tolerance should be lower than when you started tapering, so you may be able to get by on lower doses if you and your doctor decide to go back to using them. Either way, it is good you are seeing a new pcp on Monday. You and she can make a plan to deal with your chronic pain. Every patient should have a care plan and the doctor should be documenting your progress or lack of it in your medical record. Your pcp may want you to see a Pain Management specialist to confirm your need for opioid treatment of your chronic pain. She may want him to handle your meds also, it depends on the pcp and her level of comfort with these kinds of drugs. Take care, Annette""It is terrible that you must wait so long, but at least now you have an endpoint. What does the surgery entail, and what kind of anesthesia is used? Please take good care of yourself. Hugs, Annette""Sounds probably worse than it is after all you have already gone through. Best of luck from me naturally. Hugs, Annette""I simply got the list from my insurance company at the time, and found a doctor in my area. Then I called and asked to speak with the RN or MA in charge and explained what my personal needs were and asked if any of the doctors in that practice would be a good match for me. When I found an RN who actually thought about it, and named a doctor that fit with me, I made an appt. This was a ""getting to know you"" appt. I chose my doctor and have stuck with her. She now has an office about 30 minutes away, but as long as I can drive I will stick with her. She is my primary care doc, and prescribes my methadone and breakthrough meds for me, along with other meds. She is an Internist. I have been with her for 15 years or thereabouts. Take care, Annette""Hi, Grace I believe I was responding to her initial post which did not say how much methadone she took. I think I also recall from another post that she has liver problems, which may further limit doctors who opt to take her. I simply shared my way of finding my doctor, she is a doll!!! Take care, Annette""Talk to his doctor and also his last nurse, basic nursing care can really help a lot. Does he have a home health nurse that you might consult with? Splinting the area with a pillow, and the proper ways to turn over in bed, and get in and out of bed help a lot with incisional pain. Take care, Annette""So far the study is in mice only, but it is exciting to know that there may be something down the road. Take care, Annette""Your sister needs to take someone with her to document what is said and done, as far as tests go for sure. It is illegal for a doctor to prescribe any drugs, even antibiotics to a patient he has not even seen. Antibiotics are not even given for viruses. This would not have happened in any ER I have worked as an RN in. Best of luck to you and your sister. Take care, Annette""Also well said. Take care, Annette""It is very hard to tell by your postings whether or not you double filled a RX, or tried to, or if you are simply a victim of the system we are all in. Any of these could be true. All I would ask is that you be honest with yourself and your doctors/nurses. If you are a victim of the system, please keep at it until you make it better, both for yourself and for those who come after you. Whatever your status, I feel for you, and hope all is better soon. Take care, Annette""Although opioid withdrawals can be very uncomfortable for most folks, depending on the dose of course, they are not considered dangerous for your basic, otherwise healthy adults. Benzos taken daily, long term, can cause seizures during withdrawal, that of course, can be dangerous due to the possibility of aspiration. Weaning or medical supervision during benzo withdrawal is necessary for this reason. Malpractice is a legal term, I would not know about that. Take care, Annette""Well said. As usual. Hugs, Annette""Go back to the surgeon that removed your gallbladder in March. You should have seen him for a followup after the surgery, and that would have been the time to tell him you were only pain free for three days. Often once the gallbladder is removed, the pain will return within a week or two. Often a small gall stone can be caught in the bit of the duct that is left behind. They can do an endoscopy procedure to check for this. This is one of the possible complications of the original surgery as I understand it. Often the stone can be removed with the endoscope. Each time the ER sees you they should have given you a discharge paper with the name and number of a doctor to followup with. This is where you would go for followup care, not back to the ER over and over. As far as the conflicting reports for cholecystitis (inflammation of the gall bladder) go, how far apart were the negative test and the surgery? Is it possible that inflammation developed during that space of time? Or is it possible that the amount of inflammation the doctor noted on direct visual examination of the gall bladder would normally be less than one can visualize with an ultrasound or other gall bladder test done non-surgically? These are questions you must ask your surgeon, only he can give you an explanation. Sometimes there is no explanation. I had severe wrist pain due to a diagnosis of deQuervain<APO>s tendonitis. After lesser treatments failed I had the surgical tendon release, the doctor did not see any signs of inflammation when he did the surgery, but the surgery cured my pain. Who knows? I was just glad to have my pain relieved. I suspect that the pains in your knees from walking up and down stairs and hills is unrelated, but you won<APO>t know until you see the doctor and figure it all out. Take care, Annette""Lots of wives help out their doctor husbands at the office and work under his license. But if she is telling patients she is a nurse, she better be able to provide documentation of that. What is an NPI number? Take care, Annette""I think it is good that the doctor took you back and has dealt with the ""nurse"" who gave you incorrect information. I would always take a third person with you to take notes. Ask again for your medical records in writing, be sure and sign the letter and it may help to include your birth date. Federal rules say you must have access to your medical records, read them carefully and initial each page so you know you have already read it. This should be what they would send on to another doctor. They may or may not include personal conversations you had with the medical assistant ""nurse"" on the telephone. Best of luck to you, you did the right thing. Take care, Annette""Me, too, of course!!!! Hugs, Annette""Keep at whatever you are doing to lose weight. It is a marathon not a sprint to quote a friend of mine. I do not know what you and the doctors have already done, I am sorry, but I am not really familiar with chronic, long term PF. Have you seen a non-interventionalist pain management doctor? Take care, Annette""I would see an infectious disease specialist first. Ask him what extra risks you would incur if you had surgery. How were you diagnosed as a carrier? In my experience, they do a nasal swab and culture it to see. My husband had multiple drug resistant staph infections and needed a hip replacement. His infections were in a chronic wound on his lower leg. I finally had my doctor do a culture on me to make sure I wasn<APO>t carrying it and reinfecting him with it. I was negative. His infectious disease doctor put in a Groshong catheter and treated him with 6 weeks of IV antibiotics, he had surgery on the blood vessels on his leg and four months after the wound finally healed, he had his hip replaced. That was six months ago and he has had no signs of infections. Most back surgery is elective, if you are a MRSA carrier and not just a Staph carrier, I would not opt to have this kind of surgery without speaking to two unrelated surgeons, and an infectious disease doctor. Many people confuse MRSA with a common Staph infection. Only a culture and sensitivity done of the bacteria will tell you if you have MRSA. I have cared for many patients who said they had MRSA, but had never been cultured and their infections were cleared up with common oral antibiotics. Do your research on this, then discuss it with your surgeon. Ask him a lot of questions. Then decide if you want to have the back surgery given whatever risk of infection you have. Ask him what his infection rate is with spinal surgery patients, if he says his patients don<APO>t get infections, run for the hills. If you opt to have surgery, research surgeons who do you type of surgery in your state, find the best one and the best hospital. Charles will probably respond with statistics of how well back surgery works, they aren<APO>t good for relieving pain, but are somewhat better for improving function. Take care, Annette""No, you will not get half the strength released over six hours instead of 12, if you cut your Oxycontins in half. Do not cut long acting time release pills in half. Talk to your doctor. Take care, Annette""Cymbalta may or may not be available in generic. My hubby used to take it for his chronic pain. It didn<APO>t really work so he stopped taking it. Lyrica is not available in generic, but gabapentin is. There is a very small molecular difference between the two, I have found that gabapentin works better for me. I have taken both. You might try switching over before you have to. The Butrans patch is also not yet available in generic form. This is what happens when you are on high priced brand named drugs, you find something that works and your insurance changes. If you go to the Medicare website they will do the comparisons for you. It sucks big time to change over once you have found a regimen that works for you. Take care, Annette""I am a believer that weight is gained or lost depending on what you put in your mouth, and the amount of exercise that one does. Calories in and calories out. If you have to eat something because a med makes you hungry, eat something good for you instead of candy or chips. Lyrica can cause increased appetite, but gabapentin ha a much lower rate of increase in weight. I had a friend who gained a huge amount of weight on an antidepressant, but she was eating like I had never seen her eat before. I probably noticed because I was not around her all the time. 2-3 dinners, and candy, and ice cream, and chips all evening long. This was not like her at all. I have lost over 50 pounds, and have taken both Lyrica and gabapentin the whole time. Where do I fit in??? Take care, Annette""Part of having chronic pain is learning to just say ""NO"", even when people you like ask you to do something nice like move a washer up two flights of stairs with a dolly, alone. He had his pain under control by then and I am sure he thought he could do this one thing. It is a life changing thing, chronic pain, you must change your ways of thinking and doing things for the rest of your life. I hope his doctor comes up with something that helps him, but I would not expect a cure or permanent relief. Good luck to you both. Take care, Annette""Listen to Beth, she is correct about this one. Take care, Annette""I have to say that Kaiser varies in quality somewhat from place to place. My mom had Kaiser in Marin County, Calif. She had and died from lung cancer. As an RN I could not have asked for better care, she was in the hospital three times for varying lengths of time, her oncologist was great. I went down and went with her for every single appt. with her doctors. Other friends and family, who use this same Kaiser area hospital system, are very happy with their treatment plans, and care. One of them has arthritis and had knee replacement surgery, etc. there. That said, a friend of mine here in Gresham, OR, was consistently put off when he had a chronic heart condition, Atrial Fib. It was several months before he got an appt. with a cardiologist after being diagnosed in the ER. I was not happy with his treatment at all. I guess it is like any system, it has good doctors and poorer ones. Take care, Annette""Good for you, quitting both smoking and drinking!!!! Congratulations!!! They are difficult addiction to stop. Have you seen your doctor? Get his opinion, but be very honest with him. Include your concerns that you may suffer from depression. He should do a proper examination, and perhaps draw some blood for testing. You are very young, but waking up in pain is abnormal at any age. Let us know what you decide to do. Take care, Annette""All ""intercostal neuralgia"" means is nerve pain between ones ribs. If you put the symptoms in a foreign language it sounds like a diagnosis. I agree with Beth that you will probably have to wait until after the baby is born to find out exactly what is going on. Are you having a repeat C-section? Why deliver at 39 weeks? Is the baby excessively large? Why not wait the full 40 weeks? You can last a couple of weeks, you have already made it for so long. Congratulations!!!! Take care, Annette""Hopefully, your BP will go down again. Keep an eye on it. Best of luck with the little one. Take care, Annette""First of all, do not let a PT try and diagnose you, they are not qualified to do so. I would be seeing a neurologist with an interest in headaches, since that is where this all seems to have started. The neck and upper back pain seems to have developed afterward from what I understand from your post. There are many meds that are specifically for headaches, perhaps once you break the headache cycle, the other pain and stiffness will also go away. Often with headaches it takes awhile to diagnose the precise type of headache and find the correct meds for it. Keeping a journal of your headaches and pain may help. Score the pain from both with a 0-10 score. 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain ever. Score it several times a day, including before and about an hour or two after you take any meds. Write down the type of med, dose etc. each time you take anything. It may be that you will need to take a scheduled medication at set times for awhile. Side effects like sedation usually go away with time as your body gets used to the meds. It may be best to start them on Friday after work when you have the weekend off to see how you react to them. I have a long history of migraines, at time they were constant for a couple of months, other times they have been under better control. I use a preventative daily and rescue meds when I get a headache. They work best if you take them as soon as the headache starts. Taking ibuprofen more than three days in a row can cause rebound or chronic daily headaches. You don<APO>t want that. That is one reason it may be better to take the meds the doctor recommends so you don<APO>t need the advil every day. I use three different rescue meds when I am having frequent headaches, and alternate them to avoid triggering rebound headaches. Take care, Annette""Get a new doctor then. 350-400 is not ""normal"" for blood sugar. It should be less than 100. Take care, Annette""I am so glad to hear that all is going well with you. You are my favorite nurse, lol. Hugs, Annette""If it works, I would stick with it. Whatever it is. If the Dilaudid works for you, why change it? Methadone is naturally long acting, so it has no letters after it denoting long or short acting. Take care, Annette""Hi, Dennis Morphine comes in immediate release form as well as long acting. Nothing I know of works as fast as an IV injection though. It is not good to keep self-injecting over and over. Take care, Annette""Not using Demerol is NOT about drug abusers. The drug itself can cause toxicity and seizures even with just one dose. This is why it has lost favor in the medical community. Morphine seems to be the pain drug of choice in the ER, at least in my geographical area. Take care, Annette""Please read my response to Feardorcha68, at the end of this thread. Take care, Annette""I am also a WebMD Health Ambassador, it is not very official at all. The do consult us a couple of times a year on a conference call, but that is about it. Take care, Annette""Toradol injections work really well for many types of pain. There is no way to guarantee they will work for you. Do you see a doctor regularly for your chronic pain issues? I have not needed to use the ER or an Urgent Care facility for about 15 years now. I have pain, but I also have a plan to deal with it. If you have the time to go on line about this problem, perhaps make an appt. and go see your regular doctor. Take care, Annette""Demerol should not be used much anymore. It can cause toxicity and seizures, even a single dose. I think it is a geographic thing, but I know that it was rarely, if ever, given at the last ER I worked in in Nevada. I worked there for nine years as an RN and can easily count on one hand the number of times I gave it. I am so glad you did not need to go anywhere and could treat it at home. Take care, Annette""Me, too. In ER it is rarely given anymore. Old MDs do occasionally give it. Everyone got it pre-op in the olden days, I remember it like you do. Hugs, Annette""Please let your doctor worry about this. Changing from one opioid to another is usually no big deal. I have done it myself, several times for short acting meds, and once for long acting ones. From MS Contin (generic) to methadone. As long as he lets you treat the pain with short-acting pills during the change over, and adjusts the dose of the long acting ones appropriately don<APO>t worry about it. All the long acting pain meds are related in some way, the only difference is if they are synthetic or not, and the doctors know about this. Drop this from your worry list. Take care, Annette""Well said, BetteK. My husband was also on methadone for awhile, he was very touchy with his breathing as he increased his dose of methadone. I called his doctor and explained to him that he was only breathing 6 times a minute. He was fine with decreasing his dose. Take care of yourself. Annette""I do agree with you about this ""class action"" lawsuit. I got really upset when a local lawyer wanted to get clients together to sue the makers of Imitrex. He said on TV that studies showed long term use caused bad adverse reactions. I called the number listed on TV to ask what studies he was taking about, I am pretty careful about drugs, took Imitrex, and had not seen them. After nearly an hour of BS (American slang) from a paralegal who clearly knew nothing about the topic at hand, and time on hold of course, I got to speak to the lawyer himself and there were no studies. He was fishing for clients. A class action suit only makes lots of $$$ for the lawyers, not the clients. If this person actually reads the DEA website, he/she will find out how many doctors ever hear from them, and what the rules really are. Hugs, Annette""BarbH64, Go and read the DEA website, it is not illegal to write three months worth of schedule II Rxs at one time, there are laws that cover post-dating RXs, making that illegal. Some doctors actually write a 90 day prescription for schedule II drugs, according to people who write here and according to the DEA itself. The DEA says this is a gray area that requires clarification. The DEA has been saying that for many years now. Who are ""they"" who won by having the formulation on the schedule II opiate changed to make it more difficult to mis-use? Only the drug companies won. They get new patents and exclusive rights to make more money. They said they were going to do that many years ago, they waited until their patents were nearly up on the old fashioned drugs. Then they did it. Drug addicts will get drugs on way or another. It is easy to find websites for the DEA and the FDA, both are government agencies, I wish everyone would read them directly. Take care, Annette""Anon<UD>57995, We should not be pissed at addicts and drug abusers. They are sick too, different from us, but still sick. We should all be concerned about them. Take care, Annette""Hi, Beth Does the DEA actually require visits every 90 days? It used to require ""regular visits"" but did not define how often they should be. I have not been to their site for awhile. I see my doctor every three months anyhow, so it really doesn<APO>t matter. I totally agree that if one life is saved, I will give urine anytime anyone asks for it. My doctor has only asked for it twice in over fifteen years. I play by the rules. Hugs, Annette""Why do they not order enough ahead of time? This is very important to you, find out so you can deal with the right person so this problem can be addressed. It is best for your care to stay with the same pharmacy when possible and to get all your drugs from the same place. In the future, please start a new post, rather than bring this stupid one forward again. OOPS! My personal feelings showed through in a very inappropriate way. Take care, Annette""I have found as a RN and as a patient both that waiting until your pain is very, very bad is the wrong way to take opiates. It is far better to take them as soon as the pain starts. You WILL take less and they will work better when taken the right way. It is hard for us to do it that way. It was really hard for me to change. A nurse friend of mine told me when I finally stopped working as a nurse, that she was glad that at least now I could take my pain meds right when the pain started. I have multiple pain conditions, including migraines and DDD and fibromyalgia. I have used opiates daily for about fifteen years now. I use methadone 20 mg. a day and Oxycodone twice a day for breakthrough pain most days, sometimes once, sometimes three times a day. I take Neurontin and have found it to be very helpful. I hope you do well on this path of ours. Take care, Annette""When you do a poll, you must offer those taking the poll the opportunity of not agreeing with you at all. As in ""NO"", I have found Wal-Mart to be very helpful, and they do not discriminate. They have had my opioid meds, and been more helpful than not filling my Rxs. See, it is better to just come out and say, what you have to say. Take care, Annette""Again Beth says it all, and very well. Do your own research, folks. READ!!! Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know why you are having so much trouble. I am a Medicare recipient under the age of 65 and I have never had and problems getting Medicare coverage. As far as getting RXs filled on Sat I have not had the trouble you have had. That pharmacy must have been burned in the past by drug abusers. I drop off my pain med Rxs when my doctor gives them to me, she gives me three at a time, every three months when I see her, that way the pharmacy knows they will sell them and they do have the inventory on hand. Take care, Annette""I use WalMart now, as I had a change in my Part D insurance as of 1/1/13. I have had no problems at all, I get both oxycodone and methadone filled there. I used to go to a different chain drug store, before then and had no problems at all. Both will hold my RXs until they are due as my doctor writes three months at a time, on separate RX forms, with a hand written do not fill before a particular date. I do make copies and give them the originals, keeping the copies until I have had all three months filled. I will say that I get my oxycodone in 5 mg. pills and take 4-5 at a time for breakthrough pain. The pharmacist told me there was a shortage of larger pills being sent to them, but that was several years ago. I have continued to get the 5 mg. pills. In all the 15 years I have been on pain meds, I have never had any problem filling them. I have been to large chain drug stores and small single store pharmacies. Why doesn<APO>t your poll have a ""NO"" vote for folks like me? Take care, Annette""Hi Beth, In the second paragraph of your post, you mentioned a pharmacy keeping the hard copy and reserving meds for someone. You said that they cannot legally do this. My pharmacy in Oregon does this routinely, and the last pharmacy I used also did this, also in Oregon. I see my doctor once every three months, and she writes out three monthly RXs, I give them to my pharmacist. She holds them until it is time to fill them. I know you are in Conn., perhaps this is a state/local law, rather than a federal one? Hugs, Annette""Try CBT again. It is not a cure all of course. it is something that I have used for many years, and expect to continue the rest of my life. It does help my response to my pain. I also suffer from insomnia and have for many years. I recite in my mind prayers and poems that I memorized as a young person. This keeps my brain occupied and helps somewhat. I still have to take drugs of course. Thanks for ""Evangaline"", ""Hiawatha"", the Nicene Creed, the Apostles<APO> Creed, and Our Father, and thanks for the teachers who made us memorize them. Take care, Annette""Hi, Dennis Read the active ingredient labels. Sominex used to be the same as benadryl, diphenhydramine. It might be cheaper to get the generic. I took diphenhydramine years before I took ambien, I ended up taking 5-6 capsules each night. My mouth was very dry, lips cracked, etc. Best of luck to you. Insomnia sucks. Take care, Annette""I take 15 mg of ambien (the generic zolpidem) every night and have for well over 15 years. I took ten mg. at bedtime until we invaded Iraq, my son was over there as a Marine, then after trying other things, the doctor increased it to 15 mg. I have read the same things as you have, but I also do not do stupid things on the ambien. I does work within 15-30 minutes, so I keep it on my nightstand. I have discovered that I must take it on an empty stomach, and that it is fairly easy to stay awake in spite of it. I use CBT for insomnia and other chronic pain issues, it is great and works well for life in general. I really do not think there is any one drug that works well for anything, you must rearrange your life to help the drugs you take, or you won<APO>t get the best possible result. The one thing I have learned is that we are all different, and react to meds and other things differently. Take care, Annette""Hi, Grace I have found that reciting old prayers or poems from my childhood, in my head of course, helps me immensely. My mantra, I guess. The prelude to ""Hiawatha"" and ""Evangeline"", the Nicene Creed, The Apostles Creed, Our Father, etc. they all work well. If you are religious any prayer will probably work, but one from your faith will probably mean more to you. My brother, who does TM fairly often, tells me he cannot empty his mind and does not believe anyone who says they can. He feels if you can control your mind you will do better though. Take care, Annette""I believe that any pain that lasts longer than three months is considered chronic pain. I have the discs of a 90 year old woman in my neck, and have had them since I was in my 40s. I had one surgery to remove one disc, when my hands would not to fine motor movement. I would not have surgery for pain or a change in sensation, only for functional changes. The steroid shot I had in my left shoulder by my internist was great, the pain has never come back in that arm. I do have Fibromyalgia, so I assume all pain will last for several months before going away. When was your last imaging test done? It might be difficult to tell spinal pain from shoulder pain, it might not be good to treat the wrong thing. Take care, Annette""See your regular doctor first, it may be a migraine, But, be prepared to see your eye doctor. Let your doctor know about the financial part of the deal. All eye pain should be evaluated by your doctor. Take care, Annette""No, you are not silly at all. Many folks need to see their own doctor for an examination. Sometimes we just get tired of telling them that. It is very supportive of you to post as often as you do. I do not come here as often as I used to, sad but true. Take care, Annette""Please go talk to your doctor about this. You should always see a doctor for new or different headaches. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know anything about it, I filled a pain med RX at Walgreens recently here in Oregon and had no trouble at all, other than the safe holding the meds was on a time lock so I had to wait less than 30 minutes for it to open. I don<APO>t understand the last sentence of your post, ""If you are on pain meds pets and Dr. are boycotting..."" What did you mean bu ""pets""? Go to another pharmacy if one is close by for your immediate needs, but be sure and report this to Walgreens boss folk so they know what is going on and how you feel about it. Take care, Annette""I personally treat my pain meds the same as if they were for high blood pressure or diabetes. I don<APO>t consider them excessive, and I have found that the pharmacists follow my lead. I have only been to Walgreen<APO>s once for pain meds, they treated us with courtesy and respect. The parking lot is hard to get in and out of, and WalMart is closer anyway. I have had no problems with them either. Grace is wonderful, very kind and sweet to everyone. Take care, Annette""I took valium back in the day for sleep. It gave me terrible nightmares, like I was going to die, except I did die in these drug induced dreams. It was the only drug I was taking back then, and I tried them out three times, all with the same bad dreams. Many drugs can cause bad dreams. I had a memory problem, still do not recall about three months at all, and an auto accident while on Klonopin (clonazepam) 15 - 20 years ago. I don<APO>t do any benzos at all anymore. I changed from morphine long acting, to methadone without problems several years ago. It sounds like things are going pretty well for you. Take care, Annette""As long as you really trust your doctor, and you are doing well, your way is fine. I am a bit of a control freak, so I do look up any drugs I am not familiar with. I changed drugs due to Medicare Part D, and the donut hole. I am terrified of ending up in that, so I go for cheap drugs, generic if possible. Some doctors suggest changing pain meds occasionally to avoid developing tolerance to the opiates. I personally think if you are doing well, don<APO>t mess with it, lol. Take care, Annette""I had it as a child, it was called ""Slap Cheek"" in those days. All I had was a painless rash, got to stay home from school though. Many childhood illnesses are far worse when had by adults. I hope you feel better soon. Take care, Annette""Aws87, I do have migraines and take meds for them, but not opioids. There was a migraine headache board here at WebMD some years ago, I would check it out and see what it up there. Maybe someone can help you out with that part of your problem. I have a Kindle Fire, and typing on that key board is vastly different, than on this old desk top I am using. Take care, Annette""Talk to your doctor, I am one of the people here who take methadone for chronic pain. There have been some cardiac side effects noted, especially at doses over 60 mg. per day. Again, talk to your doctor. Take care, Annette""I do not know what a pressurized building is either. It may be a job related thing, please explain it to the doctor and explain it to us. Take care, Annette""Tell him about any side effects you are having!!! I have been on gabapentin 800 mg. in the evening for nearly 15 years. I tried Lyrica and it was not as helpful. Gabapentin is available in generic also which I prefer, it is very cheap. I felt very ""drunk"" while increasing the dose, I went up much more slowly than you are. I only went up 300 mg. a week, once a day. My doctor said her pain patients are doing fine taking it once a day. That way you do sleep better. It helps my RLS symptoms also. I found that once I got up to 1800 mg. per day and stayed there for awhile, I could slowly decrease it and have been maintained fine on a lower dose. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Whatever works for you, is what you should do. If the Lyrica works better than the gabapentin did, use it. Let us know what happens next. Take care, Annette""Gabapentin and Lyrica are very similar drugs, both are often given for chronic pain, whatever you and your doctor thinks works best for you. I use gabapentin and find it works well for me. Dr. Maine replied about the RLS below. Take care, Annette""I am so sorry your foot is still a problem. Take care, Annette""Did you call him yesterday? Are you still having symptoms? Take care, Annette""I am glad you are feeling more positive about your dealings with your doctor and his staff. Take care, Annette""Best of luck, please let us know how it works out for you. Take care, Annette""What are you taking for your headaches? Talk to your doctor about them, opioids are seldom the answer for headaches. I know, because I do still get migraines occasionally. I hope all else is going well for you. Take care, Annette""There are many drugs available for headaches, Atenolol is just one. Unfortunately, one must try all the preventatives for 4-6 weeks on a stable dose, each to see if they work or not. It is very time consuming. Then if none of them work, one must thry them in pairs, same thing for 4-6 weeks each time. Keep a headache journal the whole time. I found that a combination of menopause and gabapentin really helped my migraines. I use various combinations of rescue meds for when I do get a headache. All are non-narcotic meds, things like reglan and aspirin, compazine, or a triptan. Atenolol is a calcium channel blocker, most often used for high blood pressure. It works sometimes, and will not drop your blood pressure down if it is normal, so don<APO>t worry about that. Take care, Annette""When having any test, to decide ahead of time whether or not to have it, I ask myself the following question- How will knowing the info provided by the test affect my treatment plan? Then I decide. I have FMS which makes pain worse, and seems to make the pain last longer than other people. I had left knee pain and severe swelling twice, about 5 years apart. The Xrays really didn<APO>t show anything. The ortho guy I saw was great. He explained what an MRI would and would not show, and answered my questions vary well. I opted not to have an MRI, even the second time around. He also felt ""watchful waiting"" was a good plan. It took three months, but the pain and swelling finally went away. It has not returned in ten years now. TALK to your ortho doctor, see what he says, maybe see a second one for another opinion. Take care, Annette""I am going to San Diego (Oceanside) for her ceremony Friday evening, also my late parent<APO>s wedding anniversary, good juju. I leave in the am on Thursday and will get home next Tuesday. She is getting her Master<APO>s degree in social work, in a couple more years she will be licensed. I am so proud of her, she has done it a class or two at a time for many years while working full time and taking care of her children, and my son. Her expertise in social work is for the Military folk, as my son is an inactive duty Marine, she and he know about this subject. No computers are in use by me while at their house, so I will see you when I get back. Take care, Annette""That is Graduating not fraduationg, not sure where that came from.

Take care, Annette""I recently saw a doctor speak on TV and he said up to 10% of ALL medical tests have either false negatives or false positives. He stated this was also specifically true of drug testing. He said most doctors use their experience and a good physical exam along with tests to come to a diagnosis. I am not surprised at all. Years ago, for my work as an RN, I had a random drug test that came back negative for hydrocodone, and klonopin, both of which I took everyday at that time. Fortunately, it was for work, so it was a good thing to get negative tests. My results at the doctor<APO>s office have always been okay. Best of luck to you, what a horrible predicament to be in. Take care, Annette""I would just tell him what kind of symptoms you are having, and that the pain meds do not seem to do the job any more. Then follow his cue as to what to do. What else are you doing to control the pain besides meds? Take care, Annette""Keep in mind that the meds they often use in anesthesia may hook up with fat cells in your body, and then gradually, slowly release into your blood stream. This is how my neurosurgeon explained it to me when I had C5-6 surgery done. I did not believe I would be able to go back to work after 6 weeks, but I did, full time with no restrictions other than not lifting above shoulder level. He also did not do surgery on spines to prevent pain, only to keep function. He said it was a 50/50 deal as far as pain went, and the risks were too great. Did you expect to be pain free after surgery? Not meeting your own expectations would be very depressing. Does your doctor recommend vit D supplementation? Take care, Annette PS, my hand came back with full use of my fingers!!!!!""My vit D was also in the lower side of the normal range, my internist suggested I take a supplement, which I have taken religously since, many years ago. I have not noticed any changes in pain or anything. I am not depressed at all. Your body will turn sunlight into Vit. D, but you need to get enough sun in the AM or afternoon/evening without sunblock. I have read it only takes 15-20 minutes once a day. Talk to your doctor about this, get more information. When I was depressed some years back my therapist suggested CBT and gave me the name of a book, which I went out and bought. It is wonderful, does your therapist use CBT at all? The fact that you are on Cymbalta, and have a therapist already is great!!! Be sure and tell her/him what is going on with you. Take care, Annette""I would assume that it would take a full year to recover from any kind of major surgery. It was so long ago, I really do not remember how long it took to recover. The scar on my neck is barely visible now, I did nothing at all to it, so special oil or lotion. I do recall having some problems swallowing for awhile, but that has gone away also. I do recall being surprised that it took so long to recover from my surgery. I was an ER nurse, rode horses, etc., and expected to get right back to everything. No PT for me, I went right back to work in the ER full time at 6 weeks. Give yourself a break already, it has only been four months since your surgery!!! Take care, Annette""Part of the problem is which coding the person in the office uses to collect $$ from the insurance company. I also have Medicare and they will pay for tests and things that are ""medically necessary"", if the person doing the coding pushes the right buttons, it will come out okay, if the person pushing the buttons, pushes different ones, it may not. The doctor has all kinds of power to change things but only if he/she knows what is going on. Talk to your doctor, let him know what is going on, he can ask the person doing the coding to try different codes. He can complain to the lab that does the test. Doctors don<APO>t often know what is going on in their financial departments. Be the squeaky wheel. Take care, Annette""Have you looked into home health care? I did it for about six months, some visits were just to do lab draws, etc. on home bound patients like you. Take care, Annette""It probably intends to weed out folks who don<APO>t really need an MRI to start out with??? For awhile everyone was asking for MRIs right off the bat. I wish doctors had the final say in what tests are required, but then the doctors would probably bend to what patients want, like they have for antibiotics. We have ended up with drug resistant bugs due in part to overuse of antibiotics. It sucks all the way around. It pays to get a really good doctor. Take care, Annette""I have only had two drug tests with my current doctor in 15 years, all on opioids of some kind. One cost over $300, I complained and the doctor did her magic and I never heard about it again. I did not pay for the test. The second one was under $20, I paid and again never heard from them again. Different types of tests will be charged differently. The first type of test that cost sooooo much, was sent out to the lab, and was to find out exactly how much of a drug was in your system, the second kind, very cheap, was just a screening test done by the MA in the office, to see if the drug was present. Both kinds are liable to have false positives or negative. I totally understand you being a bit scared of them. I agree that not all pain causing problems can be fixed, and no labs should be forced on anyone. Explain WHY the test is needed and let me decide. Did your family doctor tell you what was going on? How old did the note on the wall look to be? Maybe it was only meant to scare away drug abusers....Talk to him, everything as negotiable. Take care, Annette""Great news, Kim. When possible, I always vote for non-invasive treatments. We can all do better, nutrition-wise, and yoga can help most folks. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t do a lot of yoga, but have been bellydancing at home for a bit over 4 years. There is some yoga in the warmups. Find whatever you really like that involves movement and go to it. I use DVDs and on line stuff that I find on UTube. Little or no cost. Try going online and searching for stuff to do. I have incidentally lost nearly 75 pounds, without altering or denying myself food. Just increasing my exercise by about an hour a day. What a boost that has been. Take care, Annette""My PM doctor told me years ago that even 30 min. of walking a day, most days, was enough to make a difference. He was even into splitting it up three or four times a day. He suggested starting at a couple of minutes a day, and very slowly increasing it by a couple of more minutes once a week. Anyone who is not bedridden can do that much. A physical therapist I knew told me she told patients of hers to walk to the bathroom and back twice, instead of once, each time they need to use it to get started on an exercise plan. Start slow and increase even slower. Don<APO>t beat yourself up if you cannot do a lot at first. Take care, Annette""As a fellow pain sufferer who had to alter her activities, may I suggest you set a small timer (perhaps on your phone, watch, etc.) for whatever your time is for sitting still, then get up and move about a bit. For me it used to be every 30 minutes, now it is every 60 minutes. Make yourself do it, I paid for it when I didn<APO>t follow instructions. Ask the PT person to teach you things you can do at home on your own. I personally found PT to be a total lack of help, but I am fairly well educated in body stuff anyway. They might be very useful for you, I don<APO>t know, see how it goes. Start stretching, talk to your doctor or the PT about an exercise program, even just walking. Do something you really enjoy. Take care, Annette""It has happened twice already. You should NOT be driving until you get this straightened out. It is dangerous!!! The only way to know what has caused this is to see someone and get checked out thoroughly. Not talking with someone at work, make an appt. with a neurologist and use that time with the doctor to explain just what happened. It is unlikely that it is the meds if you have been on them a long time, but it is possible. The same thing happened to me, I got lost in a city I had lived in for many years while trying to go to my gym for a swim. I drove up and down the street it was on for about an hour. I never found it and went home. I saw my primary care doctor and he really didn<APO>t take me seriously, I looked fine to him. I waited a few weeks until I drove again, and when I did I ended up rolling my car, twice over. Luckily no one was hurt, it was just me in the car and it didn<APO>t involve another car. I swerved to avoid a rabbit that I should have just ignored and hit if that is what would have happened. I think my meds sedated me somewhat, but I will never know for sure. I totaled my car. I stopped all my meds completely and restarted them one at a time, and didn<APO>t restart some of them. I did not drive again for a couple of months. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I wasn<APO>t clear I meant ""My"" as in mine. Lidoderm Patches work for me for some kinds of chronic pain that is way beneath the surface, but when I take the patch off, my skin is not numb. Ask the doctor for a sample if he thinks it is worth trying. They are very pricey, but I cut them up in pieces, like the doctor told me to do. I do not use them for injections as I do not have shots often enough. I guess I would ask as a nurse/mom which is worse, the injections or the allergies, then go from there. Take care, Annette""I hope it is the EMLA cream too, since that is the variable that you can control. Best of luck, let us know how things go. Take care, Annette""If you as his parent feel the shot is doing well at controlling his allergies, then he should get it. He is 11 years old right? Do not make a big deal out of it. It only hurts for a few minutes. He is old enough to deal with it for the relief it gives him down the road. An injection every 2-3 weeks is not that big a deal. You have done all that you can do. Leave it alone now. See what happens, and let me know. Take care, Annette""Ditto, I am another old nurse, and agree with Beth. It is all about injecting the liquid very slowly, after getting the needle in very rapidly. That is my opinion, and other nurses used to bring their hormones and allergy meds to me to inject them with. Unfortunately, there is nothing to numb this kind of discomfort. Talk to your son<APO>s allergist (or his nurse), (s)he would know about the new stuff better than I would. Take care, Annette""Best of luck with your little one and his injections. Please do let us know how it goes. My understanding of the EMLA cream is that it only anesthetizes the skin, not the tissue underneath. My Lidoderm patches help with deep down pain, with no numbness to the skin. I guess you can<APO>t win. You might try asking him to ice the area himself, by making him a partner in his care he might feel more in control. Often that alone helps. Take care, Annette""Hi, Beth I have heard of the gene testing for certain abnormalities that cause one to be less likely to be sensitive to a particular group or family of meds. I was not aware that this was available yet, as it had many kinks to be worked out yet. We certainly are not at the point where we can decide what meds to use according to these types of tests. Maybe the doctor here knows more about this. I am sorry, I cannot provide links to any articles, like you, I always ask. I take Nursing 2013, and Neurology Now, I may have read it there. I also get regular updates from Medscape, it might have been in those. Hugs, Annette""I hope your arm is feeling better by now. If it is not, you might try calling 211 and asking about free or low cost clinics in your area. You can also Google it on your computer. I am a nurse and used to volunteer at one, they are great, and not as inconvenient as they used to be. Take care, Annette""Be sure and tell the doctor about your pain levels, he may need to adjust the dose of methadone upward to cover your pain. When I switched to methadone from MS Contin (a generic) I had to have the dosage adjusted, and had to learn to take it three times a day instead of the twice a day for the morphine, long acting, at the time I switched. I did continue to take the same BT meds with both drugs. I have not noticed a funny smell on myself, but I have noted a subtle decrease in my ability to smell, it is very small but I am fairly sure of it. Let your doctor know of this and any other change however small. It might mean something diagnostically. Take care, Annette""I find it about the same, I really think most people can take any kind of opioid, if the dose is adjusted correctly all will be well. I switched due to Medicare<APO>s donut hole. I am terrified I will end up in it. Methadone is very, very cheap. Between $20-$30 a month. Even the generic MS Contin was much more than that. Take care, and welcome to the group.""Is it 15 ml. or mg., ml. measures liquids and mgs. measures dry weights? Is it for short term use? Is it for immediate relief? Ask these and any other questions that come to mind from your doctor or your pharmacist? By the way third degree burns usually do not hurt, as the nerves have been burned away. Other lesser burns hurt more than the more severe ones. Take care, Annette""Of course it doesn<APO>t upset me, nothing that you write could do that. I just do know there is a difference between mg. and ml. and the thing about third degree burns. I am a stickler for precision, I guess. I know how if we are not precise, other people might simply repeat what they read here. Nothing scares me worse than burns, painful is not the word. It goes so far beyond that. I hope you got answers to your questions, or spoke with your doctors. Take care, Annette""You need to be more specific???? I would rather have my pain than the pain caused by untreated CRPS. Take care, Annette""Have you discussed this with your doctor? RFA stands for radio-frequency ablation, as I recall. This is very different from burning a nerve with acid. As to why one worked and one did not, I have no idea, please talk to the doctor(s) who did this and ask them. Take care, Annette""Who is actually doing the acid burn? Is the pain specialist doing it? I hope not the NP, yuck! Have you told him of your dissatisfaction with how the system works? I tried Lyrica it did not work, so I went back to gabapentin. It was available in generic so it was much cheaper. Lyrica was only available in brand name back then, is it available in generic also now? Take care, Annette""Please do independent research on medical web sites like Medscape to look for peer reviewed articles and studies before searching out a doctor who is willing to do this procedure. Take care, Annette""Is it now painful enough to try Lyrica? You don<APO>t know what side effects you will get until after YOU try it. Don<APO>t worry about what happened to other people. If you are really suggestible, ask your doctor what you need to look out for instead of reading about it online first. He should tell you the most common, and the most important (serious) side effects. Then if you do develop something after you start it, talk to your pharmacist or doctor, don<APO>t rush online to figure it out yourself. TGN is hard to get completely rid of, but you should be able to get it under control. Take care, Annette""Please see your doctor, telling us where it hurts in only part of the deal. You need a physical examination and maybe to blood tests or imaging studies done. Then the doctor puts it ALL together and makes a diagnosis. Your liver is on the right side of your abdomen. You only have one liver, and you do need it. Take care, Annette""Frankly, if you don<APO>t tell people you are on opioids, SOCIETY cannot treat you like the ""scum of the earth"". I don<APO>t discuss my health problems with anyone except my husband. Maybe I am too private. My doctor also had practice members who did not agree with her way of doing things. She warned her patients not to even ask other members of the practice for pain meds. She had emergency surgery and was not in a position to warn her patients, the guy covering for her did the same thing the doctor did that you went and saw. I don<APO>t blame him for feeling the way he does. She left the practice soon after that. Other than that one time, she has always told me about her vacations, etc. It has been over 15 years with only that one hitch, it can be done. I only see my doctor once every three months, she gives me three RXs for my two pain meds, must you actually see yours every month? 5 hours each way, or round trip? Either way it is too far to drive. My doc moved to solo practice 30 minutes away and said she would certainly understand if it was too far to travel. Most of her mobile patients went with her. Take care, Annette""Ask your gastro doc for links to show the connection, or specific articles that will tell you more about it. Unfortunately, you are the only one with side effects from the drugs so you may be the one to decide if it is just a matter of lowering the dose, or if you must get off the meds altogether. Are there other delivery systems that might not give you the adverse effects? I have not heard about dyplasia caused by pain meds, but that does not mean it is impossible. Do more research on your own. Take care, Annette""Well said. I have also been injured by a physical therapist (years ago). Take care, Annette""I had cervical spine issues, and pain down my right arm. Right after he treated me, I developed neck pain, which I had never had before. I reported him and time, heat and ice, and cervical traction, at home fixed things for me. But, I did have to go see my doctor of course. About 4 years ago, I began belly dancing along with a DVD at home for about an hour a day. It is great, I love it, and have lost over fifty pounds without changing my diet at all. Very slowly, of course. This is the right way to lose weight though. I am 62 years old, it is a very private thing, no one watches! My doctor knows of course. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know what the demands of the profession are elsewhere, but in the three states on the West Coast that I have lived in, (CA, NEV, and OR) it was required that a physical therapist have a Master<APO>s Degree, however the PT aides only needed a certificate from a community college. Talk to your PT, ask what level of education they have. Don<APO>t be shy, ask your doctor when he refers you to someone what education they have, what he expects from therapy, etc. Take care, Annette""Hi, Surgery has only a fair to middling effect om chronic pain when done on the spine. I also had cervical spine surgery many years ago. I had it for function, not for pain, so it met my expectations when the function was restored. I also switched purses, and gave up a stick shift in my car. That was harder. If the pain medicine does not work, change it or stop taking it altogether. Discuss this with your doctor. You may find that when you try to do without it, it really does help more than you think. I had to give up my horses, too dangerous if I took a fall. Quilting became a thing off the past because my hands go numb after about 10 minutes with my neck flexed. It is tough, but there are other things to do. I use CBT, that helps a lot. I also remember what my son described Afghanistan was like when we first invaded (he was in the Marines for that one). Women like me didn<APO>t get any medical care to speak off, I am lucky to live in America, and get the medical care that I do. In other words, I could be much worse off. Keeping that in mind does help me. Take care, Annette""That is my attitude exactly. Please let us know how you respond to the ""thoracic interlaminar epidural injection"". Take care, Annette""If you decide to continue to use the patch and deal with the rash you get, please talk to a wound specialist nurse. She/he maybe able to help you deal with the skin breakdown. Cortisone cream is not always a good choice for chronic use. It tends to thin the skin and cause problems of its own. The over the counter stuff is not really strong enough to do much good anyway. The RX strength should only be used for a short period of time. I have read posts from a couple of people who spray Nasonex nasal allergy spray on intact skin, let it dry completely, then apply the patch. This will often help if you are developing an allergy to the adhesive of the patch according to what they posted. They said they were told to do this by their doctors. Nasonex is available by RX only. You can develop an allergy after years of using a product without any problem, or you can develop one right away. The only thing you can really do is show your doctor what is going on and let him evaluate the rash and help you decide what to try next. Take care, Annette""Just make sure the second opinion is from a doctor who is not in the same practice as your neurosurgeon. It is ALWAYS good to get a second opinion for elective surgery, doctors are good bout this, they do understand. Take care, Annette""TJrPuffinstuff, Check on the Medicare/Social Security site, there may be age restrictions. I don<APO>t know just how it works. Take care, Annette""You are correct as usual, it is in your post. Thanks for reposting it. Take care, Annette""Taking all that prednisone and aspirin for all those years may have saved your life, now I am afraid you are paying the piper. I have not found tylenol to be very useful myself. It may be time to change meds to a long acting opioid and a short acting one for BT pain. The Norco is often used as a BT med, to only be used as needed. You should see the person your orthopedic surgeon wants you to see, he may have other options for you to try. Either in conjunction with pain meds or without them. Try whatever he suggests honestly and open mindedly. My husband used chemotherapy that included prednisone many years ago, he only has had one hip replaced due to AVN. He blames it on a fall he took off of a big truck he was working on. I just thank goodness no other bones/joints seem to be affected. Take care, Annette""I would suggest you call the orthopedist<APO>s office and have your ""in network"" insurance info in front of you and ask him what he would like you to do? Ask him what other names a physiologist might go by? Insurance is so complicated these days. Shoulder replacements are much more complicated than hips are. Have you had it yet? Take care, Annette""Best of luck, let us know how you do. Take care, Annette""Go see a doctor, and let him examine you and order appropriate imaging studies. Meanwhile I would suggest not doing anything that makes it worse. Take care, Annette""Try seeing a full range pain specialist, not just an interventional doctor. See him as a consult to start with, then decide what to do next. Surgery only cures pain about 50% of the time, if you got function back consider the surgery a success, it you were shooting for pain relief, it was a failure. I had to change my whole life when I developed chronic pain, it is difficult but not impossible. You can do it. Take care, Annette""I had a cervical discectomy many years ago, and the disc next to that one failed within a year or so. I opted not to have surgery again. 2 1/2 years ago I had breast reduction surgery and was able to cut my pain meds in half. I wish I had done it 20-30 years ago. A wonderful plastic surgeon did the surgery for me, she had me get a consult from a hematologist and from a pain management specialist first. I had had a blood clot after the discectomy, she wanted to make sure it was not a genetic problem that was likely to crop up again, it wasn<APO>t. Medicare paid for most of the surgery. Their only pre-requisite was that she take out a minimum amount of breast tissue, which she did. I paid the rest out of pocket. I was told all the costs up front before I signed the consent forms. It was a same day surgery, right around 24 hours total. Unlike other surgeries I have had, I have had no ill effects at all. Unless having to buy new bras is an ill effect, lol. They actually fit too. Best of luck with your newest surgical endeavor, Beth. Are you doing okay otherwise? Hugs, Annette""When you are ready and have finished grieving, you can do it. I have nerve pain and oral meds do help, although nothing has ever goteen rid of the pain completely. Try yet another PM doctor, not an interventionist, rather one who does it all. Take care, Annette""I would not see a doctor who only cared about the $$ and getting me in and out. Why did you let him do injections in your back if you did not have pain there? If he did the MRI only for a road map, or visual aid, to see where he was going to put the injections, that is one thing, if he was deciding treatment that is another thing entirely. Of course, he should discuss that with you, along with the MRI results. A radiologist reads the films first, they are very conservative. I would trust my doctor to take a look at them and discuss them with me. Did you ask him about the initial MRI when it was first done? Maybe he thinks you are not a person who prefers to discuss things at all, but rather prefers the doctor to make the appropriate choice for you. Talk to the doctor about all of this, then if you wish to get your records, do so by simply asking for them in writing, it is best to include your birthday as verification of your identity. The government says you have the right to them, and the doctor<APO>s office may only collect a copying fee for making a copy for you. All of that is in the HIPPA rules that you are given when you start seeing any doctor. Talk to him first. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I meant HIPAA. Take care, Annette""Treating pain from abdominal adhesions with opiates is tricky. The opiates cause constipation which can lead to a bowel obstruction if the adhesions are in the wrong place. it takes a careful balance. Do your own research at legitimate medical sites like Medscape or Medline. Find research that supports what you feel you need. Print it out and take it to her. Take care, Annette""Would you mind describing exactly what they did when they did your Bier Block? What part of the body are they treating? I am familiar with Bier Blocks done for acute injuries, like for reducing fractures and dislocations, but not for chronic pain. I am very curious. Thank you. Take care, Annette""Keep looking for other programs, do not assume she will be ineligible for all of them. Did you ask them what other programs she might be eligible for? Call them. Many, many years ago, 40 or so, I worked at a methadone program for heroin addiction and the federal rules at that time stated you must have a dirty urine test currently to get in. It was still considered an experimental drug at that time. It was very difficult to turn away people who were obviously trying hard to stay off of drugs. She should be going to NA meetings, is she? Good for her staying clean and avoiding drugged up ""friends"". Give her my best. Take care, Annette""I can understand it, but since many folks take opioids or other drugs to self-treat mental illnesses, it does make it harder to get treatment. She needs treatment for both. Does she have insurance or medicaid? Walk her through the process if you can, and help her get treatment from a psychiatrist if she can where you live. Keep trying, you are doing great, crossing things off your list at this point, but proving to your daughter that you love her. Take care, Annette""It is tough, bless you for making the right decisions. Take care of yourself, and keep us up to date on her recovery. Hugs, Annette""At Walgreens, you don<APO>t know what the form said that they asked your husband to sign, so how can we decide if it was reasonable or not. Pharmacies often change their rules. We go to Walmart now but I have used the Walgreens across the street once since January 2013 to fill my husband<APO>s RX for chronic pain, they filled it without any problems. I don<APO>t know what has happened. As long as you are getting your medicine, all is okay for now. Take care, Annette""What does your doctor say is the normal recovery rate for this problem? I suspect it takes a long time to get over, a friend of mine had it and it took her months to recover. Take care, Annette""If you had on a Holter monitor during the episode you could easily see any EKG changes, it monitors your EKG for 24 hours at a time. If you have already tried that and it was normal through an episode, your doctor might be right in saying it was anxiety. Anxiety can cause symptoms all through your body. I hope you are doing something about that triglyceride level. Talk to your doctor about taking the benedryl, like Beth suggested. Take care, Annette""If two unrelated doctors suggested you try hydrocodone, why aren<APO>t you using it? Trust me they have a lot of education between them and would never write someting down and put their names to it, if they did not believe it would be useful. Tramadol is said to be used only 400 mg. per day maximum, and you are already over that limit by 50 mg. If your current meds get you down to 1-5 on the 0-10 pain scale. switching out the tramadol for hydrocodone should make you very comfortable. Take care, Annette""Devil<APO>s claw is a herbal remedy. I am not familiar with it. Take care, Annette""He was right, they are two different problems. You probably should be seeing a heart doctor for the leaky valve/heart attack, cardiac problems and seeing a pain management doctor for the pain problems. What specialty was you old doctor that raised your meds and prescribed them for you? Your heart doctor does not think you need the pain meds or is he afraid of prescribing them for you? Talk to him and let him know what is going on. Take care, Annette""See, self diagnosing is not a really, good idea. If it doesn<APO>t hurt enough to get you to even take Motrin, yet, I would do the watchful waiting thing and put off seeing the ortho doctor too. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Follow through on your plans for a second opinion, one should always get one before having elective surgery. That way you also can choose surgeons, having met them both. Ask them for infection rates, etc. to help you decide. Take care, Annette""Sorry, but relaxation will not just happen. It is something you have to learn to do. You cannot choose the stresses in your life, but you can choose HOW you react to them. If you have a jetted tub, but opt not to use it that is a choice you are making. Buying new furniture won<APO>t fix things, or we would all be well. I strongly recommend you try cognitive behavioural therapy either with a good self hep book like ""Feeling Great"" by Dr. David Burns, MD or with a good therapist. It will help you learn to relax, and also help you deal with your depression and anxiety issues. I used it initially for depression, but also use it for coping with chronic pain. I agree with you, I would rather have something accomplished if I am going to have pain anyway. I really don<APO>t let my chronic pain keep me from doing what I am able to do. I sometimes find I hurt a bit more, but usually the pain remains about the same. I plan days of rest to recover when necessary. I also have planned meds to take when I over do things, as long as I take them according to my treatment plan, I recover well enough. This week I will be doing my yard work. I did downsize to a smaller place and a smaller yard after I became ill. It works for me. Take good care of yourself, and please keep in touch. Annette""We went from an acre and a half yard, plus another 3/4 of an acre for the horses to a small yard here. I totally get what you mean. We had a wedding at our old house shortly before we moved away. Weddings are wonderful, I hope your niece<APO>s goes well. I did my yard and also some tree trimming this afternoon. I managed to fix up my current yard so that there is a minimum of weeding, etc. that is hard on my back. Most everything is perennial and well established. A bit of mowing and pruning and I am usually done. I know about pacing and hydrating, thank goodness. Take care of yourself. Annette""We are not allowed to act like doctors and tell people what to do and when to do it. We can offer suggestion based on our own experiences. You have received two different diagnoses from two different doctors. That alone would make me think twice about suggesting therapy. Ask your own doctor your questions, it helps me to write them all down so I don<APO>t forget anything before I go see mine. Take care, Annette Take care, Annette""I have been a nurse in several ERs, no ER doctors will sign for a medical marijuana card. I have worked in two states out of three, with state medical marijuana laws saying it was okay with a card. ER doctors do not know you well enough to sign for a card. They do not make a back pain diagnosis either, they just make sure you are not in danger of dying now. Please see a family doctor to get a proper work up. What is your weight? You did state your height, but not the weight part. I only recently went from being obese to only being ""overweight"" per my BMI. It isn<APO>t like I don<APO>t get it, I do. But it is all about putting more calories into your body than you burn off. It is far better to very slowly lose weight at your age than wait until my age, I am 62 years old. I finally weigh less than I have since I was a teenager. It sounds like you are not in any condition to jump to an infant<APO>s aid right this second anyway. Be honest with yourself. Take care, Annette""Only you know the answer to ""why stick around"", what is it? Take care, Annette PS - Please call your local hotline for help, it is much better than writing long drawn out posts here.""Washington state just passed a law saying the recreational use of marijuana is no longer a crime there. Keeping in mind of course that it is a federal crime, they have not changed their minds. MJ is legal in Washington and Colorado, for everyone. Hugs, Annette""Sorry, I meant in my second sentence that it was a federal crime, even in states like Washington and Colorado where they passed state laws legalizing MJ for everyone. I apologize for not being more accurate. Take care, Annette""I live in Oregon, the first state to allow terminal patients to choose when to die. But, you have to be terminal, and diagnosed that way by the doctor prescribing the medicine. I have not heard that one pill will do the job. I suggested calling a hot line, because that is what they do, here at WebMD. My personal advice would be far different, and not allowed here at all. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""How are you doing now? Anytime one changes ones scheduled opiate pain med, one should have adequate break through pain meds. Often the transition is a bit rocky. Take care, Annette""Because this is an elective surgery, I hope you work out all your concerns BEFORE you have the surgery. Since you have already scheduled it and still have questions, I am concerned for you. I would not consider any kind of surgical intervention for my pain until ALL other types of interventions have failed, including large amounts of oral opiates. One of the people who posted here about having had a pump put in brought up a very serious point. She lost her health insurance and could no longer afford to have the pump filled or maintained at all. She had asked doctors to help her out and got no where. If you are already on Medicare or have permanent insurance for the rest of your life this may not be a concern for you. But, if you are covered on your job<APO>s insurance or your spouse<APO>s job insurance, that could go away anytime. If you become disabled and go on SSDI, you do not become eligible for Medicare until two years after your date of disability. It is possible in this country to fall between the cracks, to have too much to qualify for medicaid, and still not have enough $$ for private insurance. Many private insurance companies pick and choose who they will cover, and opt not to cover people with pre-existing conditions. The medical pros and cons of the pump I will leave up to folks who have used one. Write down all your questions and get answers from your doctor before you have this or any other surgery. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t have a specific answer as to why barometric pressure changes the perception of pain, but it does. It affects migraines a lot, and other chronic pain also for many people. For me it was not that the pressure was high or low, it was just during the hard changes in pressure that happened as storms came in when I lived in the mountains/high desert. The problem with teeth and pain meds is that a lot of pain meds cause dry mouth, dry mouth rots your teeth. You need saliva in your mouth to bathe your teeth and keep them moist. My hubby lost a lot of his teeth when he had chemo for cancer for the same reason. I am no expert on RSD, but a lot of chronic pain will feel worse during the day as you tire and feel less able to cope. Plan your days so that you can adapt to doing more during the good part of the day for you and rest more during the bad parts of the day. Short term memory can be related to meds , to chronic pain all day, or to fatigue from dealing with the aforementioned. I keep lists of things I need to do, a grocery list lives on top of my microwave so my hubby and I can write down whatever we use the last of and need to replace. I make a list of topics I need to discuss with my son when I speak to him on the phone, and cross them off as we talk. Do whatever tricks you need to do to help you remember things. My mom kept lists too, and there was nothing wrong with her memory, it just worked for her. I would also discuss the memory thing with my doctor. I like to be sure that I am not dealing with some new problem in addition to the old ones. I am sorry I don<APO>t have all the answers for your questions, I am sure someone else will pipe up if they do. Hugs, Annette""She did tell you taking so much Advil could kill you. Find out exactly what is going on in your back, and get treated for your chronic intermittent pain. That is what the medical folks would call a recurring pain that is expected to keep on causing problems. Who knows, the back pain might be from something curable or treatable. You won<APO>t know until you see a doctor about it and get a proper diagnosis. Take care, Annette""Please do not take more Ultram than the doctor prescribes, if he says taking four at a time is okay....whatever. The package insert says not to take more than 400 mg. in 24 hours. Please do not do that. I have not heard of closing up over a skin infection with sutures? I would change doctors also, unless he could convince me why what he did was a good thing to do. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Speak to a pharmacist at your local drug store, but if you are an otherwise healthy adult with no GI (stomach) issues, it should not be a problem to alternate tylenol with ibuprofen as directed on the bottle for fever. They are unrelated medicines, they work in completely different ways. I personally would not treat a fever under 101 degrees, that is up to you and your doctor. It all depends on how you feel. Remember that a fever is a symptom of illness, you still may need to treat the illness itself. See your doctor or an urgent care doctor or nurse practitioner. Take care, Annette""You really need to call her office and ask what her diagnosis was. Lots of people forget what the doctor says during an appt. It is wise to take a small pad of paper with you and write down the important stuff. Many people get nervous during an appt. especially when given a new diagnosis and just forget details. Take care, Annette""One dose probably won<APO>t hurt you, but I would let your doctor know as soon as you can, and of course avoid aspirin and ibuprofen and Aleve as long as you are taking Celebrex. The only over the counter pain med you may take with Celebrex is acetaminophen. But, please talk to your pharmacist or your doctor before trying that. Take care, Annette""Call your own orthopedic doctor and make an appt. to see him, let him examine you and tell him about the pain face to face. See what he says. It isn<APO>t really an ER issue. Take care, Annette""It is a felony to take someone else<APO>s controlled substances. It is also dangerous. If you have a signed contract with your doctor for the chronic use of opiates like many of us do, it may state that there will be no early refills for any reason. Mine dose. I never take all my meds with me anywhere, I only take with me what I will need. I have no idea why you would take a week<APO>s worth of meds to the movies with you. I do not leave my meds in the medicine cabinet in the bathroom. It is always best to keep them locked up and hidden. As you discovered when your meds were ""stolen"" from your hotel room. Call your doctor back and ask him if he will help you get through the withdrawals for the next week by using non-opiate meds and other treatments. Opiate withdrawal (not mixed with benzos) is not a dangerous process, it is just miserable to go through. Clonidine is a blood pressure med that is well known for use during opiate withdrawal to minimize the symptoms. Muscle relaxants, antidiarrheals, etc. can also help. If you are honest with him and work with him through this process you will be better able to find a new doctor if that is what you decide to do. Percocet has tylenol in it, I hope you are not taking the equivalent of 100-120 mg. of oxycodone in percocet form, that could be far too much tylenol per day depending on the formula. Take care, Annette""What is written on the bottle was written for another person and another type of pain. This is a felony in most states, and for good reasons like the ones you already mentioned. Getting booted from this doctor<APO>s practice for a positive drug test at your next visit just means you will go through withdrawals later on, and have a very difficult time getting another doctor. Take care, Annette""Like the other poster suggested, I would see a neurologist that specializes in spinal problems. Take care, Annette""Please remember that the radiologists who read your MRI never see you at all, and do not know you at all. I would ask to be referred to a specialist, take your MRI with you, and see what he says after examining you. You need both an MRI and a physical exam and a history to get any real answers. Take care, Annette""Fentanyl patches are only given to people who are already opioid dependent. I am shocked that your doctors and you are considering an implanted pain med pump or spinal cord stimulator prior to trying all the oral meds available. I consider any surgically implanted device to be the last choice after less invasive means have failed. Any surgical procedure is also very expensive. There are complications to ANY surgery. Any doctor who tells you different is nuts, or dishonest. An implanted epidural catheter is for use with an implanted pump that contains pain meds. This requires refilling periodically. That is only a needle through the skin into the device, but any time you break the skin, you risk infection. There is another type of implanted device that is similar in theory to a TENS unit, it consists of a battery unit connected to wire leads that go to the spine. It works by sending an electrical stimulation to interrupt the pain signals. This requires battery changes periodically, and the leads do not always stay in the proper place and may have to be surgically repositioned later on. More surgeries. More money. If you lose your health insurance for any reason, will you be able to keep up with the expense of implanted devices? I would personally ask for stronger pain meds in the opioid family, and a trial of other oral meds like antidepressants or antiseizure meds. Both of these last types of meds help mediate the neurotransmitters that carry the pain signals to the brain. I would only submit to ANY surgical intervention like the pain pump or the spinal cord stimulator if all else failed. I feel that using many different treatments for pain management is the best idea. PT, OT, TENS, biofeedback, cognitive behavioral therapy, etc., etc. plus oral meds including opioids can all help. I feel if you can get a small amount of relief from each of several treatment methods, the total amount of relief may be substantial, certainly worth trying before going under the knife. Darvocet has been shown in some studies to offer no more relief than plain tylenol. Tramadol is useful for moderate pain for many people but if it doesn<APO>t work for you, it is time to try other types of meds. I am not familiar with Flector patches. There are long acting morphine, long acting oxycodone, methadone and levorphanol, all in oral form for scheduled use every 8-12 hours for pain. Fentanyl comes in a skin patch that you only have to change every 2-3 days, but is only for use in people who are already dependent on opioids, not the first thing to try, but one if the oral meds don<APO>t work well for you. Oxycodone, hydrocodone, and immediate release morphine are all available for breakthrough pain, to be taken only when/if you need them. Ask the doctor what kind of result he expects with the surgical procedure he is planning, and what types of complications, adverse effects, (including expense), can happen before you make a decision. Often the doctor considers a 50% decrease in pain successful, while the patient may expect complete relief. This kind of disconnect can end in frustration and failure. EVERYONE I have spoken to that had either of these surgical interventions continued to need their opioid medications, just in a lower dose. Ask the doctor what his infection rate is prior to consenting. He should be able to tell you this. If he hems and haws, or says his patients never get infections, I would move on to another doctor. I would also ask him how may of these procedures he has done and how often he is currently doing them. He should have already done 100, and he should be doing about 4 per week to maintain his skills. The more of them a doctor does, the better results he should have. Practice makes perfect. If this pain management office only does injections and procedures, I would get a consultation from a pain management clinic that does the other non-invasive treatments. Take care, Annette""Put ""a doctor is wanted"" in the header, he will respond to direct questions, at least he always has for me. Take care, Annette""Thank you for your military service. I was in RN school in the late 1960s and they had disposable needles and syringes ( and they were not a new item back then), but who knows about the military, they come up with a lot of the newest trauma care, but are stuck in the Middle Ages in other areas. Tell your PM doc again to make you a treatment plan, or have the psychologist ask him for one. Tell him if he doesn<APO>t have one for you to just say so, but you need to know ahead of time what the plan is so you can relax and get through the coming days. Better for you to know what will happen. The point of the pump is to take lower doses of morphine, it doesn<APO>t sound like you are doing that??? What is you current daily dose of morphine via the pump? Not counting any breakthrough meds you take. Take care, Annette""My doctor always gives me the plan of action verbally at the time of the visit, she had me sign a consent for treatment when I started taking opiates daily also. I don<APO>t think people realize the number of active patients their doctors see, it often seems like they each think they are the only ones, I just wondered. I think NavalVeteran wanted a written out treatment plan rather than an oral one. Thank you for responding so quickly. Take care, Annette""NavalVeteran has posted a couple of times asking if a doctor should be expected to provide a patient with a treatment plan. I would like to know for my own self what the time frame should be for this? How long does it take for a doctor to write out a treatment plan for a patient? How many active patients does a pain management doctor have at one time? Thank you for your help. Take care, Annette""Who knows what the test will show??? Antibiotics do not work on your body, they work on the bacteria that are making you ill. It may be that you are genetically non-responsive to meds, I don<APO>t know, nor do I know everything. I would certainly tell you if I did. I would stick with one doctor, and do what he suggests. Take care, Annette""I have found in my professional and personal life that if a doctor goes to the trouble of diagnosing something, they treat it. But I have found on the internet that self-diagnosed thyroid problems are fairly common. I would suggest you try visiting some FMS sites, thyroid problems are fairly common there. That is where I was exposed to them. Hugs, Annette""My friend is an alcoholic and also takes pain meds as needed, he has no trouble getting them at all from the doctors and dentists he sees. I have to agree with your shrink, you need to be honest with you pain management doctors, and whoever prescribes your Adderal. Let him decide if you need it or not. Many adults used to be kids that grew out of ADHD and no longer require meds for it. If your other doctors really knew you longer they would know your alcohol history. You are only 27 years old. If you started drinking at less than 17 (ten years ago), your brain was affected worse than if you started drinking as an adult. By the way, you were out driving a car and got into a wreck very recently, you were on opiates then, were you also drinking, even a little? I hope not, since you had just started a new opiate regimen. I had elective surgery a couple of years ago, I was certainly up front with my surgeon about my 15 years of opioid use, and the hospital had no problem managing my pain. Nor did I have any problem finding a surgeon. Take care, Annette""Who knows, don<APO>t drink vodka and it won<APO>t matter. My dad never had a hangover of any kind, even during a dark part of his life when he drank constantly for a few months. Me either. Must be genetic. Take care, Annette""It is interesting that you did not say until this post that you felt she should not be in practice anymore. I personally do not believe that hepatitis in many of its<APO> forms should be a good reason to stop practicing medicine. You should really nose out of her private health business, and find yourself and your wife a new doctor. Take care, Annette""Is the doctor who prescribes the Oxycontin aware that you are not taking the second dose? I would suggest that you takes ALL your medicine bottles in a brown paper bag to ALL of your doctors who have prescribed any of them and check for interactions, let them all know you are having trouble sleeping. Do this fairly soon. Meanwhile if you have access to a nurse line through your insurance company perhaps you could call them and explain what is going on. Clonazepam, methocarbamol, and zanaflex all have muscle relaxant actions, should you really be taking all three at the same time? Ask your doctors? I also have FMS, insomnia is part of having FMS, I know this because I have it also. It sucks big time. The less sleep you get the more pain you have. It can be a vicious circle. Take care, Annette""Your post was very confusing, what RX did the doctor write that you refilled? Do you have medical coverage, and opt not to use it, or are you not covered at all? Why do you currently go days without meds? I have not missed a Doctor<APO>s appt. in 50 years, I have not been on pain meds that whole time either, why would you miss an appt.? You say you have only been going to the clinic you currently go to for nine years, but you also state you have been on the same dose for 12 years. You said this in one sentence,do you see why I am confused. I have not experienced what you have with your doctors or your pain management care. I am out West, where are you located? Some differences in care can be blamed on geography.""Like the other poster said, check your state laws, or call your state medical licensing board. They will have the best information for you. Take care, Annette""Ask your surgeon what to expect and what to do. You might try decreasing the amount of oxycodone rather than increasing the time between the doses. But run it past your MD first. Make certain you are sent to a pain clinic that does both interventionalist medicine as well as prescribing meds if you need/want more meds. Surgeons are poor at pain management after the first few months after a surgery anyway. You are better off with a pain management specialist. Take care, Annette""I would start with your pcp and ask for a pain management specialist that is not an interventionalist. Look for a pain management clinic that uses all kinds of oral meds (including opiates) and other treatments, not just injections and procedures. Call around before you make an appt. ask if they only do injections and procedures or if they offer all kinds of treatments including oral meds. I wouldn<APO>t ask for opiates specifically. I really feel that if you can get a small amount of relief from each of several different kinds of treatments including oral meds, that the total amount of relief will be worthwhile. My internist who is my pcp manages my pain management meds including opiates. I am a RN also. Welcome to the board. Take care, Annette""When I moved out of state and had no nursing connections to find a doctor with, I took my husband<APO>s insurance list and got on the phone. I would call the office blind and ask to speak to the office nurse or medical asst. in charge. I would explain to her what my situation is and what kind of doctor I prefer, then ask her if she thought any of the doctors there would be a good fit for me. I did not mention opiates at all. If she hesitated, then said any of them would be fine, I thanked her and hung up. When I found one who actually thought about it and named a name, I made an appt. and did an interview to see if I thought we would get along. That worked for me. During the interview I told the doctor my present meds including the opiates, but told her I understood if she didn<APO>t want to prescribe the opiates until she got to know me better. My rheumatologist from back home had agreed to write them as long as it took for me to find someone else. It just meant I would have to go see him every six months. On the third visit she told me she would take over my opiates as well as the other meds. I had done the same thing when I first saw the rheumatologist a couple of years before. Anyhow, that works for me. I was always pretty specific about what kind of doctor I wanted, one that would work with me, not one that just gave orders, and one that would accept research I had done as long as it was from reputable sites. I hope you find a doctor as easily as I did. Once you get your health in order, you can deal with your personal life as well. Take care, Annette""Good luck in your search for a doctor. My husband was on cymbalta for pain management. He was to take it twice a day. He developed insomnia also, we discussed it with his doctor and by changing it to one dose a day early in the morning, he was able to continue taking it until after he had his hip replaced and got of of pain management meds. Often with meds you have to play with the dosing and the timing until you find what works for you. I take neurontin for pain management and avoided going on it because I was afraid of the sedative effects. My doctor checked it out and suggested I try taking it all in one dose at bedtime rather than split up during the day like it is usually prescribed. I tried that, and it worked but I felt sluggish during the day. I adjusted the dose and moved it up to about 4-5 hours before bedtime and that worked best for me. After several months on a steady dose the side effects went away completely. That is often the case. I agree about getting too emotional in the office visit. I had to remind myself for a year or so that pain management should be considered the same as managing high blood pressure or diabetes. Once I got in to that mindset, I did better with communicating my needs to my doctor. Hang in there. Take care, Annette""I have heard of others with gastric bypass surgery complain of not processing meds well. Please let us know what finally works for you. Take care, Annette""First, I would talk to the doctor who put in and then removed the stent. If he says the pain is not from your kidney, then I would talk to my primary doctor see what she says. Take care, Annette""How was your Chiari Malformation diagnosed? It takes a special kind of scan to make the diagnosis. Did a neurosurgeon diagnose it to begin with? It is certainly possible to have Chiari Malformation and have another pain condition also. I would go to at least two neurosurgeons that actually do the surgery for Chiari Malformation and get independent opinions. There is some interesting reading at www.myalgia.com about Chiari Malformation and FMS. You might check it out. Take care, Annette""The only suggestion I have is to make an appt. and go see the doctor in the office to ask your questions. I hate playing phone tag with a doctor. I really don<APO>t feel you get the quality of care that you get sitting down face to face. I have had a similar injection, I never felt numb from the injection, but the pain in my shoulder went away. We are all different and will react differently to meds. Take care, Annette""I also have FMS, and recall the feelings that came along with it and not knowing anyone else with it. I was first diagnosed in 1995, I think. The truth is it will not kill you, and you will probably never be pain free again either. I recently stopped taking Ambien, I reduced it very, very slowly. I don<APO>t sleep well, but don<APO>t really expect to either. My next challenge is to slowly decrease the pain meds I take. Meanwhile, read all you can on reputable medical sites about fibromyalgia. Learning about something helps a lot. Take care, Annette""I have not had the gastric bypass surgery, but I have seen quite a number of people who have had it post and complain that they no longer absorb their oral pain meds. That leaves them with really limited options as far as pain management goes. If I were you I would try going on the fentanyl patch or other non-oral meds, and see if that works for you. If it did not work well for me, then I would probably decide not to have the bypass surgery. It is all about balancing risks and benefits. Only you can decide. I am not as heavy as you are, so it would not be as urgent a decision for me. Take care, Annette""An MRI is a test...They are very pricey, what do you think it would show? I think seeing a rheumie is a good idea. Take care. Annette""I am also appalled that this licensed person said this to you. Document this and send it to the board who licenses the pharmacists in the state you live in. I would also report this to the pharmacy itself. Their HR dept. needs to be aware of this. Meanwhile, I would stop taking the medicine until you can contact your doctor or someone in his office. Take care, Annette""I would never have any kind of invasive treatment done to control my pin until ALL non-invasive methods had failed me. All surgery has risks, anyone who tells you otherwise is just not telling the truth. Exactly what the risks are vary from person to person. If I ever get to the maximum amount of meds I can take without intolerable side effects, then I will have to consider surgical interventions, until then, no thanks. With your current feelings about the implant, I really don<APO>t think it would be wise to even try it. A positive mental outlook is very important in any kind of surgery. If you know in your heart that your body would not respond well to this kind of intervention, then don<APO>t do it, at least for now. Don<APO>t see an interventionist if you are not into that type of therapy. He is correct, that is what he has been trained to do and that is what he does. He is probably not the right kind of doctor for you to see at this point in your life. Find someone who is willing to work with you to find the patht hat you feel is right for you. You do have the right to know ALL treatment options that might help you, so you can make an informed decision. If this doctor doesn<APO>t know about your other options he should help you find someone who does. Take care, Annette""Hi, Grace It occurred to me that if you are taking a muscle relaxant it might be expected that it could adversely affect your vision because your eyeballs are moved by small muscles that attach to the eyeballs on their sides. Double vision can be caused by the eyes not focusing on the same image at the same time, so if the eyeballs are drifting apart you may see double. Please see an eye doctor, who is also a medical doctor, and ask her very specifically about this possibility. I may be completely wrong, I have been before. Take care, Annette""I think on Monday, I will leave a message for my eye doctor to call me back with more info on how she found this stuff out, I asked my pharmacist today if she had heard of this being a problem and she said no. I also see my internist next month, I will ask her also. Let me know what you can, talk to your pharmacist, see what he/she knows. I have found them to be very useful members of our healthcare teams. They find out these things very early on. Take care, Annette""Well, my ophthalmologist called me back and she said she did not recall where she got that information. When I told her my pharmacist had not heard anything about it, she dismissed that and she referred me to the Journal of Opthamology and said to put opiates and double vision in the search engine, I did and got 0 Results. I am not nearly as worried as I was, I will see my internist in Jan. She prescribes the opioid, I will ask it of her then. Take care and have a good New Year, Annette""Well, I spoke to a friend who happens to have his PhD in pharmacy, he told me that he could not find any studies that showed any connection between double vision and opiates, but he did find some anecdotal evidence of a connection, he felt it was dose related. I will speak to the prescribing doctor about this when I see her Friday. Take care, Annette""My prescribing doctor had also not heard of evidence based studies showing this, she suggested I see the pain management doctor that I have seen a couple of times in the past, she felt that he would know of this important adverse effect. She will refer me. Take care all, Annette""The eyeball often changes shape as one ages so that can explain some of it, I needed some correction long before I started opiates, I was also 20/20 or better when I was under forty. Adding the prisms to reading glasses is the next step. I guess I will do more research. Thanks for your input. Take care, Annette""Thank you for your response, Grace. I assume nothing, I would like links to peer reviewed journal articles if anyone has them, but anecdotal evidence like yours may also be helpful. My thanks for your experience and the trouble you took to reply. Take care, Annette""Hi, Charles Methadone is a long acting opioid, so I am on one. My eye doctor seemed to think it was the opioids I was on that was causing the trouble. Do you happen to have any links to articles about methadone and double vision? Take care, Annette""Do you happen to have any links to articles about gabapentin and vision problems? I have been on it for over 15 years as it deals well with multiple problems I would hate to go off of it. But vision trumps them all. Take care, Annette""Both of the doctors I see regularly told me the zolpidem and gabapentin and the opioid were not to blame for the changes in my vision when I specifically asked them. I guess I am looking for newer information, and hoping to find it here. Take care, Annette""My vision is really getting bad, I am seeing double a lot, especially when I am tired. I saw my eye doctor, an opthamologist, she told me that the opiates I am taking could be causing this. I am currently on methadone 10 mg. three times a day and oxycodone 25 mg. usually twice a day for BT pain. I recently stopped taking zolpidem (Ambien) slowly down from 15 mg. every night, to none for the last couple of weeks. I also take gabapentin 800 mg. once a day. The next step is for her to put prisms in reading glasses, she is hesitant to try this as your eyes then become dependent on those. Other than that she says me eyes are very healthy. I am 63 years old. No one has ever mentioned this as a adverse effect of opiates before. Nor have I read about it anywhere. If anyone has heard of it, or has links, please post. Take care, Annette""Hi Beth, Medicare paid for mine. United Healthcare was my Medicare Advantage policy back then. Look for an email. Hugs, Annette""Did the doctor you have a contract with change just the refill schedule or did he change the number of doses you can get? If he changed the refill schedule he should have also changed the number of doses you get to go along with it. Twice as many days should equal twice as many doses. If he did not, ask him why? Take care, Annette""Are you the same person who originally posted as an anonymous poster? Take care, Annette""That may be true, but being born in the US does not mean that one went to medical school here, I worked with a doctor who did not graduate from med school here. I also know a number of doctors who are US born and bred, and still they do not keep good records. Sorry, I agree with Beth on this one. Take care, Annette""I do accept your apology. Take care, Annette""You are great!!!!! Take care, Annette""You and I knew the letter was a phoney, but you took the time to explain it well enough for all to understand. You are great!!!! Hugs, Annette""I graduated from nursing school in 1970, and the scheduled drug list was old news then. I do agree with your closing comments though. EVERYONE should read the websites for any laws or regulations the have any questions about. Take care, Annette""Hi, Grace Opiates do not work for all people or FOR ALL TYPES OF PAIN. This may be why they do not work for your headaches. I do not know if this is true for your headaches or not. You might bring this to your doctor<APO>s attention, if you haven<APO>t already. I assume you have, but whatever. Take care, Annette""Please tell your doctor one more time at an appt. that you make for this issue alone. Also inform him that you would like him to suggest a different doctor if he cannot help you to bring the pain under better control. Unfortunately, many patients do not do this. Rather, they mention pain as an afterthought towards the end of an appt. for something else. The doctor SHOULD still address this, but studies show that they only listen to the initial complaint and deal with that. You might also take a witness with you to take notes. Do not take anything that may blur your memory of exactly what is said. I am posting to help you get better results from your appt. not to blame you in any way for your results at your last appt.""My primary care doctor prescribes my opiates. Since you said your primary care doctor used to be your pain management doctor (but she is actually a nurse practitioner, so primary care nurse practitioner would be clearer). Why can`t she prescribe them for you? Whatever you do, keep moving, Don`t get stuck by resting too much. I also have arthritis and CMS. I gained way too much weight laying about, it has been very hard to lose it. Take care, Annette""What does you doctor say? Tell him if he cannot help you to please suggest another doctor, perhaps a specialist, who can. Take care, Annette""I would not take a benzodiazepine, which is itself at least physically habit forming, for withdrawal symptoms from opiates. In my humble opinion that is just trading one problem for another. Clonidine is a blood pressure med which is also used to minimize opiate withdrawal symptoms. Take care, Annette""I think you are thinking of Clonidine, Klonipin is the brand name of clonazepam, a benzodiazepine that I ended I up hooked on and required medical intervention to wean off of. If you require help getting off of opioid pain meds, tapering VERY slowly as an outpatient should work. Clonidine might help you.

You can also take Tramadol, it is less strong than Endocet. Best of luck to you, Annette""Do you all know anything or have any links to articles linking opiates and double vision to one another? I am really wanting peer reviewed journal articles, I am only finding anecdotal stuff on message boards. Thank you so much for your time. Take care, Annette""Doctors talk to patients all day long, I would not think it would be useful for them to go home and read message boards at night. I would rather they spend any extra time reading medical journals. I am 58 years old and with one or two possible exceptions (more personality than anything else) I have been blessed with great doctors all my life. Take care, Annette""I read recently that it was wise to order a copy of your medical records from any doctor before having them sent anywhere so you will know what they say.

Take care, Annette""Why do you suffer after being discharged from a pain clinic if pot works so well for pain? Lest you make wrong assumptions, I tried pot many years ago for pain and it did not work at all just got me really loaded. I have read that nowadays with the different strains of pot, things are different. The state laws permit medical marijuana where I live. Take care, Annette""I agree, from what you have written you need to see a doctor. These symptoms are not normal. If you are a minor and depend on your mom to take you and she flat out refuses, I would suggest you ask a relative or even a school counselor to help you. You can even call child protective services if necessary. The state you live in makes the laws on how old you must be to see a doctor on your own. I live in Oregon and here you only have to be 15 to sign your own consent for medical treatment. In most states any girl having reproductive health issues can be seen at Planned Parenthood or a family planning clinic without a parent<APO>s consent. This at least might address the vaginal discharge issue. There are wide variations in normal when it comes to how much discharge and the odor. You didn<APO>t mention your age, when you last menstrual period was, or if you are sexually active, be prepared to answer all those kinds of questions. Take care, Annette""I am unaware of anything stronger than tramadol that is non-narcotic. That said tramadol information says not to take more than 400 mgs. per day. Unless your doctor knows something I don<APO>t he would say your pain is NOT controlled by 400mgs. of tramadol a day. If for some reason he has told you to take 12 pills a day, please call the company that makes your tramadol and ask them why they recommend what they do. Take care, Annette""You need to discuss this with a doctor before you need it. My doctor wishes to see folks in person, I am agreeable to that. She has always had a great medical asst. and office staff. It is the office staff or scheduler that makes her appts. that keeps her on time. That person decides how long a person should get for an appt. If it takes longer than that, she gets behind. I do not mind if she is behind once in awhile, but not every time I go and see her. I almost always see her within 20 minutes of my appt. time. She always apologizes if she is running late. By the way, I am on Medicare. Take care, Annette""The answer to your question is,""No one really knows."" Any person who tells they do know, are just guessing in my opinion. Survey should be your last option. Again this is my opinion. The last time I had a herniated disc in my neck, found for sure by MRI, the symptoms I was having essentially went away after several years. There is always hope. Take care, Annette""I think people forget that there are other types of treatments besides increasing narcotics if your pain levels go up. I always try adjusting my other meds or adding other meds first. I only increase my opiates as a last resort. The whole tolerance thing is poorly understood, it is often hard to tell if your original condition is worsening or if you are developing true tolerance. I just figure it doesn<APO>t really matter, I will probably be on opiates the rest of my life, so I better do my best to keep the doses as low as possible for as long as possible. I have found that with any meds that may increase your appetite, you need to be aware that you may have cravings and prepare for them. Eating low calorie snack items may prevent you from gaining weight with antidepressants or other ""possible weight gain"" meds. I manage to keep my weight within a set range. It is not as low as it probably should be, but it never has been. At least I do not gain any additional weight. Take care, Annette""Or the medical people will discover something physical is causing the symptoms, I can recall the olden days when asthma was considered an attention seeking behavior. Then reactive airways were discovered to be the cause. Take care, Annette""I would see a pain management specialist. Take care, Annette""I would opt for a pain management specialist that does more than just interventions or considers himself an interventionist. Be sure you have a specialist who uses daily drugs as well as procedures, injections, etc. I have found cognitive behavioral therapy to be very useful, in addition to my medications. Just remember we all different and what works for me may not work well for you. Take care, Annette""I use a generic MS Contin rather than a brand name extended release morphine like Kadian. It is far cheaper on my insurance plan, which has lower copays for generic drugs. I have never had any problem with them, I have used 5-6 different brands and cannot tell any difference. I don<APO>t feel it kick in, whether I take them every 8 or every 12 hours. At my current dose, I take them every 12 hours. I get nice continuous relief of my pain. It would not make your heart beat faster that I am aware of. I went ahead and looked it up in my drug book and morphine does not cause tachycardia, a fast heart beat. I don<APO>t know why you had a rapid heart beat. I do use breakthrough meds as prescribed. This is pretty normal for folks on extended release opiate therapy. When you first start using them it may take a few days to find the right dose for you, but once you find it, it should work pretty seamlessly. If you have just started using them, you will feel the difference in your pain levels, but once the dose is correct, you shouldn<APO>t feel it at all. The only downside I have ever had is constipation. This is one side effect that does not usually go away. The opiates cause the bowels to slow down, so you may need a stimulant type laxative. Some people get by with just a stool softener. Discuss a bowel care program with your doctor before you get constipated, it is easier to prevent than to fix. Take care, Annette""Discuss all these issues with your doctors when you see them. It sounds like you have many different issues that could cause the rapid heart beat episodes. Since you have only just begun using Kadian it may take a few dose adjustments to find the right dose for you. Some doctors would rather increase the scheduled long acting drug to the point where you don<APO>t need breakthrough meds, others use more of a balance of the two types of drugs. Ask your doctor how he feels about this. Take care, Annette""Since opioid are not used for migraines, please explain to me why she has been on all the opiates and muscle relaxant. You might answer you own question. I would suggest she see a therapist with experience with both chronic illnesses and addictions. You also need some therapy, nothing happens in a vacuum. Take care, Annette""Ditto to what everyone else said. It is time to go to the doctor and get evaluated. Take care, Annette""A doctor I used to see regularly in Reno always washed his hands IN FRONT OF ME at the start of our appt. I really did not think much of this at the time, until I had a doctor who did not do this small thing. I adore my present doctor, and I would not change anything else. Take care, Annette""Addiction is a terrible problem, one I would not wish on anyone. It is very difficult to cure and damages all parts of their lives. I o not believe addiction is any more prevalent among the rich and famous than any other group of people. Taking an opiate pain pill for pain is not what addiction is all about. Only about 5% of people who use opiate pain meds become addicted to them. That is a very low percentage for any side effect. It should always be watched out for, like you would any serious side effect, but it wouldn<APO>t keep me from using my pain meds. Take care, Annette""He can still exercise, there are programs available for even people in wheelchairs. Do not accept any excuses!!!! I have lost over 75 pounds, very slowly by increasing exercise, I finally found something I can do year in and year out, because I like it. I still have not changed my diet much at all. Take care, Annette""Hooray, Dave !!!!!!!! Take care, Annette""I think who manages chronic pain may vary from place to place. My pcp has generally been the doctor who manages my pain meds, still is. I had to get a consult from a pain management specialist, but after that my pcp prescribed for me. However, there is a really easy way out of the weekend/after hours phone calls. Federal law prohibits any doctor who has not treated a patient in person in the past from calling in scheduled drugs for them. All the family doc on the end of the phone has to do is quote the law and refuse to call in a RX. My doctor had emergency surgery once and I had to go in and see her associate in person at the office to get my RX refilled. Opiates are a poor choice for migraines, so that is easy to turn down for medical reasons. Addiction is a terrible problem and I would rather have chronic pain than be addicted. Take care, Annette""I am doing okay, I have decreased the 10 mg. dose of methadone to 5 mg.at 10 am & 6 pm, but still take 10 mg. at 2 am. I am still taking 2-3 doses of breakthrough meds in 24 hours, usually two doses. I will see a pain management doctor on Feb. 18, for a consult. No one but my eye Dr. has read anything about double vision and opiates. A friend of mine with a PhD in pharmacy he<APO>s read some anecdotal information,, but can<APO>t find any studies on the topic. He felt it was dose related. When I asked my eye doctor for links to info she has read, she said ""I don<APO>t read."" GASP! Not sure I will be back to see her. When I mentioned all of this to my internist, she suggested I see the pain management doc again. She felt he would have answers for me. After seeing you post about Calmare, I thought I would check with you and see if you had had any luck. Did you also have to stop all opiates prior to trying it? I am waiting with bated breath to hear what happens next week. Hugs, Annette""What do you mean by expensive, does insurance/Medicare cover it? Do you pay out of pocket for it? Hugs, Annette""Did you try the Calmare treatment? Did it help you at all? I hope it did, you surely deserve improvement. Love you, Annette""My eye doctor told me that my double vision was due to the opioids I was on. This was a good enough reason for me to get off of or decrease the opioids, I am sure other folks have their own reasons. If nothing else, I have been able to decrease the methadone. Take care, Annette""Please, do not discuss any medications with anyone, at least not by name or type of drug. Only your doctor needs to know, and hopefully he/she is prescribing them. Take care, Annette""Charles, I responded to your question of why decrease or stop it entirely above. The pain management doc I went to earlier this month did not agree with the eye doctor but he did come up with two ill effects of the long acting opioid I am on, neither of which are problems for me, yet. Thank goodness for that, but how about next time I see him? One year ago he only had one adverse effect to tell me about, now he has two, will he have three next time? IF I can get off completely, fine, if I can cut back, fine, if I stay at my current levels, fine too. Take care, Annette""I really have nothing to add to what Beth has already said. I will keep up with this post, and add anything I feel necessary. Take care, Annette"."Peppermintwindfarm, I recently saw a PM specialist. I had some questions about opioids, I have been on them daily for about 15 years now. Although, I have not had severe side effects, I am curious about what life would be like either off of them or on much lower doses. The good doctor was very positive, he said that I may well not need them anymore, or that I could do quite well on lower doses, or I might find I needed them on the same dosing regimen. He suggested I go VERY slowly, and decrease the long acting one first. I had already decreased the long acting opioid from 30 mg. per day to 25 mg. per day, now I am working on decreasing it another 5 mg. per day. I had stopped taking Ambien already, although not an opioid, I had also been on it for many years. I had no adverse effects at all, but was curious about doing without it. Life is fine, I have restless legs, and that has gotten somewhat worse, but it is tolerable so far. I had no withdrawal symptoms at all. I did very slowly decrease the dose from 15 mg. at bedtime to nothing at all. Take care, Annette""Call the neurologist back and ask to be put on their cancellation list in case anyone calls in and cancels. The best doc to see is one who has already seen you. As far as the Urinary tract infection goes. if you have finished the antibiotics you were given, and still have symptoms, see your regular doctor for that. If you have any symptoms like changes in balance etc., and cannot get into see your neurologist, go to the emergency room. They may only do whatever tests are needed to find out if you are dying, ask the doctor there who to follow up with and do so. Take care, Annette""My husband got put on a cancellation list and he got an appt. within three weeks rather than the three months wait he had at the time. He had a couple of weeks notice, so it worked out great for us. It was a very popular, well respected doctor. As far as your daughter goes, if she is an adult, you are better off to leave her to deal with the doctor, with your advice as you decide to give it. As a retired nurse, I am familiar with the mistakes that can happen in medical records. The ONLY person who can correct them is the person who wrote them. She should calmly ask the doctor who wrote the note, or signed the chart to make any necessary corrections. Do not bother with office staff any more than absolutely necessary to make appointments, etc. Take care, Annette""Of course the doctor told you nothing was wrong after he finally got around to doing the xray, an old, healed fracture has nothing to do with an acute problem. People do not understand when a doctor says the xray did not show anything. He means it did not show anything helpful. Not that it was absolutely, book normal. I am by no means saying this doctor is one you should see again, I sure wouldn<APO>t see him again, but for different reasons. Take care, Annette""My doctor<APO>s office and every hospital and doctor<APO>s office since has given me WRITTEN information explaining the HIPAA rules, read what they give you. Take care, Annette""If you take them one hour before your scheduled appointment you should do fine. Take care, Annette""You need to use your voice and tell the doctor you are in pain and are not sure the pills you have from the emergency room will last until your next appointment. The best time to tell him this is during your appointment, but it is not too late, phone him just this one time, and ask over the phone. Be prepared to have to drive over and pick up the Rx. in person, it is against the law for the doctor to call it in to the pharmacy. Do not worry about the office location or any reputation the town has, if necessary act dumb. Take care, Annette""Try them and see if they work for you, amputations are not as bad as one would think, once the doctor cleans them up. My husband had lost the end of a finger and the meds you describe worked fine for him. If they don<APO>t work, just tell the doctor. Take care, Annette""Call your doctor immediately. Take care, Annette""Please, tell your doctor exactly what you have told us. Tell him how you are feeling now and why you decided to stop taking the Butran`s Patch to start with. I have a feeling you may not be doing things the best way to achieve your ultimate goal. As long as you decrease the opiates very slowly, you can get off of them, although you may have the pain that lead you to start them to begin with. Take care, Annette""You sound like you have a good head on your shoulders, keep up the research you are doing and you will be fine. Take care, Annette""I used Neurontin first, then it<APO>s generic as it became available, total of about 15 years. It was studied and approved for diabetic neuropathy, post-herpes neuropathy, and a third kind that I do not recall right now. I have a type of illness that will last forever, so I expect to take it forever, but I think it treats the symptoms rather than actually curing anything. However, it does not act like a pain pill, you must take it on a schedule, continuously, for it to work. I think your body heals itself as well as it can, while you take this drug. Take care, Annette""I think if it were caused by an injection, it would hurt regardless of the position you were in, I am not positive though. All I can suggest is to write down your symptoms, when they happen, etc. and take these to your doctor<APO>s. Take care, Annette""If you carry your wallet in your back pocket, put it in your front pocket for awhile. An ER doc I worked with once had a patient do that and it cured him. Thank goodness for small towns, and running into patients at the grocery store. If it doesn<APO>t work, sorry. Take care, Annette""It was worth a try. Take care, Annette""You said your new pcp is not comfortable writing RXs for you for pain meds, but she is doing it??? That is a good thing. It is a beginning. Perhaps as she gets to know you and trust you she will continue. What do you take/do besides the Lortabs for your pain? Get your records from the neurosurgeon that shows you have already been referred to PM and went, and what he recommended. Get your records from the PM place and show them to her, too. If you have always been compliant in trying to do what the doctors ask you to do, she should be able to see that from your records. As far as the five hour round trip for you to go to pain management, that may be what you have to do. You may have to consider moving closer to medical care if you have chronic conditions. Take care, Annette""My husband was on opiate therapy for chronic pain management, he had no trouble managing his pain when he went to the hospital and had his hip replaced. That was the cause of his pain. The pain management team at the university hospital where he went were in charge of his pain and of course, I was concerned that he would not be well taken care of. But, he WAS. He had little to no pain while in the hospital. They used two patient controlled pain med pumps, one had IV opiates in it, and the other went through a catheter into his hip, it contained a local anesthetic and numbed the nerves involved. He tapered off the methadone after the surgery was behind him and had no withdrawal symptoms at all. Every doctor I have ever been to told me at the first meeting that they don<APO>t prescribe opiates for chronic pain, but they all offered to do so after they got to know me better, usually after 3-4 appts. If they told everyone on the first visit they would be happy to give them opiates, they would be inundated with drug abusers. They have to filter them out somehow. I can<APO>t think of any way that works 100% of the time without affecting the real chronic pain person. Since you state clearly that you do not wish to go back on Oxycontin again, and using any opiate would cause the same kind of dependence that you wish to avoid, I am not sure what you are asking for??? There are other non-opiate pain management treatments that you can use, try them. There is no guarantee they will work, but the cumulative effect of several that give you mild relief when used alone may be worth using together. Take care, Annette""Nearly everyone has disc disease in their back by the time they are adults, the ruptured disc may not be causing your pain at all, depending on the level of the disc. It is impossible to tell from the test you had whether the pain you are having is related to the ruptured disc at all. Read as much as you can about disc disease, chronic pain, etc. See several doctors, then ask them intelligent questions, get answers, and trust your gut feelings. Take care, Annette""Dave has great suggestions as usual, his links are great. One other choice I suggest is seeing a neuroradiologist or having him/her read your imaging tests. My husband was offered this and I found him to be a great help. Take care, Annette""Ditto!!! Please just ""Report"" this Skid Mark, don<APO>t reply to him at all. Hugs, Annette""Do not stop participating here due to one person<APO>s behaviour, just ignore him/her. My late mom`s advice!!! Take care, Annette""I replied to this on a different thread, please read it there. Take care, Annette""Since you have not gotten any RXs since mid-January of this year you have completed most of the opioid withdrawals by now. How is your pain, where does it hurt? The doctors are free to listen to anything anyone has to say about you, they cannot give out any information at all about you. In some places they will discuss your care with your spouse, but they should not, especially since you have told them to stop it. Take care, Annette""You may have got a sprain from what sounds like an inversion injury, take very good care of your ankle. An ace bandage or some kind of stretchy ankle support most of the time is what I would do, along with rest, and elevation above your heart level while you study. See a doctor as needed of course, especially since you have found yourself in pain. Ask exactly what the doctor means by ""subsided"". Does the doctor mean that the pain is gone completely? Take care, Annette""You are welcome of course. Did you see the doctor? What did he say about the pain? Take care, Annette""See a sports doctor, or an orthopedic surgeon. Please do not play baseball that requires long throws until after you see the doctor and do what he suggests. I don<APO>t know your age, but the wrong kind of care NOW can ruin your shoulder FOREVER. Do your research. Take care, Annette""The easiest thing is to just stop reading and posting. I don<APO>t know if there is an official way to delete a free account. Take care, Annette""Any doctor can make that assessment. The doctor who writes your RXs for the pain medicines should be doing some kind of adverse effect assessment and documenting this assessment in your chart at every visit. Any doctor you see for anything else should have been trained to make some type of assessment. He/she should pass that information along to the prescribing doc. Take care, Annette""Have you tried going to a headache specialist instead of a spinal specialist? Perhaps a headache specialist could help you get rid of or minimize the headaches. Take care, Annette""Best of luck to you. Not all pain management docs are also headache specialists, ditto with neurologists. I am glad you found docs that work for you. Take care, Annette""Because you are having pain that is the same as what you had before, I would also suggest you call and make an appt. to see the surgeon in person, tell him and show him exactly where the pain is. Be very clear, and ask him exactly what type of pain you should have as a result of the surgery. Take care, Annette""I saw a pain management specialist, I have seen him twice before, he said I am the first person in his memory who checked the box for double vision, or even mentioned it. He was also unaware of any studies on this subject. So, we have on one hand the ophthalmologist who doesn<APO>t read, but started all this by saying the opioids were causing my double vision, and voting against her is my internist, my pharmacist, and the PM doc. A good friend of mine, a PhD in pharmacy, did a search and found no studies, but did find some anecdotal stuff, he felt it was dose related from what he did find. What are your thoughts on this? I am not nearly as worried as I was. Take care, Annette""I found discussing this with my neurologist very helpful, he could figure out from the time of my last dose of whatever drug I was taking, and the time my next headache started, if it was a rebound or not. Take care, Annette""If your headaches are debilitating let your neurologist know, otherwise what is your question? Take care, Annette""I know what it is, YUCK. I personally would see another neurologist, there are headache specialists, ask when you set up the appt. where his/her area of expertise is so you know how much to count on what is told to you. Above all, if you do not feel good about the doctor, use your feet and leave. Take care, Annette""Please do not take aspirin and ibuprofen on the same day, as they are both NSAIDs. Talk to your doctor or dentist. Take care, Annette""Thank you, Beth and Dave. Take care, Annette""I would also suggest you utilize your pharmacist, I have found them to be very helpful as members of my healthcare team. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know exactly what you mean when you say ""her testicles have slowed and stopped with blood flow through them."" Please ask her to post directly as it makes for better understanding. Take care, Annette""Why has the blood flow to the right testicle stopped and the left one slowed down? Sorry this is not my area of expertise. Is she on female hormones? What did her doctor tell her to expect prior to her being locked up? Take care, Annette""Take your meds exactly as they are prescribed. You cannot go wrong that way. Take care, Annette""Go see a doctor and get a proper evaluation. Take care, Annette""Try Googling ""Free clinics in (your city)"" or call the Goodwill, Salvation Army, etc. Lots of communities have free or discount clinics for folks without insurance. They can<APO>t afford to advertise though, so info is usually spread by word of mouth. Take care, Annette""How old are you? Take care, Annette""It depends on how they, the folks in the doctor`s office, code it, as well as the insurance company. My insurance, Medicare, refused to pay for it as they did not consider it medically necessary. I told my doctor and I got no further bills for it from the lab. I also kept an eye on my Medicare notices and they were not billed again. Take care, Annette""Ditto, blessedladyptl, is correct. The FDA does not require urine drug screens for chronic pain patients that I am aware of at all. You can check on their website for information. Take care, Annette""Hi, Charles Is Sativex now available in the US<APO>? I watched a special last night on TV and when that was made, Sativex was only available in Britain. It was a new special this was the first airing, I assumed it was not available here yet. Take care, Annette""You have been prescribed Clonazepam AND diazepam at the same time!! Please get at least one more opinion from a doctor you respect. Both are benzodiazepines. I really question taking both drugs together, or taking either one with opiates. That said, if pot is the only thing that helps, I would move to a place where it is at least legal locally. Keep in mind if you choose to use it, that it is illegal by federal law which trumps local laws. Take care, Annette""You said in the post above that you have not had any meds since Feb. I am a bit confused, but I think I understand. Oxycodone is available in a long acting formula called Oxycontin that should last 8-12 hours. Take care, Annette""Because the two drugs do the same thing in the same way, I would take one or the other, but not both together. I also would not take benzodiazepines with opiates do to recent studies. It is just not a good idea. You end up with an increased risk of falls, and death. Recent data shows that primary care docs have increased giving out RXs for both of these, and that pain management specialists are handing out fewer. Take care, Annette""I was really worried about this, but in this state so far, docs are not worried and are not treating pain patients like addicts. I have decreased my doses of opiates anyhow, and am tolerating more pain if necessary. Take care, Annette""I do not know what to say to you. My family doc, an Internist, who is not a pain management specialist, has written my pain medicine prescriptions for about 15 years. Someone is incorrect about outlawing primary care docs from doing this. Take care, Annette""I am so sorry, I misunderstood what was written. My bad. I would start a new thread, if nothing else, it would help with confusion. Take care, Annette""""Back issues"" is not a diagnosis. What specific diagnosis did he give you? I would hold off on carpal tunnel fixes until I was sure that was the problem. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a very specific problem, and what will fix it will not fix ""back issues"". Take care, Annette""Discuss it with your doctor.He may have other options available to you for your condition. Please take the pills as prescribed or at least explain to your doctor your reasons for taking it differently than as prescribed. Some side effects do not happen right away, or may be irreversible once they do occur. Some drugs do not interact well with some over the counter drugs, so it is important to talk your doc EVERTHING you take, including ibuprofen, Advil etc. Ibuprofen is the same drug as advil by the way, although I am sure you are aware of this.""Good advice, success must be defined so you understand exactly what is meant by the word. One doc may consider success to mean an increase in function, another may think a decrease in pain does, but the patient may define success as zero pain and perfect function. This patient may never be content with any outcome. Take care, Annette""No, you did not give me that impression at all. I was just trying to give an example, so folks would understand exactly what I meant. Take care, Annette""Addiction is not what you need to be concerned about as much as rebound headaches. Please see a headache specialist or a sinus specialist. Percocet can cause headaches, in addition to knocking them out. Take care, Annette""Prevent the headache from ever starting to begin with. Whether through prevention drugs or lifestyle choices, it is always better to prevent the headache to start with. Take care, Annette""What federal regulations are you talking about that caused the doctor to ""pull the rug out from under"" you? I am wondering since I depend on opioids to function. Take care, Annette""It is VERY important for you to get a definition of success from everyone, including doctors, that you talk to about this. You may well find that the definition is different for everyone. Take care, Annette""Get checked out by your primary care doctor. I swear by physical therapists, go see one if your doc suggests it might even be remotely helpful. Take care, Annette""I had the surgery for this problem, after trying injections, splints, etc. I found the surgery to be quick and easy, I wished I had done it first, instead of after everything else, it would have saved a lot of time off, resting, etc. But, we are all different, and respond to different things. Take care, Annette""Be sure your doc is aware that in addition to migraines you are having pain from your multiple sclerosis, and that you are taking the Fiorinal with codeine prescribed for your migraines for your other pain. Nothing with codeine or any other narcotic is prescribed for any kind of headaches anymore due to rebound headaches that are caused by all types of narcotics. There are all kinds of newer medications for migraines these days. Ask the doctor to prescribe something else for the muscle spasms and pain due to the multiple sclerosis. I have migraines in addition to other types of pain due to other problems. I know the dilemma you find yourself in. Take care, Annette""I also have fibromyalgia, so I can address that half of your problem. I am not familiar with Cross collagen disease, so you will have to go on with that search. You will need to adjust your life for the fibro though, to find your levels of pain and fatigue. Usually they come on one or two days after any exertion. Read about it, but find your own way, we are all different, remember that always. I made some changes that were both unnecessary and were bad choices based on information that I took at face value at the time. You should also look at your spouse, your marriage, and your own feelings. Pay someone to clean your house, I did for years, it""was the best thing I ever did. Sex is something everyone has to come to terms with, how often, how important it is, etc. Being a much older woman, I would suggest if you have the energy to do the personal training, etc. that you do, you might not be honestly able to say you are too tired to have sex. Maybe it hurts, look at positioning. Talk about it. Sorry about having two posts, I am still getting used to posting on my Kindle rather than my PC. My fingers are too big for the tiny keyboard, lol. Take care, Annette""You may need to redefine yourself, I had to and it was very upsetting. Necessary, though. Take care, Annette""Ditto to what Beth said regarding not allowing yourself to be abused, even verbally. It is still abuse. Of course, you are not in the mood to have sex with him. Take care, Annette""Dilaudid, or any opiate for that matter, is a poor medicine for headaches or for menstrual cramps. But, if that is what works for you and you do not take many of the pain pills per month, I wonder what else is going on. Are you getting the dilaudid from one doctor and the vicodin from another doctor? Or do you get all the meds from one doctor? Is your new doctor a neurologist, a PCP, a neurosurgeon, a GYN surgeon? One kind of doctor does not do all of these different things. Zoloft is an SSRI, an antidepressant drug. Antidepressants are frequently used to decreases the number and severity of headaches if one has headaches more than three times a month. You do. I don<APO>t think it is fair to assume the doctor wants you to trade 30 days of one kind of pills for 6 days of another kind of pills. I believe he is trying to decrease your total number of headache days per month. Zoloft like all drugs has side effects, and both opiates and antidepressants can cause dependency. But antidepressants are not drugs of abuse, opiates are. I have no idea what your previous medication history is, but generally speaking one starts out with non-opiate drugs for cramps and headaches and works up to things like opiates. Perhaps you have already done that, if so, get your records and show them to your new doctor, whoever he turns out to be. Take care, Annette""I am somewhat cynical, I think it is all about patents. If it is approved now, then the drug company can ask for a new patent when the present one is nearly up and they have a tamper resistant version available. Take care, Annette""I also have fibromyalgia, it is tough to live with this disorder. Take care, Annette""Any hydrocodone product that did not have another medicine mixed in with it has always been Schedule 2 and the ones with another drug mixed in were Scedule 3. This was my understanding anyway. Only compounding pharmacies even made a stand alone product containing hydrocodone. What does REMS stand for? Take care, Annette""Thanks a bunch. Do you happen to know what percentage of users become addicts as far as hydrocodone goes? Has it been figured out separately from other opiates? Take care, Annette""Thanks for responding. I do appreciate it a lot. So, REMS comes under the FDA. I knew that the FDA had recommended that any drugs that contained hydrocodone should be Schedule 2 rather than the Schedule 3 that they have been. Since I stopped working/volunteering, I am somewhat out of the loop as far as alphabet soup goes. Take care, Annette""Please, keep your arm elevated or no amount of ANY pain meds will help you. Just hanging your arm over your head will do, it will look strange but it will work. Keep the break higher than the level of your heart. Ask the flight attendant for some ice in a plastic bag to put on the wrist, it is fine to put it over the plaster splint or whatever kind of splint is used in Bali. This will be even funnier looking than hanging your arm over your head. So what! It WILL make it feel better. Take care, Annette""My spouse had one longer leg before his hip replacement, his surgeon recommended he use shims in the shorter legs shoe. He had already thought of that and added another one. He told my spouse that he could not guarantee even lengths due to the large difference prepping but he did manage to even them out. See your knee surgeon about the pain you are having in your operative knee, followed by a consultation with another knee surgeon. Demand an""Sorry about that. Imaging study, the kind you have is dependent on what the ordering doc is looking for. Take care, Annette""Diphenhydramine might help with itching and might not. I would keep a written journal of when you take the hydrocodone/acetaminophen and when the itching starts. It could be a side effect rather than an allergy. The diphenhydramine works best on an allergy. Just a thought. Take care, Annette""I would avoid meperidine it causes seizures, and it is very difficult to tell which patients will get toxic and when. Take care, Annette""I am tired and chose not to read your post. Next time please divide your post into paragraphs, it makes it much easier for tired folks to read. I will try to read it later. Take care, Annette""I truly do not know what is wrong with you. I would get another opinion, see an orthopedic doctor who specializes in shoulders and have an examination, history, and whatever lab work/imaging studies he suggests. Then see where you stand. The original diagnosis might have been wrong. It might have been correct, I don<APO>t know, it is just a suggestion. Take care, Annette""The law varies from state to state. Some states would consider you impaired just by having drugs in your system. Other states only consider you impaired if you cannot pass a sobriety test. Check the state laws where you live, and be very careful and aware whenever you might take more than your usual dose or are increasing your dose. Ask a loved one to tell you if they think you seem off your game. Even if it is legal to drive while taking them, you want to do the moral thing and not get in an accident where you might hurt someone else, or even yourself. Many meds other than opiates can cause impairment. Take care, Annette""Hi, Beth, I am so sorry to hear of your loss. I don<APO>t know what to say. Apparantly, Calmare has not become easily available yet on the West Coast. I asked my pain management consultant about it and he had never heard of it. He said he had no memory of anyone checking off double vision in the many years that it was on the form he uses in his office. He had never heard of it being related to opiate use. Again, I am so sorry to hear of your loss. Hugs, Annette""I would get anther opinion, go see a specialist, have him examine your foot/ankle and take a proper history, and make a diagnosis. Then go with your gut. Continue to see the doctor you feel most comfortable with. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy is a very serious problem, start treatment and follow through with it if that is what you do have. Take care, Annette""I do not have an idea of what is wrong with you, but I can certainly send you hugs and my hope you will find some help in feeling better. Take care, Annette""Why should she stay on fentanyl if, first, she is able to say she wants off of it, and secondly, she has NO diagnosis that there is anything wrong with her. She should do exactly as she pleases. I am pro choice, in all things. Especially in medical care. I am pro pain meds when the patient and their doctor agree it is the best thing. Take care, Annette""Do as you and your doc think best. That said, I will put in my two cents worth. Are you currently taking a short acting opiate for breakthrough pain? If you are currently taking fentanyl 12.5 mcg/hour for pain, I would discuss with your doctor the possible benefits of changing to an oral opioid for the next step, if you decide to continue the taper with the idea of getting off all your meds. If you went from fentanyl 25 mcgm/hr to fentanyl 12.5 mcgm/hr and got sick from withdrawals, I would not be at all surprised, that is a drop by 50% of the hourly dose. I think that is way too much at a time. By VERY slowly decreasing your dose of pain meds, you should be able to settle on whatever dose is appropriate with minimal withdrawal symptoms. Be open to staying on pain meds if you find you still need them. Take care, Annette""Talk to your PM doctor about not being able to feel your orgasms. You have never said whether or not you have discussed this with your wife or your pain managment doctor. Take care, Annette""Is that put there by the poster or by a moderator? Take care, Annette""Good to know! She hasn<APO>t posted anyhow. My heart also breaks for folks with RAD, or Shingles<APO> post Herpetic Neuralgia, or Trigeminal Neuralgia. I would guess anything that hurts worse or differently than my own pain really scares me. Hugs, Annette""Calmare apparently has not made it to the Northwest Coast yet as the pain management specialist I spoke with a couple of months ago had not heard of it. Until insurance covers it, I can<APO>t see many people being able to pay for it. Hugs, Annette""You might ask her doctor if Lidoderm patches might work for her. I use them for FMS pain on my hips and legs and they really do help me. Someone else who used to post here used them and got very good relief, when I read her posts, I asked my doctor about them. Perhaps they would work for her without interfering with her breathing. A TENS unit may also help. It is a very difficult balance when you use opiates along with COPD. Starting with a very low dose and working up to a dose that works for her without affecting her breathing could be tricky. Has she seen a pain management doctor? That might be better than her PCP. Make certain that he also knows about the COPD, and have any meds she is to take run by her lung specialist first. Good luck to you both. Take care, Annette""I would do more research before agreeing to have this done. What does your primary care doc think of this procedure? Things to ask the surgeon ahead of time: What complications are possible? What is your personal rate for each of these? How many have you done? What is the infection rate for you personally? If the surgeon answers there are no complications, he is perfect, or he has done less than 100 procedures, run do not walk away from his office. You should not trust him. Many places and people will say if a surgeon has done less than 100 procedures of any kind, he is still practicing, and still a beginner. You want an experienced surgeon, in the procedure you will have done. Take care, Annette PS-Also leave if he has no numbers or answers to your questions. GOOD doctors keep track of things.""You may never be pain free, you just ought to be able to lower your pain levels significantly. Take care, Annette""If it sounds too good to be true, it is.

Take care, Annette""You may need cardiac meds rather than pain meds for any chest pain you may have. Talk to your doctor, be sure he understands where your pain is, and what is causing it. Take care, Annette""All I can really suggest is that the two of you get counseling together. She needs to know the difference between using meds and abusing meds, and I doubt she will take your word for it. Perhaps hearing it from a qualified expert would help. Good luck.

They keep changing them, too. Take care, Annette""My heart5, if you press reply directly under Grace`s post it will say it is a reply to her and not to Dave. Do not worry though, old timer`s will usually read all posts under their original post. Take care, Annette""Grace, please discuss the increased frequency with whatever doctor cares for them in addition to the doctor who cares for the pain in your skull and neck. If they are different, of course. Meanwhile, keep a journal, please include headaches, pain in your skull and neck, what helps, what does not help, etc. Details may be important, write them down.

You might go there, if you haven<APO>t already. Take care, Annette""It was listed as a Migraine Community I think. Take care, Annette""First, read what the FDA says for real at their own website. I hate to say it, but many doctors say someone else is making them do it when no one is. Keep in mind that the FDA is a federal entity and whatever they say applies to the whole country, not just your doctors office. Take care, Annette""Social Security changed the date of disability for me, they moved it back to about six months BEFORE I had requested it. Of course, this was back in the 1990s. It was much needed money anyway. Take care, Annette""Well, what is/was your plan? Take care, Annette""I have cut down the methadone I take by half for two of the three doses I take, and continue the BT meds as before. I did this after tapering off of Ambien completely. Simply because I felt like it. I am chicken#### so had I had any withdrawals I would have given up. Please do not assume you will go through withdrawals just because you have read about it somewhere. Also do not assume you know what the doctor is thinking, ask him what happens if you get relief from the RFL, and what happens if you don<APO>t. Take care, Annette""Please do let us all know what happens, it is very interesting when doctors tell us stuff. Take care, Annette""Talk to your doctor, he has heard it all. He will tell you when to take your migraine meds for best effect during these horrible headaches. What a downer they must be.

Many medical conditions take quite a long time to ""declare"" themselves, or to be diagnosed. Your daughter should pick the doctor she is most comfortable with, and tell him/her any new symptoms, as well as the fact that the pain is now constant. A journal is very helpful for difficult situations like this.

Take care, Annette""Demerol is rarely used any more in hospitals, although with your allergies, finding the right drug may be difficult. Perhaps methadone would be a choice for you, please get a second opinion from a pain management specialist. Meanwhile take what your doctor prescribes for you. Take care, Annette""No one can see you or examine you, the only sensible thing is to tell you to go where you can be examined properly, by a qualified, medical professional. A hospital. Since it is now Monday evening, I hope you are feeling better, or have seen someone and are on the road to recovery. Take care, Annette""I would discuss pain issues with your primary care doctor, if necessary, get a referral to a pain management specialist. The doctor who actually did the surgery is not as well trained in pain management as you would think. Take care, Annette""It is your surgeon<APO>s job to explain to you precisely what he is planning to do, ask him what pain to expect, the recovery time, etc. Best of luck to you. I have not had this surgery, so I am not much help to you. Take care, Annette""Hi, welcome back! I am so sorry you need yet more surgery. Please don<APO>t feel that you must be doing poorly to visit here, although I am sure when you feel good, you must have better things to do than come here.

Take care, Annette""I take generic methadone for the long acting drug, and generic Oxycodone for the short acting one. They work well for me. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""I take methadone as my long acting opioid, and oxycodone for breakthrough pain. Works for me. Take care, Annette""I need to take the methadone three times a day. The oxycodone does not have acetaminophen in it at all, that is a good thing. I take five, 5mg. tablets at a time, maybe two times a day. The pain management doctor that I consult with says I may need six tablets at a time. Pain levels are individual, and should be used as a trend for an individual. I am not sure what use they would be to you in this context. Take care, Annette""Sorry, this is a dumb mistake on my part.""I would see a neurologist and ask for his opinion. Take care, Annette""I vote for seeing another doctor and getting a third opinion. See a doctor who does a lot of this type of surgery, be clear that if he suggests surgery, you have a doctor to do it for you, and that you are just consulting him for his opinion. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Blame your insurance company, not Obamacare. Insurance companies have non-preferred drug lists that often change, the one connected with my husband<APO>s old employer did the same thing years before Obamacare was even thought of.

Take care, Annette""Please ask your surgeon all your questions prior to having anything done.

I suggest a good Chinese medicine specialist. Do make sure he is licensed. Good luck to you. Take care, Annette""Hi, Sunshine I had surgery several years ago after being on chronic pain treatment including being on narcotics for 15 years. I told the surgeon that my primary doctor prescribed my pain meds and would do so after my surgery, as long as that was okay with her. She still offered me a RX for pain meds on discharge and I declined taking it. I required very little additional pain medicine for a very short time after surgery. Take care, Annette""If you like the OT, ask him/her what she/he suggests. I had deQuervain<APO>s tendinitis in my non-dominant wrist and went through the same basic thing you have, but nothing helped and I finally had surgery. I wish I had done it first, I declined any preoperative medicine or drugs that would impair me afterward, the surgery took 7 minutes start to finish. I had been a nurse for years and wanted to watch, lol. I had one set of vitals taken and went home with my husband. Take care, Annette""I do the same thing when I have the blues. Sorry, I live in Oregon and can<APO>t help you with any suggestions on doctors, we are not allowed to name doctors by name here anyway. Take care, Annette""I would just tell the doctor that you have tried procedures and injections and they didn<APO>t work for you, that you would prefer to use medications for now. If he suggests any injections, I would ask for evidence based research that shows they are useful for your type of pain. If he can<APO>t provide such research, I would not try his injections. I have FMS and I feel it IS nerve pain. From everything I have read, I feel FMS is a neurological disorder that amplifies pain signals. Any pain you get from anything else may be amplified to a much higher level due to the FMS. I don<APO>t think the cause of the pain is important in FMS, I just treat the pain. We have ruled out anything serious, so I just stick with what I know works. I don<APO>t try anything without evidence based studies showing it may work. Are you seeing a therapist for your depression? That is also important to treat. Take care, Annette""I went to one interventionist years ago before I realized there were two different types of pain management specialists. She offered to do trigger point injections, even though I had no trigger points. When I asked her where she was going to inject, she showed me the tender points of the FMS diagnosis exam. I explained to her the difference between trigger points and tender points, and told her I would pass for now. After that experience, before I made an appt. with a pain specialist, I asked if they did only injections and procedures or if they also used oral meds, PT, OT, cognitive therapy, biofeedback and all the other pain treatments available. If they were just interventionists, I never made an appt. They do what they do, it is like going to a surgeon when you are no way ready to have surgery and want a medical treatment. The surgeons just don<APO>t do that job. I am a RN and did some volunteer work with the state. Part of the training was a class in how to evaluate medical studies. I have used that info in my personal life to decide if a study has enough participants and was set up correctly to get valid results. Of course, I wouldn<APO>t do something based on a positive study that only had 10 participants. You don<APO>t find good evidence based research to support all kinds of procedures or medicines. If they don<APO>t have them, and I have had poor results from a similar procedure I would decline doing it again. But, by asking the question of a doctor, you will find out if he knows of any studies at all and what kind of studies he bases his practice on when you check out the ones he does give you. If you don<APO>t know how to check these studies yourself, you might take them to your PCP and ask his opinion. I don<APO>t care about a doctor<APO>s ego. I don<APO>t go to doctors I don<APO>t trust, if a doctor I let do something to me isn<APO>t good at what he does, I would not have chosen him. Anyone who told me it didn<APO>t work because HE personally didn<APO>t do it would lose me as his patient. That is too arrogant for me. I have several chronic pain conditions, I just treat the pain. I don<APO>t over analyze it. In my experience the pain from FMS and neuropathic pain all respond to the same treatments. What works for the nerve pain from my disc disease will usually work for my FMS and vice versa. The only thing that would be different is steroids, I don<APO>t believe that would help my FMS, even though it sometimes helps other nerve pain. I rarely use steroids and only in short courses anyway. I have had sciatica in the past from poorly given injections in my butt, and the quality of that pain is not different from the severe pain in the hip and legs that I get from FMS. I can certainly describe my FMS pain as sharp, burning, constant, and severe without my meds. Everyone perceives pain differently. I have been lucky in having my health care providers including both my doctors and pharmacists. When I was diagnosed with FMS in the late 1990s my pharmacist used to print out articles for me regularly. Many years back, they had studies that showed folks with FMS had higher levels of substance P in their spinal canals than did other people, and PET scans showed definite differences between FMS and non-FMS patients who were experiencing pain. None of my doctors: PCPs, neurologists, neurosurgeon, rheumatologists, opthamologists, orthopedists, dentists, etc. ever told me they had any question that FMS was real. I never heard any of that until I went on line to message boards. I guess I have had good doctors, lol. Take care, Annette""Try acupuncture if you believe in it. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""Lyrica didn<APO>t work for me at all but Neurontin does, go figure. Take care, Annette""I am so glad that your SCS has worked out well for you. I continue to take oral meds for my chronic pain, but if I ever get to the point where I decide to take a surgical approach, it is good to know that some people have had a positive experience with it. Take care, Annette""I take methadone for chronic pain, it is wonderful for me. It is very cheap. Less than $30 a month for me, I have been on opioid meds daily for more than fifteen years. Take care, Annette""I am glad you are getting decent relief. So many people swear by Soma, I also like Baclofen. Take care, Annette""No, actually, I have been able to reduce it, albeit very slowly. Most recently, I have cut two of the three doses I take daily in half. Take care, Annette""Please get allergy testing to find out what you are truly allergic to, and then see a pain management specialist to see what your options are as far as drugs are concerned. Take care, Annette""Please do not give up on SSDI, they count on folks giving up. A large percentage of folks who are turned down at first are approved at a later reconsideration date, or at the judicial review level. Take care, Annette""I had my primary care doctor write a narrative letter to Social Security stating what had been done, and why, what had been figured out, and the diagnosis, what treatments had been tried, etc. It was only a page or two long. Otherwise, the doctor<APO>s office just sends copies of your entire records, useless, especially if it is in the doctor<APO>s handwriting and they cannot read it. I only wish I had known all this when I first applied. Take care, Annette""No worries, they gave me an extra name as an anonymous person once also. Take care, Annette""Please do research on this first. I read some time ago that there was no difference in outcomes when studies were done between actually cleaning out debris and making sham incisions on the knee and telling the patient the knee had been cleaned out. I did not save the article because I did not have any personal interest in knees. Take care, Annette""She should first try a higher dose of tramadol if she can take tramadol. Then move on to other drugs. A healthy adult can take up to 50 mg. at a time. She should also ask for a consultation by a pain management specialist who handles meds. Any primary care doctor will really like that request. Take care, Annette""You may need an electric mattress pad to make up the warmth that you feel with the water bed, I know I did when I switched over. I only changed because my new husband felt uncomfortable on the waterbed, I would probably still be sleeping on one. That was over 25 years ago, so it was worth it to me, I am still married to the same man!!! Take care, Annette""It sounds like you are doing the right things,at least until you see the ortho doc. Take care, Annette""I would guess that the knee that swelled up has nothing to do with the fall that injured your ankles. We<APO>re you using crutches for weight bearing on the good leg? I would keep on icing and elevating until you get in to see the orthopedic surgeon. Take care, Annette""What do you mean by ""bearing weight""? Have you seen an orthopedic surgeon yet? Take care, Annette""I would see an orthopedics. Take care, Annette""This is the wrong place to make this request. Take care, Annette""Don<APO>t ignore your doctor, explain to him any financial problems, most doctors are glad to give you alternate ways of dealing with things. No insurance company will provide this. Take care, Annette""Are you really taking 44 oxycodone a day? I hope it is a typo. Take care, Annette""Are you using the perpetual motion machine or some other type of physical therapy? Take care, Annette""A PCP is your primary care physician, so a specialist is not usually a PCP. I would find either a family practice doctor or an internist. He can refer you to a pain management specialist if necessary. Occasionally a GYN acts as the PCP for some women. If your pain is related partly to pelvic adhesions, have you asked a GYN for her opinion? I would never ask if the PCP prescribes opiates for chronic pain when I schedule the first appt. They always say no so that the drug abusers don<APO>t come flocking to their doors. I wait until I go for the initial appt, then I explain what meds I take and why and all that. I always tell them that I am prepared to wait until they get to know me and feel comfortable with me before they choose to prescribe opiates. Every doctor I have ever been to has offered by about the third appt. to write for my pain meds. Trust goes both ways, they have to be able to trust that you will take your meds properly and not sell them like your acquaintance does. They also need to make their own decision about what meds are necessary. Since you have already been off of them for two weeks, you have been through 99% of any withdrawal you are going to have, and your tolerance level has reset to that of someone who never took opiates at all. Because of this, you may require far less than you did when you stopped taking them. That is the silver lining of this dark cloud for you. Good luck in your quest. Take care, Annette""Do not feel like you are alone, you are not. You have to make sure you are not enabling him in any way. Tell him he must discuss this with his doctor. I do not know what a ""high dose"" means exactly. I use methadone because it is cheap, and oxycodone for breakthrough pain. I personally don<APO>t think the implanted nerve simulators are for me yet, but Beth uses one and is very happy with it. Take care, Annette""Talk to your doctor about what to do next. If the methadone works for you you might try just adjusting the dose. Take care, Annette""No one has ever died from opiate withdrawals alone. Find a link and post it, if you have found info to the contrary. I actually looked it up and did a search and could not find any info to support death from opiate withdrawal in a basically healthy adult. By the way, I am on good, old fashioned Medicare, and have had no trouble finding doctors to care for me. I have seen my pcp for fifteen years, and have gone to various specialists without any difficulty. This has surprised me a lot, after reading posts here. Take care, Annette""I agree about the cancer diagnosis, if it is incorrect, you need to have it removed from your medical records. It can really complicate your life. Take care, Annette PS-blessed lady ptl is not a Debbie Downer!""I would go see an orthopedic doctor outside the W/C system and pay for him yourself. Get his opinion, but don<APO>t tell him it is a W/C case. See if he tells you anything different. The one doctor did diagnose a lateral tear and tried to treat it with an injection, so they cannot really say there is nothing wrong. When I lived in Reno and wanted an important second opinion for a severe chronic problem, I went to UCSF Medical Center in San Francisco, and saw a neurologist there. You have to call and make an appt. ahead of time of course. I found him very useful and reassuring. A number of my friends and family have used them over the years for tough problems. Take care, Annette""Where did you get this information? I would like to read the studies myself, if you have links...""Social Security pays a lot less in disability payments, than this young fellow earns as a mechanic anyhow. Take it from an RN who ended up on disability, you must resign yourself to less money. When you no longer have a choice, it is easier. Take care, Annette""You did not say how long you were addicted...Please be honest with any doctor you have contact with, anyone giving you opiates will probably drug test you anyway, so they will find out. How old are you anyhow? My husband used a ""shim"" in his shoe to even out his leg lengths, one was considerably shorter than the other. He says that it helped his pain a lot. Take care, Annette""Were you using marijuana as well as taking opiates? Some docs won<APO>t prescribe opiates to folks who use medical marijuana, in my state it costs $400 to get pot legally, that is for a year and includes a medical marijuana card for the state. It is still illegal per federal law. Take care, Annette""We are all different, Charles. I had a terrible time when I took trazedone, and no problems at all with Ambien. I took Ambien for a good 15 years and tapered off without any problem at all. I was up to 15 mg. a night, I was not having any side effects, I just wanted to get off of it. Take care, Annette""I tried all the other ways to get a decent night<APO>s sleep they did not work for me. Since I am not working anymore it does not matter if I sleep or not, except I hurt more when I don<APO>t sleep. What do you suggest other than the usual sleep hygiene and cognitive therapy, which I do use successfully in other areas of my care. Take care, Annette""There is no way for anyone to tell you how you will react to any medication. You have to try it to see how it will work for you. If you do not have health insurance to help pay for meds, I would ask my doctor to write me one RX for just a few pills, and see how they work for you. If they do work, he can write a second RX for a month<APO>s worth. If they don<APO>t, you will not have spent so much money. You are currently taking the Norco incorrectly unless he actually told you to take 4-5 at a time, twice per day. That would exceed the amount of acetaminophen you should be taking per dose. My understanding is you shouldn<APO>t take more than 1,000 mg. at a time, and 4 Norco would total 1,300 mg, and 5 Norco would contain 1,625 mg. total per dose. Each Norco pill contains 325 mg. of acetaminophen. I have found over the years that if you let your pain get way out of control before you take your meds, you will end up taking more pain meds than if you treat the pain earlier on. Usually, Norco are prescribed 1-2 tablets, every four to six hours as needed, but if your doctor has different instructions, you should of course, follow his directions. What non-opiate treatments are you using for your back pain? Take care, Annette""Tell her not to complain to you anymore. You will probably need to tell her this more than once. You can be nice about this, just say that you have run out of potential solutions for her. Take care, Annette""Best of luck to you and your friend. I have had to have a similar talk with a friend of mine, not about health issues though. We have a similar discussion every few months, always via email, thank goodness. Take care, Annette""You sound great. Having more pain sucks though, some docs like to try different long acting pain meds, kind of rotate through the choices you have. Increasing the dose of the long acting med might help also. I personally use methadone, it is cheap and works well for me. Depending on what causes your pain, makes a difference in the best drug for you to try. Sorry, that last sentence was awkward at best. What I meant to say was that the cause of your pain does make a difference in your drug choices. Methadone works best for neuropathic pain, it may not be best for you. Take care, Annette""Best of luck to you, you sound like my kind of 66 year old, I am a very young 63 year old.

Opana like all opiates will cause itching, that is considered an adverse reaction without hives, but an allergic reaction with hives, like you had. It is all very confusing. Take care, Annette""What other pharmacies are you talking about? Take care, Annette""I have never been to a pharmacy where I had a problem getting opiates, Walgreens or Wal-Mart included. I was curious about who got in trouble with the feds, and why...I live in Oregon. Take care, Annette""I generally use Wal-Mart. I really think geography has a lot to do with it. Any pharmacy that gets fined, generally deserves it. If they are guilty of not documenting what they are doing, they better start. Take care, Annette""My understanding of endometriosis is that the problem is tissue that should be growing on the lining of the uterus is growing outside the uterus. This tissue expands and sloughs just like uterine lining does when you go through your cycle and have your period. Just removing the uterus with a hysterectomy, does not affect any tissue growing outside of the uterus. It is that tissue that can continue to cause pain and problems down the road. I have heard that it is very difficult to remove all the endometrial tissue with surgery as it is difficult to visualize everywhere it could be growing. I totally agree with Swank that it is far too soon after her surgery to make any decisions. It does take about a year for the body to recover from any major surgery. I had my tubes tied, and had internal bleeding bad enough that they had to go right back in and remove one ovary and tube with a large mid-line incision. It was several years for all the nerve pain to go completely away where they cut through the nerves in my abdominal wall. Take care, Annette""It might be wise for him to make an appt. with a back specialist at a teaching hospital. They are often more up to date on newer treatments and procedures. You really have not given us much information, but even with a complete medical file I would suggest he follow through with seeing a specialist. We cannot diagnose or even recommend specific treatments here. All we can do is share what we have done in similar situations or what we know other people have tried. Take care, Annette""I would get a second opinion from a neurologist, not from a surgeon. Take ALL your MRI films and xrays with you, the actual films not the reports. The radiologist reports that you get after you have an MRI or other film read are read by a radiologist who has no idea what your symptoms are or your medical history. He looks at the films and states what he thinks is going on. In my experience, it take a comprehensive medical history AND a physical examination AND labs, AND the MRI or other films all together to figure out the problem. MRIs can be read differently by different doctors, it is not the same as reading printed material. You really need to know what the patient is experiencing also to make a diagnosis. If you have one leg shorter than the other, you can get an orthotic to wear in your shoe to even the length out. I would try that and see what happens with your pain. That is the easiest, least intrusive thing to do. Did the doctor say how much shorter one leg is than the other? While you are dealing with that, I would make an appt. for with a neurologist and ask him what non-surgical treatment choices you have. Once you know all your treatment choices, you will be able to make an educated choice. Take care, Annette""Pain management doctors use a variety of techniques to treat chronic pain. Not all painful conditions can be cured or fixed with surgery. A pain management doctor treats the symptom, pain, he does not cure disease. Take care, Annette""Like Swank said there is a difference between addiction and dependence. However, if she is always zombie like, and has difficulty walking, and talking etc. she may not be taking her meds correctly, or they may be the wrong meds for her. Rather than talking about addiction, I would ask her if you can go to the doctor with her next time she goes and discuss your concerns. See what he has to offer as alternative treatments or additional treatments. My mom would have been horrified if she behaved like that and none of us kids brought it to her attention. How does your mom react when you tell her that you have noticed these things happening to her? Have you ever suggested she get a second opinion with another doctor? How did she react? Take care, Annette""The half life of valium is 20-50 hours. It is detectable in urine drug screens for at least three days. 20 mg. is not the usual prescribed dose of this drug. Is it safe to assume this is not the way it was prescribed to you, or that you were not prescribed this drug at all? This is not a drug to be taken unless it is prescribed for you, and only in the doses that your doctor recommends. Take care, Annette""If your pain is out of control on your present meds, do not call to speak to your present doctor on the phone, make an appt. and go see her. If you are sick enough to go to the ER on the weekend and get tramadol for your pain, you need to go in and see your own doctor. Take care, Annette""I am so sorry for your loss. I am afraid that this may be posted too late to help you, but just in case... It is my understanding that valium does not come in 20 mg. pills. I looked it up in my drug book to make certain. It does not list this dose at all. The maximum dose that should ever be prescribed to an adult is 20 mg. orally. Odds are that it will show up in your urine test tomorrow. If you have a contract or agreement with your pain management doctor not to take any scheduled medications, you have broken that agreement. It would be best to tell him prior to getting your urine tested. Since the drug was prescribed to you, that may mitigate things, I am not sure. Doctors hate to find these things out when the test comes back. Take care, Annette""I would consult with an Infectious Disease specialist. They are the experts about these kinds of infections. Lots of people who never had MRSA also have joint pain. Either way I would explore what it could be with the appropriate doctors and get a diagnosis. Take care, Annette""She should consult her OB doctor for this information, no one here should suggest doses for pregnant women. There may also be information on the bottle<APO>s label. Meanwhile, a nice massage by hubby might help? I have chronic pain and have found that if my hubby rubs my feet (not where it hurts) this seems to really relax me and I don<APO>t notice the pain so much. Take care, Annette""You need to go see a doctor. It may well be just a strain, but it could also be something else. No one here can make a diagnosis for you. Meanwhile you might try heat instead of ice to see if that makes it feel better. Take care, Annette""The episode is over now, I would do what I could to prevent it from happening again. All pain mad contracts I have seen say that lost or stolen pills will not be replaced. Never keep your meds in the bathroom. That is the first place people go to steal them. Besides the heat and the moisture in the air is bad for meds. I don<APO>t even keep over the counter pills there. You should always keep your meds in a locked box, and hide the box somewhere where visitors do not go like your bedroom closet. It is better to have them stolen than to have a visiting child take them and die. Changing doctors within the same group probably would not change anything, most group practices have the same rules set up for everyone in the group. If you have not had any problems with this doctor in the past, I would just go on with him. This incident will show him that you can be trusted, you got a police report, and carried on through the time you were out of meds. If you feel strongly that you want to change doctors, I would make appts. with a couple of options (outside of the present group practice) and see them in person prior to alerting the present doctor that you may be switching. If you find a good doctor for you, then you can notify the old doctor. If you don<APO>t, no harm done, and no hurt feelings. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I don<APO>t know anything about individual insurance companies and policies. All you can do is call the insurance company and ask them if they cover a second opinion outside that group. Take care, Annette""My understanding is that SS does not base disability on your diagnosis, but on what you are able and unable to actually do. Try and get your doctor to document in your medical record just how long you can sit, stand, and walk, how much you can lift and carry and how often. How often you need to take a break, and how long the break needs to be, etc. How well you respond to pain meds, and what side effects would also affect your disability. I hope you have an experienced lawyer to help you with this. Take care, Annette""If I knew I got extreme sea sickness, I would pass on any sea voyages, lol. As far as medicine interactions, I would try them together when I was safe at home under my doctor<APO>s supervision first to see how they work together. Take care, Annette""Every drug works slightly differently for different people. I assume by bp you mean back pain? Usually, the doctor starts with about half the equianalgesic doses from a opioid comparison chart when switching from one opioid to another in a tolerant person. This is because there is only a partial cross tolerance between opioids, so if you took a completely equianalgesic dose you could overdose. Then you work up slowly depending on how much pain you are having. Sometimes the first dose works just fine. Using short acting breakthrough meds should help manage your pain through the transition. Take care, Annette""I always start with my primary care doctor. If she and I can<APO>t figure things out, she will recommend a specialist for me to consult. Take care, Annette""Call Ameritox and ask them why you might have had a false positive result. Let them know all the meds you are currently taking. Sometimes the meds you take break down into metabolites and show up as other drugs. They will have this information. If your current doctor is not concerned, and you are only getting a new doctor because he is leaving, he may know about this already. Ask him what he thinks. Take care, Annette""I personally believe that if you have any kind of chronic illness, then moving must be approached differently than for other healthy people. We need to check out the medical care before we move, find new doctors, insurance, etc. Now that you are there, that advice does little to help you. Please call Goodwill, Salvation Army, Catholic Charities, etc. and ask if there are any free or low cost clinics where you now live. They are in many communities now, but rarely advertise their presence. You can also go on line and Google free clinics in your area. Clearly, your child is the most important thing to you, if nothing else you can take her to the local ER for care. After you get the bill, call the hospital<APO>s business office and ask them if they offer any indigent care and how you can apply for help. They will often give you a discount or help you arrange a payment plan. I doubt the doctors in your present state will accept the medical card from your former state, but call them and ask. Take care, Annette""You can also do a Google search online to find free clinics, I do it for friends. I just put free clinics and the name of the city, state in the Google box and do the search. Volunteers In Medicine run a bunch of low cost clinics all over the country, you can Google them also. Take care, Annette""This is a question for your doctor. Did the ultracet work for you? If it did your doctor may be willing to call in a RX for some more to your pharmacy. Often doctors prescribe small amounts at first to see how well we will do on them. Take care, Annette""I have a history of migraines and I occasionally get what I call ice pick pains in my head. They are fast, stabbing, severe pains that shoot through my head and are gone in seconds. Other folks I have met with migraines also describe these kinds of pains. No one ever mentioned to me that they lasted up to an hour at a time. You need to see your doctor and let him know what is going on. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t think anyone meant to insult your intelligence at all. Many people come here with misinformation about the difference between addiction and dependence. Your description of going from dependence to addiction when the cause of the pain is cured is also inaccurate. Needing more of the drug to get the same result is also not addiction, it is called tolerance and is a normal reaction to opiates, one just adjusts the dose accordingly. My husband was on a steady dose of methadone for hip pain for two years until he was finally able to have his hip replaced. His pain went away and he tapered off of the methadone without any withdrawal symptoms at all. He did not go to detox, support groups or anything like that. He simply tapered off and continued to go to work as usual. An addiction is a psychological problem, it is the use of a drug for other than its prescribed purpose, in spite of the negative consequences to ones life. If you took the pain meds to get high, rather than to treat your pain, that would be a symptom of addiction. If you continued to do so even though it meant stealing drugs, or lying to doctors to get them, being busted for DUI, etc. those would be negative consequences. I would just suggest you use whatever medical treatment you need to relieve your pain while you search for an answer. I don<APO>t push the use of opiates on anyone who would rather not use them, but I think everyone should have accurate information about any treatment before they make the decision NOT to use it. The medical studies done so far have shown that only about 5% of the people who use opiates develop an addiction. Those studies include recovering addicts who use opiates for pain and relapse. The research I have done shows that even recovering addicts can use opiates safely and not develop addiction relapses. 5% is a low percentage for side effects. Now, all that aside, the only thing that seems to make any difference with your pain seems to be related to your left kidney. I would try a teaching hospital urology clinic and see if they see anything else that can be fixed. It is not a matter of having better doctors there than you have already seen, it is a matter of having new eyes looking at the symptoms and maybe coming up with a new treatment plan. Take care, Annette""There are lots more different meds to try before you give up on them. You only mentioned three. There are also non-drug options as far as treatment goes. I think your doctor is going down the right track as far as meds and tests. Once the MRI is done, you will have more information. Take care, Annette""Sweating, nausea, and headaches are included as side effects of these drugs in my drug handbook. It is common for those kinds of side effects to go away with time. I did not find any mention of ringing in the ears as a side effect of either drug. The most common drug that causes ringing in the ears is aspirin, I don<APO>t know if you have been taking any of that also. I would mention the ringing in the ears to the doctor the next time you see him and see what he says. Constipation is a common side effect of opiate pain meds, including the dilaudid you are taking. Increasing your fiber and water intake, and getting some form of exercise (with your doctor<APO>s okay) are the first things to try. You may also take a stool softener, and/or a stimulant type laxative as needed to move your bowels. Don<APO>t allow yourself to get so constipated that you go a week without moving your bowels, especially if that makes you uncomfortable. Constipation can cause nausea, and other symptoms of discomfort. You can ask your doctor for a bowel care program to prevent constipation. This is something that you may need to do as long as you are on the medications. It is a side effect that usually does not go away unless you stop taking the pain meds. Take care, Annette""This is a question that he needs to ask his doctor or pharmacist. I was on coumadin for six months and managing pain became the most difficult part of using this drug. I had depended on NSAIDs for years for pain and could no longer use them. I also could not use quite a number of herbals and supplements. Take care, Annette""So, what is it? Only a doctor can make a diagnosis, and only by seeing the patient in person and doing an examination and whatever testing is appropriate. RA is only one of many things that can cause joint pain. Take care, Annette""I am so happy for you. SSDI is not much, but it is money you can count on getting every month, and you certainly deserve it. It is an insurance program that we pay into and we should be able to use it more easily when we need it. I got mine a bit over ten years ago. One thing that many people don<APO>t know is that it is common to get depressed right after it all hits you. I know I did, I hated that the judge agreed that I was unable to work. I guess I was hoping for some kind of miracle. The depression lasted a couple of months, then began easing up. I used cognitive behavioural therapy techniques to help me get past that. Keep bugging the SSA office so they get your checks coming. I called every week to ask how mine were progressing. Some guy there finally told me they had an emergency program that would at least get you up to $10,000 of your back pay sooner rather than later. I did that, and they gave me all my back pay, closer to $25,000. So, if you need it in a hurry, ask them if they have any kind of emergency program that will help you. Hugs, Annette""If you post your concerns about how to use the board on the Technical Board, along with the kind of browser and operating system you use, the techies there will explain things to you. They will also tell you how to change your screen name. I use the email digest system, so I really don<APO>t know how the board works these days. I switched over to the digests because I didn<APO>t like the board changes, I thought they made it more difficult to use. You could ask about that also. Take care, Annette""I know it could be worse for me, so I just am thankful that I am where I am. I have found volunteer work to be very useful in keeping me up and going. I meet people, and stay productive that way since I can no longer work. I have found that men handle things differently than women do, they want to fix things, we seem to want to talk way more than they are comfortable with. The fact that your hubby does most of the household chores is huge, I suspect that is his way of being supportive. I would be happy to have that. I rarely talk about my aches and pains with my hubby, he knows I hurt. He rubs my feet when things are really bad, he knows that helps me relax and sleep better. He never bugs me about not doing chores, and his last words as he leaves for work are always, ""You get some rest today. I love you."" Everyone has down days, but if you find you can<APO>t get yourself out of a slump, get some help. A good therapist who knows how to use cognitive behavioral therapy can do wonders. You can learn to better manage the down days on your own. Take care, Annette""Sorry, but 120/65 is not low blood pressure, it is about normal. If you stay on the blood pressure meds they may also help your migraines, they often do. Some blood pressure meds are used to treat migraines in many people with normal blood pressure. You need to check your blood pressure at least once a week for several weeks to get an idea of how high it runs. High blood pressure is called the ""Silent Killer"" because you get no symptoms until you get the heart attach, stroke, or kidney failure that follows it. It is normal to have no energy the day after a migraine, and it would seem wise to try and stay on a medicine long enough to see if it works, and if any side effects stick with you. Side effects often go away after a couple of weeks. I would discuss this with your doctor and get all the info before making a decision. Taking ibuprofen like candy is not good for you either. Ibuprofen can have serious side effects over time including ulcers that bleed massively. The other problem with taking ibuprofen for migraines is that if you take it more than about three days per week, it can trigger rebound headaches. From what you posted you may already be there. Lyrica is a seizure med that is also used to treat fibromyalgia and some kinds of chronic pain. Other seizure meds are also used off label to treat migraines. I take neurontin, a close chemical relative of Lyrica, and my migraines have decreased in frequency and severity. I take it for chronic pain. I am not aware of it being used for bipolar disorder, but I am no pharmacist. You might try calling your pharmacist and ask him questions about any meds you are unsure of. Only your doctor knows why he is suggesting you take it, why don<APO>t you just ask him more questions about all of this. Write down the questions you have and take the list to your next appt. Take care, Annette""Thanks, Caprice. I just got home from a week out of town, and responded via email. I would love to participate. Take care, Annette""I got an email from WebMD in regard to a Community Health Ambassador program. It asked for my full name, mailing address, and telephone number. I am interested, but this was unsolicited and I don<APO>t give out personal info without checking it out first. Anyhow, I responded via email without including my address and phone number. I wanted to check it out first and make sure it is legit. If you could let me know please??? Thanks, Annette""I<APO>m back home. No, grandbabies this trip. My best friends<APO> mom passed away in March, and we had an estate sale and one last visit in her old house in Calif. with all of us there. I have known this family for fifty years now, so it was bittersweet. By the time I came home, we were all sleeping on mattresses on the floor, the only stuff we hadn<APO>t sold was the kitchen table and chairs and enough kitchen stuff for us to get by on. The house will need one last clean up before selling it. It was great for the three sisters and I to spend some time together. Who knows when we will all be in one place at the same time again. One sister lives in Florida, and two in Calif. but not near each other. I am so lucky to have all my friends, including all you on-line friends. Take care, Annette""I will be out of town for a week starting Thursday. No computers when I go out of town, I take a break from it all, lol. So, no worries, will be back tomorrow night, then not until next week. Take care, Annette""I used to get migraines early in the mornings, they were also one sided headaches. Scans are to check for tumors and that sort of thing, they are always negative for migraines, they are done to rule out the bad, dangerous stuff. A negative scan is good news, but does not rule out migraines or other types of headaches that won<APO>t kill you. He should go back to the doctor and ask to see a headache specialist. If he IS seeing a headache specialist, he should go back and describe the headaches and ask for treatment. There are very good treatments available in the way of daily medications to prevent these kinds of headaches, or to take only when they come on to make them go away. Good luck to you both. Take care, Annette""Sorry, I have been out of town for a week, so this may have all been worked out by now. You really need to discuss all of your concerns with his doctors. I would suggest writing them all down and taking the list with you and the older folks, along with a pad and pen to write down the answers. Opiates and some other meds can cause urinary retention and constipation. Those in turn can cause a urinary infection, which could cause high fevers and delusional behavior in elderly people. But I do not know if this is the case in his situation. Serotonin syndrome can also cause high fevers. It is caused by taking more than one medication that causes an increase in the serum serotonin levels. Since you do not recall all of his meds, this would also be something to discuss with his doctors. Opiates and benzos (like Xanax) separately, but also together, can cause respiratory depression, one may breathe more shallowly and more slowly while taking them. This can lead to pneumonia in some patients. The drugs don<APO>t cause the pneumonia, but they set the patient up for developing it. Pneumonia can also cause fever, delusional behavior and other respiratory problems, so that would explain why they wanted him to decrease the meds. Pneumonia may include bacteria, so antibiotics may or may not be part of the treatment. Your mom should follow any kind of fever control program the doctor suggested. Fever alone can cause delusional behavior in some people if it is high enough. Keep track of when and how much he urinates. People who retain urine may have what we call overflow urination, where their bladder is full but the do urinate small amounts without ever totally emptying their bladder. Urinary retention is very uncomfortable. Please, please take all these concerns to his primary care doc as well as his specialists. Take care, Annette""Call her back and ask her. No way for any of us to diagnose you on line. Take care, Annette""An EEG should tell the doctors if you in fact have any kind of epilepsy at all. I don<APO>t think an EEG will diagnose the other things you mentioned. They are considered psychiatric diagnsoses. I assume you have a psychiatrist prescribing all your meds for these things??? We all learn differently, I wrote notes all the time in school and in my daily life because I am a visual learner as opposed to an auditory learner. I rarely ever went back and read the notes, because once I saw them written down as I wrote them, I usually remembered them. Now, I am older and refer to the notes more often. Perhaps I had hypergraphia and just never knew it, or perhaps your condition is much more severe. Since at least some of the meds make you more able to function, I am not sure why you would want to get off of all of them. Are you doing any other type of therapy to lessen your dependence on the meds? I would try cognitive behavioral therapy and other types of talk therapy to try and fix or lessen some of your psychiatric problems, you may be able to take less meds that way. Please do not turn to alcohol, as that only increases all your problems and it should not be mixed with your other meds. See your psychiatrist and discuss these concerns with him/her. Please don<APO>t change any meds on your own, or on the advice of folks online. Take care, Annette""You can use additional page(s) if the six lines allowed doesn<APO>t give you enough space. Be complete. If you are an RN, document this like you would document an incident report at work. Be complete. Take care, Annette""Swank is correct, prednisone can have terrible side effects when used long term. That said, I used it also for spinal problems when I had a flare up of symptoms. I never took it for longer than two weeks and never more than a couple of times a year, but used like that can be a miracle drug. I got relief within a few days, and it often lasted for months and months. Take care, Annette""It all depends on what your symptoms are and what your doctor is looking for. Take care, Annette""Who knows what it is? Go see your family doctor first, if you and he can<APO>t figure it out, he can refer you to an appropriate specialist. Take care, Annette""Opiates cause constipation by decreasing the activity of the intestinal walls that push food through your intestine. Some people believe that stool softeners help them enough to avoid constipation, some people believe that only using a stimulant type laxative will help. Some people use both. If stool softeners are enough to help you avoid constipation, wait until you see your doctor when he comes back to discuss this with him. If they are not working for you, and you are constipated now, you could speak to your pharmacist while you wait for your doctor to come back. Take care, Annette""In my experience as an ER nurse, the doctors give out very small amounts of pain meds per RX, often only 10-12 pills. It sounds like your own doctor doesn<APO>t give oyu narcotics because you told him you didn<APO>t want them. I would be more concerned about the valium you are taking than the vicodin as far as addiction. Benzos really scare me, I have seen some bad benzo addicts who became addicts on legal RXs. If you take valium, ambien and vicodin all at once, you should be feeling really good mentally even if you still had pain. They all work together to give a sense of euphoria. Many pain maangement doctors won<APO>t prescribe valium and opiates together for one patient. Take care, Annette""You have to use your head, if you have several drugs and you know they all cause euphoric, sedating type feelings, and each is ordered ""as needed"", it does not mean you have to take all three at once. According to your long posts, you have a lot of painful conditions, and long experience with all these things. I would know before I took all three of those together, that if I did I would probably get stoned, or at least feel really good. Also, my doctor and I have an agreement, as do many chronic pain patients and their prescribing doctors, that I will NOT get meds from anyone except her, especially controlled substances. If I did, she would have reason to discharge me from her care. If I got valium, ambien, vicodin, and xanax from different doctors, she would discharge me from her practice at once, and I would be hunting for another doctor and unlikely to find one. You keep saying you told doctors you didn<APO>t want the vicodin, all you had to do was not take the RX out of their hand. My hubby had his pain managed by his pcp, and when his surgeon tried to give him another RX for percocet in addition to his regular meds after his hip was replaced, he just did not accept the RX, he told the surgeon that his pcp would continue to manage all of his pain as usual. ""Thanks anyway"". That was the end of that. I worked in ERs for over 15 years, and I have never seen an ER doc try to force opiates on anyone. If you go to the ER complaining of pain, it is the ER doc<APO>s job to make sure you don<APO>t have anything dangerous going on, and to help with your pain. They don<APO>t hand out enough opiate pills to get anyone in trouble. They do not put anyone on long term narcotics that require monitoring, they leaves that up to your own doctor to do. I would not go to the ER because I got hit by an automatic door, or an elevator door, I would call my doctor and go see her at her office. Going to the ER is a personal choice, and I choose only to go in true emergencies. Some people are forced to use the ER by circumstances. Just because an ER doctor offered you opiates for an acute injury, does not mean your own doctor needs to continue them indefinitely. My guess as to why your own doctor refuses to give you vicodin long term, even though the ER doctor does offer it to you for short term use, is that your own doctor DOES know you better, and he has a reason why he feels uncomfortable doing it. You should simply ask him. As you say he does know you and your history intimately. I am always happy to answer any questions from my personal experience, and to look up stuff in the reference books I have at home. I tend to be frank though, so if you really don<APO>t want to know what I think, don<APO>t ask me, lol. Take care of yourself. Annette""If you are taking advil daily, that could be causing rebound headaches that occur daily. If the advil isn<APO>t working, I wouldn<APO>t take it, too many bad side effects including daily headaches and possible stomach problems. If you haven<APO>t seen pain management specialists, I would try that. Take care, Annette""Laudanum is known to the medical community as tincture of opium. It is raw opium, mashed and mixed with alcohol, then the liquid is drawn off and medically calibrated and used orally for diarrhea and pain according to my drug book and on line references. You can<APO>t be ""shot up..."" with it, as it is not available in injection form, at least not in the US. I assume you got some other medication, perhaps morphine, if you reside in the US. I think perhaps there is more to this story than what you have posted. I agree with Gail, you need to ask for pain relief, not a specific drug. If you want help with pain, then be open to ALL treatment modalities, not just Vicodin. Take care, Annette""I would suggest you ask your pcp if she has any suggestions as to what she can do for you, or what kinds of doctors she may be able to refer you to. Take the insurance company<APO>s list of providers with you so she can look at it. Some neurologists manage headaches and also manage pain. My pcps have managed my pain for most of the years I have had chronic pain, about 20 years total. One was a family practice doctor and the other two were internal medicine doctors. Take care, Annette""I am sure Charles will respond also. Meanwhile, here is my suggestion, talk to your doctor, let him know that the Norco are no longer working and that you would like to try something else in addition to them. I always ask in relation to the activities that my pain keeps me from doing. I don<APO>t ask for drugs, I ask for enough relief to continue my volunteer work and household activities There are a number of long acting oral opiates that you can take on a set schedule and just use the Norco as your breakthrough med. You should not have to take so many per day once you get your doses adjusted properly. In addition to oxycontin, there is long acting morphine, methadone, and levorphanol just off the top of my head. I think there is one other long acting med that I can<APO>t think of the name right now, Opana maybe??? The zombie like feeling that you describe is usually from too high a dose, adjusting the dose downwards will often fix this. Also side effects like sedation, nausea, and itching usually do go away after a few weeks on the medicine. Constipation is a side effect that usually continues on once it begins, you have to work out a bowel care program to handle it. I do not know what other meds you are on, but I have found that gabapentin is a good med for me to use to help control my pain. It is an anti-seizure med that is also used for chronic pain. Other anti-seizure meds are also used for chronic pain management. Some antidepressants are also used for chronic pain because they mediate the neurotransmitters that carry the pain signals to your brain. Be prepared to try some of these types of meds in addition to opiates if you have not already. I would not ask for anything by name, just leave that up to the doctor. Be sure to keep all your meds locked securely away so no one gets into them. Take care, Annette""Post-concussive head injuries have been studied much more since the vets have started coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. They can cause a lot of neurological issues. Do a search and print out the info you find on reliable medical sites. Take these to your doctor to discuss. I am not sure why you have not mentioned all the concussions you have had to your neurologists, but I believe you should do so. Pick one doctor and keep going back and tell him how you are doing. Even if anxiety is causing your problems, you should be treated appropriately for that. Have you seen a neurologist who deals with sports injuries? He might be more understanding of multiple head injuries in young people. Take care, Annette""Please break up your posts into paragraphs if you want everyone to read them, I don<APO>t expect perfect grammar or spelling, but when the entire, long post is one big, run on sentence like this one, I personally skip it and go on to the next one. It is too difficult to read this way. Of course, it is entirely up to the individual writing the post. Take care, Annette""Sorry, you can<APO>t take any long acting opiate pills because none of them can be safely crushed and taken via a PEG tube. When you crush long acting opiates, you eliminate the long acting delivery system and get all the drug at once, risking an overdose. Your doctor has probably already explained this to you. You can also crush percocet or immediate acting plain oxycodone, but that only lasts 4-6 hours. It is another short acting opiate. There are a couple of other short acting nacoticss that can be crushed, but they won<APO>t help you either. The only long term opiate that I am aware of that you could use is the fentanyl patch that you apply to your skin. This patch would need to be replaced every 48-72 hours depending on how you respond to it. The drug is absorbed directly from the patch through your skin and into your blood stream. Take care, Annette""My doctor did a vitamin D and vitamin B12 level years ago, before they became so popular. Low levels of either one can cause neuropathic pain. She is smart, however my tests were all within normal limits. I have heard a lot of talk about this, but I actually met anyone who had a FMS diagnosis who was cured when they took vit. D. Many Americans develop vit. D deficiencies because they stay out of the sun or wear sunscreen whenever they go out. About 15-20 min. of sunshine on your face and arms is enough for most people to make plenty of vit. D. Of course, you should not get that sunshine in the middle of the afternoon, don<APO>t want to get skin cancer, lol. It is an easy blood test to have done along with your regular blood work. If you are one of those people with a low level it is easy to take a supplement. Take care, Annette""My understanding of the diagnosis of FMS is that it must include widespread pain above and below the waist on both sides of the body in at least three of the four quadrants of the body. This pain must last more than three months. You also need to have 11 positive out of 18 tender points. Tender points and trigger points are DIFFERENT things. Some doctors will make a tentative FMS diagnosis with fewer than 11 tender points, but you do have to have positive tender points to have FMS. I have never read anything about the pain needing to be symmetrical for FMS. Lastly, the pain and other symptoms cannot be due to another illness, so they usually do a lot of tests to make sure you don<APO>t have RA, osteoarthritis, thyroid problems, hepatitis, HIV, Lupus, etc. Vit. B12 and Vit D can also cause pain if you are lacking adequate levels of either of them. Once everything else is ruled out, if you meet the criteria you would be diagnosed with FMS. The best medical site I have found about FMS is www.myalgia.com. It is not interactive, but has a lot of good medical information about FMS and its treatment. You might go do some reading there. Take care, Annette""I am not sure I was the person you were asking, but here is my experience. I also have migraines, and spinal problems in my neck that I have had one surgery for. Savella is a NSRI, it affects the norepinephrine far more than it affects the serotonin, but it is very similar to Cymbalta, and Effexor. Savella was approved for FMS specifically, the others are antidepressants that have also been found to be useful for chronic pain in many people. Unfortunately, they do not work for me. I haven<APO>t taken any of those types of drugs in many years, they made my symptoms worse. Cymbalta worked well for my husband when he was being treated for chronic pain. Once his hip was replaced, he tapered off of those meds without any problem. I don<APO>t tell others not to try them though. Like my husband and I, we all react differently to meds, what works for me may not work for you, and what works for you, may not work for me. Antiseizure meds are also used for FMS, if the Savella does not work and you want to try something else you can discuss that with your doctor. Remember, that FMS is usually a life long illness, so do your best to keep the opiates as low as you can for as long as you can. Many doctors get uncomfortable with higher doses and don<APO>t like prescribing them. Go read at www.myalgia.com. There is lots of good material there about FMS. Take care, Annette""Thanks for the link, I read her book. I don<APO>t really believe in all the stuff she says. But, if her style works for you, go for it. We all need to decide for ourselves what path to take. Take care, Annette""From what I have read, Savella affects the same neurotransmitters (seotonin and epinephrine) as Effexor and Cymbalta. That class of antidepressants never helped me, neither did any of the other antidepressants for that matter. I don<APO>t bother with them at all anymore. I use gabapentin, the generic of Neurontin, an anti-seizure medicine. It does help me in addition to taking opiates. You might discuss that with your doctor. It is very similar to Lyrica but it is available in generic so it is much cheaper. Lyrica did not work for me. It is normal for FMS pain to hurt more in the morning and evening, with some improvement in the afternoon. Take care, Annette""For 99% of the time since I was diagnosed, I have seen my primary care doc for FMS care. One year, I saw a rheumatologist that I liked a lot. But, then I moved away and found another pcp. She has been great. I really don<APO>t think it is necessary to see a rheumatologist for FMS if you have a good pcp with an interest in managing your illness. For the fatigue, I pace myself carefully. I do 15-20 min. of chores, then 15-20 minutes of rest. Mostly, I just push through it. I plan rest days as needed if I know I will be really busy, traveling, etc. Take care, Annette PS- Try reading at www.myalgia.com for lots of good FMS medical information.""Try looking it up under milnaciprin, I think that is the generic name. I believe it is advertised directly for an FMS diagnosis for FMS pain, rather than as an antidepressant that is also used for FMS. But my understanding is that it is a SNRI, and it has the same warnings about suicidal ideation as other antidepressants in the same class of drugs. It is fairly new, was approved by the FDA recently. Take care, Annette""Actually, Savella was developed and tested for FMS pain, and is approved for such by the FDA. It works on the norepinephrine neurotransmitter far more than serotonin. In that way it is chemically different than Cymbalta, although I am not sure it would make any difference clinically because I have never taken it. They claim it does work better for FMS pain because of this difference. Savella is taken on a set schedule unlike Percocet which is only taken as needed. This is kind of like comparing apples and oranges, because they are completely different classes of drugs used in a different way, although both are used for pain. I agree with you that there are other stronger pain meds that may work better for moderate to severe pain. That said, I think it is better to try non-opiate meds first, and save the opiates for pain that does not respond to other meds. Those of us with FMS will probably have it for our whole lives and it seems better to me to save the opiates for as long as possible (as we may develop tolerance to them), until we have tried the other treatment alternatives. Some folks may be able to put off the onset of opiate use for a few years, other won<APO>t. Many doctors are hesitant to prescribe large doses of opiates, even though there does not seem to be evidence that they are more dangerous in opiate tolerant patients. This is just a fact of life for many people, so starting on opiates sooner may put us at that point of dosing sooner. There are lots of interesting points of view when comparing pain management with completely different classes of drugs. Take care, Annette""I read one reference that calls Savella the first NSRI rather than a SNRI because it affects norepinephrine more than it does serotonin. I have not read any head to head studies of this drug vs. a traditional SNRI when used for chronic pain due to FMS. If anyone else has, I would love a link so I can go read it for myself. Take care, Annette""I would discuss it with your liver doctor first. If your pain is primarily from the Hep C treatment, a facet rhizotomy may not be of any use. Your liver doctor should be aware of any kinds of long lasting pain from those medications and how best to treat it. My husband had interferon treatment for cancer and he had pain from it for a long time, but it finally resolved. I have no idea what a ""non-surgical neurosurgeon"" is. A neurosurgeon is a surgeon. Before getting this kind of treatment, I would get two opinions from doctors in different medical practices. See what they say and compare notes. Also find out what your non-surgical treatment options are. Why does your doctor want you off of the oxycodone? Have your doses been escalating without improvement of your pain? Are you having side effects? Are you very young? Do you have a history of addiction? Have you requested early refills? Ask him what his reasoning is. Take care, Annette""Long acting opiates are taken on a set schedule rather than on an ""as needed"" basis. The schedule depends on the medicine and on the individual. Some of the long acting opiates include Oxycontin (the long acting form of oxycodone that you already take), levorphanol, and methadone. Long acting morphine is available in several formulas MS Contin and its generics are scheduled every 8-12 hours, Avinza and Kadian are also morphine and are usually taken every 12-24 hours. The dose is adjusted gradually until you have pretty acceptable pain control most of the day. There is also the fentanyl patch. It is a skin patch that you stick on and the medicine is absorbed through your skin over time. The patch is changed every 48-72 hours depending on the patient. Then it is nice to have a short acting opiate available for breakthrough pain due to extra activity or just extra pain that you may have. Most of us also take other meds to help control our pain, things like anti-seizure meds or antidepressants, Lidoderm patches, etc. There are also the non-drug pain management treatment techniques. I use them depending on what is going on at any given time. Heat, ice, massage, biofeedback, PT, OT, acupuncture, TENS unit, etc. Because you already take a cocktail of meds for your bipolar disorder, I would include your psychiatrist in the planning stage of treatment. There may be some pain meds that would work better with your current meds than others would. I would not discuss pain management with an orthopedic surgeon, they are not trained in pain management of chronic pain. There are pain management specialists that deal with those kinds of medicines. Ask a doctor you trust for a referral. I would discuss this with your pcp or your psychiatrist. A great book for managing pain is called ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"" by Dr. Margaret A. Caudill, MD, PhD. You can order it on line or at one of the bookstore chains. Take care, Annette""I was reading your posts and Charles<APO> reply. A comprehensive pain management clinic will provide all of the options including the more invasive ones, but usually the least invasive are tried first. There are also pain management clinics that do mostly procedures and injections and avoid using oral meds or all the other less invasive measures. Perhaps that is what they are trained for, or perhaps they get better financial reimbursement for procedures and injections than they do for office visits to discuss meds and physical therapies. I prefer the more comprehensive clinics also. I feel that if you get a small amount of relief from each of several kinds of non-invasive treatments, the total amount of relief can be worthwhile. I would not consent to invasive things until all else had failed. Just my preference. I would fly to the doctor three and a half hours away if possible, at least for a consultation to see if you are on the right track. I did that when I lived in Reno and wanted to see a neurologist at UC San Francisco. It was worth it. Take care, Annette""Gail gave you lots of good advice. The dynamics of methadone use by addicts is completely different than those by a chronic pain patient. There may be a huge difference between 50 mg. and 50 ml. depending on what the concentration of the liquid is. Mg. is the official dose of the medicine, ml. is just how much liquid she is taking (it is usually mixed in water or a flavored drink). If it is a high concentration (large amount of med to fluid), she would be taking more than if it were a low concentration (smaller amount of med to fluid). I have a huge problem with anyone who stockpiles meds and tries to wean off without telling her doctor. All methadone clinics are happy to taper someone off properly, you just ask them to. Methadone is dirt cheap even with no insurance, so her comment that it is expensive gives me pause. The clinic charges her additionally for its services, but then she needs those services. She needs some kind of addict support via NA or a psychiatrist. All that said, my friend was on 40 mg. methadone for chronic pain and decreased it by about 5 mg. per day each week, and had no withdrawal symptoms at all. Everyone is different. Withdrawal is not my concern in her case, relapsing and going back to addictive use of opiates is. It is nice of you to try and help her, but the real answer to helping her is to tell her to taper off according to the clinics rules and procedures. To be honest with them. Take care, Annette""Yes, I have FMS too. I was diagnosed back in 1995, had had symptoms for about six months. I was blessed with a good doctor who picked up on it quickly. I had spinal surgery in 1992, C5-6 discectomy. I tried lyrica but it didn<APO>t do any better than the neurontin I had already tried so I went back to that. No side effects though. I was on klonopin many years ago for migraines, would never go back on that or any other benzo again. I lost memory of about three months and finally rolled my car. Thank God no one was hurt. I was only taking a small dose at bedtime, I don<APO>t know how people take it during the day. It has a very long half life, so it builds up in your system. It just goes to show how differently we all respond to meds. Take care, Annette""Even people with addiction in their past/present sometimes need pain management. However, opioids may not always be the best choice. You can<APO>t be ""relatively honest"", that is like being kind of pregnant, lol. You need to be absolutely clear to your doctors that you have a really hard time with craving the high you sometimes get from your meds, and that you sometimes give in to that craving. Let them know you are seeking treatment for this. You need to start attending NA meetings or some other type of treatment for your addictive behaviour. You know you are an addict, so you KNOW you need treatment if you are caving in to your cravings. Switching to methadone may work well for you. Since it is long acting, you don<APO>t get the high that one often gets with short acting meds. But, you can kill yourself trying to get high by taking extra pills, so please trust me on this. It must be taken exactly as prescribed, doctors start with a low dose and increase it very slowly until you get pain relief. Be prepared to tolerate your pain for a few weeks while you find the right dose. I used to work as an RN in a methadone clinic for addicts. Methadone is commonly used for pain management in my area, even primary care doctors prescribe it. ""The Massachusetts General Hospital Handbook of Pain Management"" is a worthwhile book for anyone requiring long term pain management. It suggests anyone with a past history of addiction be treated by an addiction specialist as well as a pain management specialist if they use opioids for pain management. You may have to get your addiction under better control before a doctor feels comfortable giving you more opioids. Take care, Annette""Talaine stated that she sometimes uses her meds to get high, she also said she has had other addict type behaviors. Why is it so hard to just accept what she says? Opiates in higher doses or stronger types are not the right answer for everyone. Fentanyl patches may or may not be the right med for her, but I think it is far more important for her to be honest with her provider about her cravings and her own inability to cope with them. He and she together can assess how severe the risk of addiction is for her far better than we can. Addiction is a very difficult disease to treat successfully, the earlier treatment occurs the better. I wish her the best in dealing with both her chronic pain and any addiction problems she may have. Take care, Annette Take care, Annette""I am a nurse who worked at a methadone clinic for treating heroin addicts way back in the 1970s when it was considered experimental for that use. Both methadone and suboxone are legal substitutes for illegal opiates. They simply buy the client time to work on his/her addiction. That way they can identify and change their addictive behaviours without worrying about going into withdrawal. The goal is to get a good hold on recovery before tapering off of the methadone or suboxone. The reason some people come in with briefcases for their take home doses is because they are required to have a container that locks for safety reasons. EVERYONE should have a place to lock up all their medicines if there are strangers or children in their homes. Someone posted here last year about a neighbor who stole her opiates out of her nightstand and committed suicide by taking them all an hour later. Sad. Take care, Annette""I have a list in the back of my drug handbook, so I have never looked for one on line. If you are in pain 24/7, then you likely need a long acting med that you take on a set schedule. These are all schedule II meds. The long acting med should take care of most of your pain. If you have breakthrough pain in spite of that med, you would take a short-acting med like Norco as needed when that happens. The doctor usually tells you just how many of these pills you may take during a month. You really don<APO>t need a list, the doctor will choose your meds according to what he believes you need for your type of pain. The main difference is that you have to have an actual paper prescription for schedule II meds for each month you take them. They cannot be called in or faxed in to the pharmacy. Schedule III meds can be called in by the doctor<APO>s office. My doctor lets us pick up the paper RX at the office without having an appt. with her, I do see her regularly to assess how I am doing. I would imagine you could find a list of scheduled meds by doing a search on Google??? Take care, Annette""Glad to see you are doing better all in all. 20 mg. Oxycontin is a really low dose, taken three times a day that is only a total of 60 mg. per day. I would move up on the dose myself and try that, but that is just my opinion. Switching from oxycontin to percocet does not change the opioid you are using, so the whole thing about avoiding tolerance does not apply to switching from a time released form to a short acting form. When they talk about rotating meds to avoid tolerance, they are talking about changing meds completely, like from oxycodone to morphine. Dilaudid is a shortacting med, in my professional experience it really only lasts a couple of hours. I would not recommend it for anything but acute pain. You are also on different meds now, so you need to look at the interaction of all the different meds you take. Mixing opiates with benzos and Straterra may be tricky. I would discuss this with a trusted pharmacist or the doctor who prescribes the ADD meds. Make certain all your doctors know all the meds you are taking and are aware of the interactions. You might let a trusted friend or family member know you are adjusting your meds so they can let you know if you have any personality changes that you may not even be aware of. Glad things are working out for you. Take care, Annette""The doctor who ordered the MRI should explain just what it means to you. What the record says is what the radiologist sees on the film, he has no idea what your past medical history is. Your doctor looks at the MRI and adds his knowledge of your medical history and present symptoms to come up with a diagnosis. Talk to your doctor. Take care, Annette""I understand you feeling a need to overlap your patches, but since doctors are hard to find that prescribe opioids in your area, I would use them exactly the way the doctor prescribes them. Do your own research and take it to the kind doctor who is currently giving you the patches. If you run out early, or otherwise get yourself into trouble, he may stop prescribing them to you at all. Take care, Annette""Toradol is a NSAID so it also hit the cause of the pain by decreasing any inflammation. Years ago, the doctors in the ER used to give it IV to patients complaining of kidney stone pain. It was not approved for using it IV or for that kind of pain, so the doctors did not ask the nurses to give it. It worked great though for most people. But that is for acute pain, not for chronic use. You are right, we keep on looking for the right combo of things that help us deal with our pain. Take care, Annette""Congrats on quitting smoking!!! That is a tough one. Thanks for the suggestion. Take care, Annette""Hi, Beth I think Voltarin gel is an NSAID, and I know that Lidoderm patches contain lidocaine (I use them on occasion). Hope this helps. Take care, Annette""The only thing I have to add to what Charles already said is that one should remember that the federal government can still prosecute folks who grow or sell or even possess marijuana. Even in the states with recreational or medical marijuana laws. They don<APO>t do it very often, but they recently got some people out here on the West Coast. Take care, Annette""Kittydollface, I have to agree with Peskypain<APO>s comment about the nurse or assistant asking when I took my last pill every time she gets a urine test. If you were asked, you did sign a contract. If not, find the blank place on the urine test form to show the doctor. Take care, Annette""I used Tramadol for many years as an adjunct to my opiates, it made my MS Contin (generic) last much longer when I first got up out of bed. It finally after many years stopped working, so I stopped taking it. I took 100 mgs. one time a day. 200 mgs. BID keeps you within the right amount for total daily dosing, but 200 mg. is a bit high for each dose according to the instructions I got, 100 mg. was the top amount for each dose back when I took it. It has been awhile since then. Let me know how you do... Hugs, Annette""It took me years also to gain acceptance of the chronic pain that I have. Tramadol IS different than the opiates in many respects. I took 100 mg. a day along with my first MS Contin of the day for many years, it seemed to enhance the effects of the morphine, I did not take as much BT meds during the day as I did when I wasn<APO>t taking it. I know this was true, because I paid attention and tried myself with and without it over the years. When it finally stopped working for me, I stopped taking it. I don<APO>t know why or how it did what it did, but I am so glad it worked for me for all those years. Placebo or not, it made me happy. How are you doing with the rest of life? Well, I hope. Hugs, Annette""Please check with the state of Texas to be sure that it is a state law, some doctors say that to patients rather than deal with them or talk to them directly about their problems. Who is ""they"" who decided that no one should have narcotics? You have to be actually ""dying of cancer of something to be able to even get Lortabs.""? Ask about who has passed these laws and on what level, then check up on it yourself. If it IS a state law, there are NO doctors in Harris or Polk counties who are prescribing them legally. I would move away from Texas, but if you have done without them for over a year, try other options first. Take care, Annette""Wilma, Congratulations!!!! Take care, Annette""If you can<APO>t use fentanyl patches, there are other long acting opiates to take by mouth. Methadone, MS Contin, Oxycontin, Opana, etc. I personally use methadone as a long acting med, very cheap. Take care, Annette""Synthetic THC is available in ALL States as Marinol a drug made to alleviate nausea and weight loss in cancer pts. Keep in mind that the federal government sees fit to keep marijuana illegal per federal law. Take care, Annette""You have probably already tried this, but if you haven<APO>t already, try adjusting the times you take your meds, not just the opiates but all of them. Amitryptaline and Cymbalta both made my spouse very loopy, I noticed the Cymbalta right away and mentioned it to his doctor. He said that he had not heard of it before, but to try giving it to him at night just before he went to sleep anyway. This was many years ago. He also suggested that my honey take his meds singly, rather than together. It sucks that in this day and age, we have not managed to find a good pain controller. Take care, Annette""Toradol is an NSAID, but can only be used for very limited time frames due to adverse effects. Tramadol is listed as a non-narcotic in many drug books, but does cause withdrawal in many people when it has been used daily for a period of time, other people have no trouble going off of it. If 5 mg. of oxycodone makes your daughter feel loopy, then maybe tramadol 50-100 mg. is all she needs for pain right now. Tramadol is recommended for mild to moderate pain. Some folks find it works best if used on a set schedule every 6 hours, some people don<APO>t find it strong enough to help much at all. I<APO>ve used it and I like it. Some problems cannot be fixed, and it sounds like your daughter has some that cannot be fixed. In that case one must find out all her options and decide what to do next. I personally believe that it is best to exhaust all the non-surgical options before going to a surgically implanted device for pain control. She should be aware that the loopy feeling you describe is often from too high a dose of opiates and/or goes away within a few weeks on the drugs on a regular basis. There are other drugs in addition to the short acting one she has tried. Long acting opiates often do not give one a loopy feeling as the medicine is released very slowly into ones system. I suggest she try whatever one the doctor suggested at night and see how she does. One copes so much better if one can sleep at night. She may want to try taking a long acting med both at night and in the daytime to avoid the loopy feeling the short acting meds can give us. There are non-opiate meds like antidepressants or antiseizure meds that are often used for chronic pain that she might try. They mediate the neurotransmitters that carry the pain signals to our brains. ALL drugs have some side effects for some people, but most go away with a bit of time, and if one med doesn<APO>t work there are others she might try. I have been on narcotics for well over ten years on a daily basis, and have never felt doped up. They do make me able to function pretty well. Best of luck to you both. She is lucky to have you researching things for her. Take care, Annette""Meds vary for all of us, what works for you might not work well for me. You like Opana, Charles likes fantanyl???? I am doing fine on cheap, old methadone. I tend to see internists, and family practice doctors for pain management (and everything else), you like rheumies. I am an old nurse and have found that doctors vary immensely. I feel whatever individual doctor you find that works for you is the best. I am glad you have found a path that works well for you at this point in your life. Take care, Annette""Or, you might discover that any opiate will cause constipation. That has been my experience. I hope it all works out for you, and your GI problems dissipate. Exercise helps me manage both pain and constipation. Not to the point of reducing pain meds though. Take care, Annette""I am so sorry for the loss of your arm. Especially after such a long battle to heal. Please look up the difference between addiction and dependence. If after one year or ten years, you are only taking 30 mg. of oxycodone, I doubt you are addicted, but rather are dependent on the meds for pain management and will go through withdrawal if they are stopped suddenly. I hope you are seeing a psychiatrist/therapist. I used cognitive behavoural therapy when I became very depressed at one point in my life. I continue to use it because it works, my depression went away completely. Please do not blame everything on the pills, it sounds like you have had a very difficult experience. Take care, Annette""ljude38, Toradol is an NSAID that should not be used chronically. It has a black box warning to that effect. Everyone who takes opioids on a daily basis for more than a few weeks will become dependent on them. We all know that. I had to sign a consent form to that effect before I started using daily opioids about 15 years ago. That is radically different from addiction. Addiction is a search for the high that opioids can give, it has nothing to do with pain management. The percentage of folks that become addicted to their pain meds is actually very low, less than 1% according to an article in ""Nursing 2011"". Stop and think about how many pain meds are prescribed by doctors and advanced practice nurses. You say you are an ""addiction specialist"" in your post, what is your educational and certification process? Take care, Annette""Sorry, I do not think chiropractic is a good option for neck problems. My husband<APO>s chiropractor told me to never, ever, let any chiropractor touch my neck again after my MRI showed the cervical spine of a 90 year old woman in my 38 year old neck. I have DDD of the spine, migraines, etc. He felt and I agree that the risk of a stroke is too common when the neck is adjusted by chiropractic methods. A nurse friend of mine had a stroke while on her chiropractor<APO>s table, she was taken by ambulance to a hospital where she was diagnosed and treated. It took her about three years to recover fully. I have since read that the vertebral artery can be torn and the tear can travel up the artery into the brain during an adjustment, causing a stroke. Everyone has a different opinion about chiropractors, do your own research. Take care, Annette""You need to alter your attitude if you want to find a good woman to love you. When I was ten years older than you, I married a man who was terminal with cancer (before I had FMS). That was nearly 20 years ago and he didn<APO>t die, he got well. He thought he was going to die, but figured he should get a job so he could contribute financially to our household. He decided to quit treatment because it made him too weak to work, and then he got well. Go figure, we got a miracle. Then, later, I developed FMS, and now he is the main breadwinner, and I collect SSDI, and take care of our home. My son is all grown up, he was ten when we married. No good woman is going to fall in love with someone who ""feels miserable everyday"". I would suggest some cognitive behavioral therapy to help you get your head straight about living with a chronic illness, and some good pain management to improve your pain levels as a start. I don<APO>t know if opioids are the right way to go at your age or not, but certainly if you have tried all the other FMS treatments, they are worth trying. Most research shows that opioids are only worthwhile in certain subsets of FMS, they often do not work for FMS pain. They sure help me get from one day to the next. I have plenty of happiness and joy in my life. You have to decide to be happy, I have. Get out and do some volunteer work, do good for your community and meet people with like minds. When the time is right for you, you will find someone to marry and have a family with. It usually happens as soon as you stop looking for it. A great book for me was ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"" by Dr. Margaret A. Caudill, MD, PhD. It is fabulous. Take care, Annette""I read an article about this today. They are suggesting that 650 mg. be the maximum dose taken without a RX. They have also suggested not selling any opiates mixed with acetaminophen, things like vicodin and percocet. Apparently, these meds are connected with a lot of deaths due to acetaminophen overdoses. As you say the FDA does not have to follow this committee<APO>s recommendations, but it usually does. A pain management class I attended recently suggested that 2000 mg. would soon be the maximum dose recommended per day for long term pain management. Sounds like they may have seen this coming. Take care, Annette""The ER will do any blood work that you need done to diagnose the pain you are having now. If it happened to be time for you to have totally unrelated blood work for some other chronic condition, that would be up to the doctor treating you. They may or may not do unrelated blood work. For instance if you had a cold, they would be unlikely to do any blood work at all Take care, Annette""In addition to all the suggestions for home care, please try and establish yourself with a primary care doctor. I know it is tough without insurance, but there are some free/low cost clinics in many areas. Call Goodwill, Salvation Army, Catholic Charities, etc. Your local county health office may also know what is available in your area. You can also Google ""free clinics, name of your home town"". Be honest with all the doctors/nurses you see, tell them about your lack of insurance and ask for help. To get well and stay well, you need an ongoing relationship with a doctor or clinic. Take care, Annette""You need to see your doctor to figure out what is causing your pain. Is the pain similar to what you had before, when the liver cysts were diagnosed? The good news is that your liver is on your right side, not your left. Are you sure you have your right and left sides correct? Take care, Annette"I am so glad you have begun a path to get yourself right with both your medical conditions. It is complicated to treat chronic pain in someone with addictive tendencies. What kind of addiction treatment are you getting in addition to the suboxone? Take care of yourself. Annette"All opiates cause constipation, and it usually does not go away with time like most side effects do. Your doctor can suggest a bowel care program to prevent constipation. Usually adjusting your diet and drinking plenty of water comes first. Stool softeners help some people, but many people on opiates require stimulant type laxatives because the opiates slow down the action of the intestines. Rotating to a different opiate may be necessary for your pain since the Percocet is wearing off quicker than it did before. Talk to your doctor. Take care, Annette""I am sorry for your situation. However, sometimes surgery is absolutely the only thing left to do for AVN of the hip. My husband had AVN in one hip and walked with a cane and was on methadone for nearly two years while he finally got rid of a chronic non-healing wound that had multiple staph infections. He managed to keep working as a big truck mechanic throughout this period, but I don<APO>t know how he managed that. His pcp said from the xrays he shouldn<APO>t be able to walk at all. He finally had vascular surgery for the wound and it healed. He had his new hip put in last August. He was off the methadone within a few weeks of surgery, and back to his usual work without restrictions in 8 weeks. He had spinal anesthesia which is usual for hip replacement surgery, that would be a plus for you with lung problems. If I were you I would start saving up sick days and cash for the surgery. People who do not have friends or family to help them at home usually go to a rehab center for a few more days until they can manage for themselves. My husband was totally able to fend for himself within one week after his surgery. Take care, Annette""Swank is right. We met with four different orthopedic surgeons before choosing one. Make sure you see someone who does 4-6 hip replacements a week, practice makes perfect. Take care, Annette""You need to talk to your doctor about this. Tramadol can lower your seizure threshold, especially if you are taking certain other drugs. The overdose of this drug can be very dangerous and can lead to death. This is a drug that usually needs to be tapered down slowly, but again, please talk to your doctor. Take care, Annette""The ER should have given you discharge instructions including who to follow up with and when. Gastritis and an ulcer will take time to heal, you don<APO>t just get well immediately. Are you following all the instructions they gave you, and taking any meds properly? Many ulcers are caused by a bacteria and antibiotics will help clear them up. Take care, Annette""If you are not improving in the time frame they suggested, call the doctor they gave you the referral for and make an appt. As expensive as the ER is, it is usually cheaper to see the doctor they refer you to. You can always go back to the ER if you feel it is necessary. Take care, Annette""It is tough being the caregiver of someone you love who is in pain all the time. I would suggest your husband see a pain management doctor. The surgeons who do the operations are not trained to manage long term pain. He can certainly look into SSDI, financially it is tough, no income and no medical insurance unless you can work instead of him. Call your local hospital and ask if they have any support groups for family members of folks with chronic illnesses. Lots of places do have groups for caregivers to get together once in awhile and talk and share ideas. Some places even have respite care. Take care, Annette""My friend went to a drug abuse program and they also used the two terms interchangeably, in the medical world we do not. I am a RN and have always been taught the difference between addiction and dependence. I went to school 39 years ago, the terms were different back then, but a distinction was made between the two. I do not know why you all use the two words interchangeably, perhaps because some drug abuse clinics do not allow the use of any opiates that cause dependence, even for chronic pain. Perhaps you could discuss this with your colleagues and let us know what you come up with. Many of us are sensitive about it, but mostly because we want the public to know that most people who use daily opiate therapy for pain are NOT addicts requiring drug abuse treatment. Many of us lead happy, functional lives. I was certainly not offended, just want to share the accurate medical terms. Please let me know what you and your colleagues think about the whole thing from your point of view. Take care, Annette""Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor used for congestive heart failure and/or high blood pressure. I don<APO>t understand why he is taking it on an as needed basis for pain???? I don<APO>t even know of any off label uses in pain management. Can you point me to any links that would explain this? If you are an addiction therapist, then you are aware of the difference between dependence and addiction. Addiction is rare in people who take opiates as directed for pain, less than 5% according the most recent studies quoted in my nursing journal. It happens when people start taking the opiates to get high, rather than for the pain they are prescribed for. If the Vax-D gave him relief for a year, I would give it another shot if his doctor feels it advisable. Take care, Annette""The reasons for the pain he is currently having don<APO>t seem all that important at this point in time. If it is his own fault due to something he did postop, and I am not saying it is, what would you do with that information, guilt him to death about it? Unless he is scheduling another surgery and you are worried he will overdo things, it just isn<APO>t important. He should go see his doctor, discuss honestly what his pain levels are currently, and ask what treatment options he has left. Then decide what to try next. As Charles said, having withdrawal symptoms when one slows or stops taking a drug, is a sign of dependence on that drug, not addiction. All addiction nowadays is considered drug abuse. There is no such thing as ""medically appropriate addiction"". The definitions have changed somewhat in the 39 years I have been nursing. The current definitions are what Charles and I keep saying they are. They have not changed in the last 10+ years. Take care, Annette""I would run like a rabbit from those doctors, lol. I have found there are two types of pain management clinics. One is like yours, they tend to push high cost procedures and injections and avoid taking time with a patient to find the best meds one can use or any low tech treatment. I personally think it is because they get more money from insurance companies that way, but i may be biased. The other type of pain management clinic is one that uses procedures and injections more conservatively, and also uses PT, OT, biofeedback, TENS, massage, psychotherapy, oral meds, etc. This would be the type of place I would search out if my current doctor was no longer available. I only take info from reliable medical sites to my doctor, places like Medscape. I would also ask for evidence based medical studies to prove that a procedure the doctor suggests to me actually works. If they can<APO>t give me studies to show it is effective, I would pass also. I totally agree with you on all the points you made, great minds think alike, lol. Take care, Annette""The type of diagnostic imaging would depend on what was injured and how the injury occurred. Worker<APO>s Comp is very narrowly focused, they only treat and diagnose for the specific injury that happened at work in 2005. None of us are really qualified to determine just what kind of diagnostic imaging would be needed based on the little information you have given us. I would see what the CT scan shows and go from there. Almost all adults develop bulging discs over time, that is just part of walking upright. They do not necessarily cause symptoms. Take care, Annette""I am sure Charles will reply also, but I just wanted to make a few comments. First, you need to be aware of the difference between addiction and dependence. Addiction is the craving for the drug to get high, not to relieve your physical pain. It also entails using it in spite of negative consequences on your life, like loss of job or relationships due to the drugs, or arrests, etc. Dependence merely means your body gets used to having it in your system and if you were to stop it suddenly without tapering off of it, you would go through some sort of physical withdrawal symptoms. Many classes of drugs cause dependence, not just pain meds. Some antidepressants, some high blood pressure meds, etc. need to be tapered off slowly when you stop using them. Simply needing a drug to get through your life is not a sign of addiction. Diabetics need insulin or other meds to control their blood sugar. Hypertensive people need meds to keep their blood pressure normal, people with pain may need meds to control that pain to make them productive members of society. It might interest you to know that when someone is newly diagnosed with diabetes, it is often difficult to convince them that they need to continue their meds for life, same with people with hypertension. People connect the need for taking meds everyday of the rest of their life with some kind of weakness or change that they really hate. It takes time for anyone to adjust to that fact. No one wants to be sick, or wants to admit to themselves that they need medical help to stay well. This is a normal adjustment to any kind of chronic illness. It is also a normal reaction for your loved ones to have as they get used to your chronic illness, and try to support you in however you choose to deal with it. Many years ago, while I was in nursing school in 1968-70, I was taught about a medical study that tracked how much pain meds folks used over the course of the study. Some had additional education by nurses about how the meds worked and were told that they should take them as soon as they felt pain, not wait until the pain was severe. Others simply got the usual instructions on the bottle that said take one to two pills every 4-6 hours, as needed for pain. The study showed that folks who treated their pain early on actually ended up taking less pills than the other folks, and reported less pain over the course of the study. As a nurse, I knew this was true from professional experience, but as a patient it took me awhile to learn to do it correctly myself. Like you, I simply did not want to take that kind of med. When I finally stopped working, a nurse friend of mine told me that now I would have no excuse not to take my meds as I should, instead of putting it off until my pain was severe. She was absolutely right. ALL the medical studies I have read about people who take opiates as prescribed for pain state that there is a 5% or less rate of addiction. These studies included addicts in recovery who needed to use opiates for pain. This is a very low rate of addiction as a side effect of opiate use. I feel it is an acceptable risk for me. That said, I am aware of every pill I put in my mouth. I ask myself if I am having physical pain before I take a pain pill, if the answer is no, I don<APO>t take it. I am very careful not to take pain pills for any other reason. I used to work in addiction treatment, and it is a very scary thing, not many addicts get and stay well. I have been on this site for well over ten years, and I can easily say that over that time, well less than 5% of the folks who post here who use opiates seemed to develop addiction problems. I probably tend to over-rate the folks who show addiction symptoms to be safe. Trust me if you are this worried about addiction, you probably have little risk of becoming addicted. The typical addict tends to take a lot of opiates and have many excuses for needing to do so. Take care, Annette""I forgot to mention tolerance, the last of the concerns you mentioned. Tolerance is the need to take higher doses of the medicine to get the same response as far as relief goes. This is a natural, and expected side effect of opiates. Recently, there has been some question in the research I have read that perhaps most people just have worsening symptoms that require more medicine as time goes on. The good thing about opiates is that usually as long as the dose is raised slowly over time, one does not have increasing side effects other than constipation. So you really don<APO>t have a set ceiling for the dose, it can be raised and raised without any terrible side effects. Constipation can usually be controlled with a good bowel care program. If you develop other side effects it is important to let your doctor know. Like all meds, opiates do not work for all people for all kinds of pain. Sometimes, you just have to look at other treatment methods. Take care, Annette""I am so glad you and your doctor found a combination of meds that work for you. I figured you were in Canada? Codeine Contin isn<APO>t available in the US that I am aware of. My husband is 65, and a diesel mechanic, he sure wouldn<APO>t let a younger guy outwork him, so I get what you mean. I have told him since he had a hip replaced last year to slow it down some, but I don<APO>t think he has. He really likes fixing trucks that are broke, he won<APO>t consider less physical work yet. He is hoping to die or last until he is old enough get to his full retirement from SS in a year or so. If he took it now, they would deduct a percentage from his monthly check for taking it early. He would get even more if he waited until he was 70, I will bet that he tries his best to put it off until then, lol. Take care, Annette""I am always happy to be of help. I have had migraines for many years. I would suggest you start keeping a headache diary. I used one of those small Hallmark datebooks, I would mark every day I had a headaches, and jot down any meds I took. A food diary might also be useful until you know what your triggers are. By figuring out your triggers and eliminating them, you may be able to reduce the frequency and severity of your migraines. There are many kinds of meds available for migraine control now, both for daily preventative use and for rescue when you get a migraine. There is no need to suffer through it on your own. Getting them under control will entail a lot of work on your part, but a doctor can help you get on the right path with medicines. Take care, Annette""Charles, they use a needle to introduce the catheter into the intrathecal space for the trial. I would assume that is what she is talking about. Take care, Annette""I would do far more research prior to having a trial, I would insist that all my questions be answered, including the what if this doesn<APO>t work question, before I arranged to have the trial done. I would ask the surgeon what his complication rate is and what his infection rate is. I would ask him how many of these procedures he has already done, and how many he does per week to maintain his skills. I would not settle for less than 100 total IT pump insertion procedures or less than 4-5 per week. I would ask a comprehensive pain management doctor what ALL my treatment options are so that I could decide if I was ready to give up on less invasive treatment options. You say you aren<APO>t happy with your oral meds as they aren<APO>t working as well as they used to, what about just increasing the doses, or adjusting the schedule? Rotating opiates? I would ask the doctor who is putting this in what he considers success, does he mean the person would be pain free? Does he expect a lessening of the oral meds, and by how much? If he does not expect you to be pain free, what pain levels would he expect? If you expect to be pain free once it is done, and he never expected you to get more than 50% improvement in your pain, it is better to know now rather than later. Frankly, I have never even heard of anyone being pain free when they used an IT pump, usually they can decrease their oral meds but they still take them. I would call your doctor<APO>s office and ask for an appt. to discuss this with HIM in person prior to your appt. for the trial or you will have to reschedule it. Don<APO>t get all your info from the maker<APO>s of the pump, they are trying to sell them. Take care, Annette""Worker<APO>s Comp. is different in every state and many times a state will have more than one type of coverage, so my experience out here in Oregon would be totally different than yours. As an old nurse, I would ask W/C if you have a case manager who oversees your care. Many systems use case managers, they are often a RN, but sometimes they are non-medical people. Make friends with this person. You did mention a case manager being happy with your outcome after your SI injection, so I think you have one. My husband had a work injury and he ended up going through several case managers, none nurses. I documented every phone call, with date, time and person<APO>s name in a binder. I followed up phone calls with a written letter or fax and kept records of all that also. This way there can be no miss-communications about what you considered an unsuccessful injection. You had a severe injury, I would expect at least one year to heal from the fractures alone, never mind a spinal injury. Going up and down hills or stairs is difficult and I am not surprised you still need a cane or a crutch. I would not change to ultram long acting 300 mg. and expect it to work the same as 2 vicodin every four hours. Everyone reacts differently to meds, but I think that was just wishful thinking on the part of the doctor. I would suggest you ask for a referral to a pain management specialist, not a doctor who is an interventionist only, but someone who uses all kinds of pain management including oral meds, PT, OT, biofeedback, massage, acupuncture, psychotherapy, etc. in addition to procedures and injections. Orthopedic doctors are not trained in chronic pain management, and really are not very good at it. Good pain management is essential to getting well again. Take care of yourself. Annette""I am unfamiliar with a case manager going to your doctor appts. with you. They don<APO>t do that out here. Is she an RN? If she doesn<APO>t have medical training, I think she should probably just keep her mouth shut and let the doctor do what he thinks best, lol. Hang onto the lawyer, once my husband had a lawyer involved in his case things went along better, but had I not insisted on a change from what we were doing, I think he never would have gotten well. It seems here once you have a lawyer, he just intervenes whenever there is a problem and they hash it out instead of us arguing with the W/C people. It was less hassle for us anyway. Ask your lawyer what the ramifications of refusing more injections would be? Are you allowed to refuse a specific treatment without being declared non-compliant? I just can<APO>t imagine anyone going back to work as a police officer in 2-3 months after breaking both legs, and injuring your back. You are a police officer, that is a very active job and requires one to be fit and healthy. Otherwise, both you , your partner, and the public are all potentially in danger. It would be very difficult to adjust to waiting a long time to go back to work after being told you would be fine in a couple of months. Be very firm with the pain management doctor about how little relief you got after the injections. I<APO>ve never had any, but I am not sure I would, I have not seen a lot of evidence based research showing they work. Get the doctor to give you proper oral pain meds to take for now, if you get reasonable relief from pain, you will be able to recover more quickly. You need to sleep properly, eat well, and follow whatever exercise program they give you. To do that you need pain relief. Take care, Annette""Just go in and see him like he asked you to do. Explain to him as you did here, and see what he says. There is no way for any of us here to guess what he will do or say. I am not aware of any drugs that can cause a false positive marijuana report. Ask him if you can have a hair sample taken for analysis, this is the place where if you do smoke dope it will show up for the longest amount of time. If the hair sample is negative, then he will know the other test was incorrect. Take care, Annette""I had one disc removed from my neck at C5-6 years ago. I had no hardware or bone grafts done. Six months later the disc above that point herniated when the car I was in was rear-ended. I waited until I was losing function in my hands before I had the surgery. I would not opt to have it just for pain, as the success rate is not high enough to offset the risks of the surgery. So, I never had a second surgery, and things healed on there own. I have numbness in my hands if my neck is in a certain position, but the pain is far less than before. I would see a neurologist, not a neurosurgeon, and ask him what all your treatment options are, then you have to decide. If you go to a surgeon, they cut, so that is what they offer you. See a doctor who does not cut, and ask him what you can do. My husband took methadone for chronic pain for nearly two years, it worked well for him, he was able to continue working as a big truck mechanic. After he finally had his hip replaced he tapered off of the methadone easily, with no withdrawal symptoms. Take care, Annette""You need to go to the doctor and at the least have an xray of your thigh/hip. No one can diagnose you on line. Take care, Annette""Insurance companies are trying to cut back on their costs, if your generic Actiq costs between $6-12,000 it makes sense that this would be a huge cutback for them. Are you on VA, employer provided insurance, private insurance that you must pay the entire premium for, or some kind of Medicare/Medicaid insurance? If you use up to 8 suckers a day, what about increasing/using fentanyl patches to cover most of your regular use? They contain the same medicine. Most of the research I have read suggests that one shouldn<APO>t really be using more than a couple of breakthrough med doses per day, because ones long lasting, scheduled meds should be at a dose high enough to hold one most of the day. From what I understand, fewer and fewer insurance companies are covering fentanyl suckers for chronic pain, and are writing into their policies that it is only for cancer pain. Ask if there is an appeals process or not. Sometimes there is, sometimes not. Switching insurance companies can be problematic because private insurance companies generally turn down people with pre-existing conditions. If you have Part D Medicare, I believe you can only change during certain times of the year, and there are numbers you can call to see if there are Part D policies that cover your particular meds. The problem being, of course, that they are allowed to change their list of covered meds any time they want, and you are only allowed to change companies once a year. Not fair, but that is how Congress made it. Take care, Annette""Ditto what Swank said. Also have you been tested for diabetes? And can you learn to play music sitting down (most people can although it may be difficult at first.)? Take care, Annette""I agree that seeing a podiatrist might be a good idea. I totally understand the awkwardness of learning to play bass sitting on a stool, but with a proper mic stand it should still be possible to play and sing. If you suddenly became a paraplegic (that loved music) you would figure it out. You know how much pain you have, only you can know if sitting to play would help. At least you have the distraction of playing and singing, that alone must help with the pain. Take care, Annette""It can take a year or so to find the right medicines to take for migraines or other kinds of headaches. Many of them take 3-4 weeks to see if they will even work or if side effects will go away like they usually do. Taking pain killers, even over the counter things like tylenol or ibuprofen more than three days per week can cause rebound headaches. Then you end up with chronic daily headaches that just don<APO>t seem to respond to anything. Seeing a neurologist who specializes in headaches is the best thing to do. Then stick with him until the two of you find the right treatment combo for you. Take care, Annette""I used cognitive behavioural therapy to get past the idea of having pain for the rest of my life. First thing to remember is that you may not have pain for the rest of your life. Medical research has done amazing things in just the time I have been a nurse, 39 years. They have cured things we thought were incurable and are treating other things successfully for which we thought we had no effective treatment. Look at HIV/AIDS just to name one, it has gone from a death sentence to a chronic illness in the US since the late 1970s. So, they may come up with a cure for my painful conditions. Or, they may come up with better medicines for my pain. Even if they don<APO>t do either, I am far better off than many other people who have far worse illnesses, or pain than I do. Get some real therapy with a good therapist who deals with chronic pain/illness patients. Antidepressants only made me worse, so I learned early on that I had to manage my feelings another way. I did, I haven<APO>t been depressed for well over 10 years now. Find something to do for your community that makes you feel productive. I have been doing volunteer work for many years, it is one of the best things ever. Take care, Annette""It is entirely possible that you were not in withdrawal at all, but coming down with something else. Call your doctor<APO>s office and make an appt. to go in and be seen. Only the doctor can tell you if you were in withdrawal or have some other illness. Write down the time your symptoms started and what they were. Write down the times you put on the original patch, the window of time when it may have fallen off, the time you applied the new patch, and what your symptoms are now. This information will make it easier for the doctor to figure out just what is going on and what to do about it. Take care, Annette""Why are you angry at yourself for your choice of surgeon? Did you have the surgery to relieve pain or to improve function? Charles can give you the numbers on success of lower back surgery, they are poor for pain relief, and somewhat better for improvement of function. Unfortunately, there are no real answers as to why the surgery works on one person and does not work for another person. Choosing the right patient is very difficult, there do not seem to be any set criteria for which person will respond better to surgery. Get a second opinion, and a third if necessary, but do not rush into more surgery, even for a spinal cord stimulator. It is not emergency surgery, take your time making your decision about what to do next. Take care, Annette""He needs to go to the doctor. Perhaps an ER when he has an active headache going. Otherwise, check your community for free/low cost clinics. Call Goodwill, Salvation Army, Catholic Charities, etc. they should know what is available in your area. Take care, Annette""As I said, we all need to research our own conditions and then if that little voice you mention speaks we should listen to it. I personally do not think injections help much, no one has ever suggested spinal injections to me and if they did, I would decline for all of the reasons you mentioned. All I was disagreeing with was comparing doctors to waiters, since that was in the article you quoted, I wasn<APO>t even disagreeing with you, just the author of the article. If he wants to hook me as a reader, he will have to come up with something better than that. I would stop reading there and go on to another article. I suspect that you and I agree more than we disagree. Take care, Annette""When they say ""What do you want us to do?"" Tell them exactly how many breakthrough opiate pills you think you need per month to get by. Show them a journal that shows when your pain increases and decreases again after your cycle. Tell them that you feel the injections are too risky to do that often. They can call hydrocodone/APAP in by phone if necessary. Be open to trying other interventions short of injections also. I take baclofen when my pain flares, and then go off of it, when my flare goes away. That works for me, may not work for you. If they say they won<APO>t give you more meds, then you have to decide if you wish to see another doctor. Take care, Annette""Although I feel that we are our own best advocates, I would never compare a doctor to a waiter. Doctors are not just employees that should do as we tell them to do. They are highly educated professionals. There are good doctors and bad doctors and we all need to know enough about our own conditions to tell the good ones from the bad ones. Take care, Annette""I personally don<APO>t think klonopin is a very good muscle relaxant. Valium makes every one feel good, lol. However, from many years of experience, I would not give someone opiates AND a benzo. I just feel it is a bad mix for most people. There are lots of muscle relaxants, Charles named a number of them. I would just tell your doctor the klonopin is not working. Rather than name your favorite, I would just let him make suggestions, and try whatever he suggests. Take care, Annette""Laminae are bony arches on the vertebrae of the spine. A laminectomy removes this bony arch to relieve pressure on the spinal cord. The pressure may be caused by trauma, or by degeneration of the adjoining disk. If several laminae are removed the vertebrae must be stabilized with a fusion of some sort. Scar tissue is generally referred to as fibrosis, as Crazytexan mentioned. Scar tissue can grow and also apply pressure to the spinal nerves or spinal cord, so you have to be very careful about what kind of surgery you plan. Take care, Annette""I would get a second opinion from another gastroenterologist who is not connected with the group the first one is in. Take copies of all your previous workups, and films, etc. See what he says. Not all pancreatitis is caused by alcohol, but it is all made worse by alcohol, so I am glad to hear you do not drink at all anymore. Since this just started in April of this year, it may still go away completely, no way of knowing for sure in my experience. Take care, Annette""I<APO>ve never had botox. So I can<APO>t really give you a personal experience with it. Before botox was being used, and after I had cervical disc surgery, I had severe spasms for 2-3 months in the tops of my shoulders/upper back/neck area. I went to PT and they applied electronic muscle stimulation to the muscles that were having spasms. What this would do is cause the muscles to contract continuously to the point of muscle fatigue, where they simply were unable to contract anymore, and they finally relaxed. I had maybe three or four treatments and the painful spasms went away. My doctors have always told me those muscles were very tight to palpation, but that was the only time they caused me pain. For your condition, I would be willing to give botox a try. Here are the questions I would ask first: What is the research saying about how long would a set of injections be expected to last? Would it be a permanent solution after a number of treatments, or would I have to continue with botox treatments every few months for the rest of my life? What is the cost of each set of injections? How many patients have YOU (the doctor) treated with my condition with botox? What percentage of those patients had ANY adverse effects at all? What adverse effects are possible? What percentage of your patients got total relief from their spasms? What other treatment options are available at this time? Take care, Annette""pain.com is an excellent resource for me. For medical studies you can go to Medscape and do a search using ""chronic pain management"" in the search engine. I really don<APO>t think it helps anyone to tell their friends/family exactly what meds they take. It is fine to share here, but none of us need to hear about addiction once our doctors have informed us about the possible risks. Loved ones mean well, but they read an article on the internet or see a TV program and think that is all the info there is. ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"", by Dr. Margaret A. Caudill, MD, PhD is an excellent book and has helped me along the road to good health.

Take care, Annette""You need to go back to the doctor and explain to him what you said here. Keep going back and tell him how each treatment works or does not work. If you stop seeing the doctor and just manage on your own, he will think the problem resolved itself. If the CT scan came up clean I am not sure what good an MRI would do. You may have some kind of nerve disorder affecting the nerve that goes to that part of your scalp/skin. Let the doctor decide what kind of tests to order, then ask him how that test will help him treat you. If your doctor does not know what to do with you ask for a referral to someone who does, perhaps a neurologist. Take care, Annette""The anti-seizure meds most commonly used in pain management are gabapentin and Lyrica. Others are also used off label for pain management. These meds are taken on a set schedule, not on an ""as needed"" basis. I find gabapentin very helpful as part of my pain management program. Take care, Annette""You should let a doctor know about these nosebleeds. For two headaches a month, daily meds are usually not given. I take a really cheap med for my migraines, and it works well, but I do have to go to the doctor to get a RX. Take care, Annette""Taking any kind of pain medicine, including tylenol and ibuprofen, can cause rebound headaches, leading to chronic daily headaches. You should not take any more of the medicine than it says to take on the bottle unless your doctor specifically okays it. They can cause liver failure, bleeding in the stomach, etc. To prevent rebound headaches, you should not take these kinds of medicines more than three days per week. I would recommend going to a headache specialist, usually a neurologist who specializes in headaches. There are meds specifically designed for headaches out there that work fairly well. Take care, Annette""The only other med I can suggest that you are not already taking is the Lidoderm patch. You can cut them up and apply them wherever it hurts, and the skin is intact. You are taking a lot of meds right now, is it possible that you are having side effects from one of the pills? If this doctor is not responding to your needs, I would change doctors. Find a neurologist that is willing to spend time answering your questions. It has only been 5 weeks, it is highly possible that you will get completely well. Take care, Annette""I have had a couple of spinal taps, no after effects for me. My husband has had many of them back when he had cancer, and then again to check for a recurrence of the cancer. He has had no problems since. We are both much older than you are, I am 58, and he is 65. As a nurse, I have taken care of a lot of patients over the years, and really do not remember anyone complaining of chronic back pain as an after effect of a spinal tap. You may get a bruised feeling for 2-3 weeks, but nothing more than that. It seems like if the spinal tap caused your back pain, it would have started immediately, not a week or so later. It sounds more like your chronic back pain is flaring up, or you are one of those people who have every side effect they hear about. I have a friend like that, she is no longer allowed to read the medicine inserts, because if she does, she will have every side effect she reads about. If she doesn<APO>t read them, she rarely has any side effects. She has a Master<APO>s degree, so she is no dummy, just very suggestible. When I was in nursing school one of my classmates complained of every symptom we studied, it is very common. See your doctor, get checked out, then you will know if you need to be concerned or not. Take care, Annette""Ignore the lawyer commercials on TV. Go to his doctor and discuss the pros and cons of any treatment, then decide for yourselves what to do. I have taken Triptan type drugs for migraines for many years. A commercial came on TV about a lawyer having a ""study"" proving they were dangerous drugs, and he was looking for a group of patients to sign up with him to do a class action suit. These kinds of lawsuits make lots of money for the lawyers, and little for the patients. Some drug companies will settle them out of court just to get rid of them. Anyhow, I checked all over and even asked my pharmacist to check to see if the FDA had put out a ""warning"" on this type of drugs, like this guy said they did. I found nothing at all, and when I called the number on TV I got a paralegal who also could not tell me where to find any information about this so-called study. It was all bogus. I get all kinds of emails in my spam box about different lawyers trying to put together class action lawsuits about various drugs. I read where there was a recall of a certain lot number of patches in one generic company due to malfunction in the delivery of the drug with the match. This can happen to any kind of medicine. I think the patch is as safe as pills when used properly and one should watch for signs of any problems like the instructions tell you to. I personally don<APO>t think it matters much which form of opiate one uses, I believe the dose and frequency is the important thing. If the patch seems like a good choice for your husband, give it a try. Take care, Annette""I learned to use cognitive behavioral therapy techniques to help manage my pain in addition to medicines. This has really helped me. I have learned to not think in catastrophic terms. My pain gets worse like yours does, but I know from experience that I can stand it, I don<APO>t pass out, I move through it and get on with the rest of my life. I would share your pain levels and nausea with your doctor and ask for a referral to a cognitive behavioral therapist to teach you how best to learn to cope better. Take care, Annette""I also have DDD in my neck with herniated discs, etc. and my husband<APO>s chiropractor told me years ago to never let a chiro put his hands on my neck, that it would be very dangerous. I have since read that chiropractic adjustments on the cervical spine can cause strokes because they can tear one of the vertebral arteries and the artery will tear right up into the base of the brain. One nurse friend of mine that I worked with years ago had this happen to her, she stroked in the chiropractor<APO>s office and was paralyzed on one side, they put her in an ambulance and took her to the hospital. It took a couple of years for her to recover full motor skills. Take care, Annette""If you routinely need more than 4 doses of your percocet per day, it is probably time to move up to a long acting opiate on a set schedule, with your percocet taken as needed for your breakthrough pain. I NEVER recommend a person take more pain meds than are prescribed as they may eventually run out of meds early and have to do without. Discuss in a face to face meeting with your doctor just what your pain levels are and how you need to take your meds to manage your pain. I would not suggest you ask for any meds by name, just tell him how you are doing and ask him what to try next. When I was in your position, I started out using a long acting pain med just at night so I could sleep for 6-8 hours. Later I moved it up to twice a day. I also recommend using other meds and techniques to control your pain in addition to the opiates. Few of us are so old that we do not have to be aware that the day will come that our doctors will no longer increase our opiate levels. We must be careful to only increase them when nothing else works. I personally do not increase my opiates when I have a painful flare, I add baclofen for a week or so, then taper off of it. This enables me to keep my opiates at a more stable dose for a longer time. Take care, Annette""First, I would not use Wikipedia for medical research. It is not accurate enough for me. I<APO>ve been a nurse for 39 years and have never heard of anyone getting sick enough from normal doses of hydrocodone that they required hospitalization. Usually, one might get nauseated and stop taking the medicine and ask their doctor for something else. Occasionally, someone might vomit from the medicine, but a normal person would then stop using it and the nausea would go away as the medicine wore off in 4-6 hours. Second, in your case, it is also possible that your vomiting was caused by irritation of your stomach caused by blood in your stomach from the procedure you had done. Wisdom tooth extraction commonly causes bleeding, after which the blood is swallowed and blood in the stomach commonly causes vomiting. Vomiting is common after wisdom tooth extraction if blood is swallowed, as it is after a severe nosebleed where blood is swallowed. At any rate, I hope by now you have called your oral surgeon and let him know how you are doing, so he could advise you what to do next. Take care, Annette""I agree with Charles about the whys of your surgery helping you decide whether or not to go ahead. I would research the spinal surgeons in your area and see two more of the most highly qualified ones for their opinions. Let them all know that you are getting more than one opinion, and you will decide what to do after you gather all your information. Meanwhile, I would also go see a good neurologist and ask him what other treatments are available to you. Take any MRI films with you (the real films or CD not the report). See a pain management doctor that does comprehensive treatment, not just injections and procedures that fatten his wallet. Find out from him what treatment options he would suggest. Ask everyone you talk to what they consider a successful treatment, what pain levels they find acceptable after their treatment is done. You may or may not be in agreement with them. After you gather all that information and digest it, you can make a decision. This IS NOT an emergency surgery unless you are losing bladder and bowel control. Take care, Annette""I am glad to hear you are doing well with your SCS. It is always good to hear about a good outcome. Take care, Annette""What meds are you are taking for pain now? All you mentioned was tramadol. If all you are taking is tramadol, why don<APO>t you take a stronger pain med and avoid the surgery for as long as possible? I have used opiates daily for chronic pain for around ten years now, I have no trouble thinking or doing daily activities due to the meds. The pain is much more limiting than the opiates are. Take care, Annette""In making this decision, be sure to discuss all the details with the surgeon who will install it, and the PM doctor who will manage it. I would ask them all your questions, and more. I would ask the surgeon how many of these procedures he has already done? I consider 100 to be necessary to gain expertise. I would ask him how many he currently does per week to get an idea of how much practice he gets. The more the better. I would ask him what percentage of his patients get infections, or other complications due to the surgery? How often does he need to do a revision because the leads aren<APO>t in the right places? Ask for percentages, not any kind of answer like ""My patients don<APO>t get infections."" A really good surgeon will know what his infection rate is, and will be willing to tell you. If someone has no patients who get infections, he is either lying about it, or not doing many surgeries. I would ask the PM doctor who is pushing for this, what he considers a ""success"" after it is done. Does he expect full pain relief, or 50% pain relief, or even less? How much pain medicine would he expect you to need after the process is complete? How often do his patients need additional surgery to make the SCS work properly? Since you would be doing this in a hospital or outpatient surgery center, be sure to call them and ask them what their infection rate is for your procedure. If they won<APO>t tell you, ask what the nurse/patient ratio is. The fewer patients a nurse has, the less likely you are to get an infection according to some studies. I am a nurse, and I feel this is really important. The less rushed a nurse is the more likely she is to wash her hands between patients, and follow sterile procedures like she/he ought to. Good luck with all your research, that is the best thing a person can do in my opinion. Keep in touch. Take care, Annette""Go see your doctor and get a proper examination done. You can get a slow bleed in your brain from a hit on the head. No one on line can diagnose that. Take care, Annette""I think you need to post an email account that one can respond to. We are not supposed to recommend doctors on the boards. I would open a special account for this purpose on Yahoo or Hotmail, rather than using your personal email account. That way you won<APO>t get spam on your personal account, and you can close this one once you are done using it, or just save it for on line purposes. I am on the west coast so I can<APO>t really help you with names of clinics/doctors in your area anyway. Take care, Annette""If the reason you have to sit down after walking 25-30 feet is to recover from the pain, then you ARE dealing with pain. If you had better pain management perhaps you would be able to stay on your feet longer, I don<APO>t know because I am not you. I have FMS now, in addition to DDD in my cervical spine. I had one cervical spine surgery before I had FMS because I was losing function in my dominant right hand, I had already lost grip strength and some fine motor movement. The disc above the surgical site herniated six months after the surgery, but I am functionally okay other than periodic numbness in my hands if I flex my neck for any length of time. I did not opt to have additional surgery, it has been well over 15 years now. I will deal with any pain I have in a non-invasive way. I would certainly never consider surgery to decrease pain now that I have FMS. I have had spinal stenosis in my neck with pressure from a herniated disc that indents the spinal cord since 1992. My symptoms have not worsened, they have remained the same for those 18 years. My understanding of your situation is that you are considering surgery to decrease your pain, so that you can walk/stand longer than you can now. My understanding of spinal surgery from my own neurosurgeon and research I have done since then is that only about 50% of post op patients have any significant decrease in pain. The studies I have read most recently consider a 50% decrease in pain to be a successful surgery. A 50/50 chance of getting my pain reduced by half is not worth the risks involved in spinal surgery, to me. My neurosurgeon would not even do disc surgery to improve pain levels, he felt that the risks outweighed the benefits. I agree with him. I had a blood clot after surgery, and could have died. I was on blood thinners for six months after surgery to fix that and prevent further clots. I made that decision before I had FMS, which only makes my personal odds even worse, now that I do have FMS. When doctors talk about doing spinal surgery to increase function, they are not talking about what you mentioned. They are talking about functional deficits due to nerve impingement, not due to increased pain. From what I have read about 80% of post op surgical patients have increased function in this kind of case. My personal question to folks when they tell me they can<APO>t walk is this, ""If your house was on fire, and you were going to burn to death, would you be able to walk out on your own?"" If the answer is, ""Yes."" Then you are able to move and you need to be treating the pain. Again, only my personal opinion. If the answer is, ""No."", then you may need to consider if surgery is right for you to improve your ability to function. Also, my personal opinion. I would believe your rheumatologist, I doubt anyone with Lupus and FMS would benefit from spinal disc surgery if it is being done to decrease pain. You mentioned epidural shots that have helped somewhat with pain in the past, but you don<APO>t mention having tried any other pain management techniques or meds. I would repeat the shots, and try other the many other methods for pain management. Oral meds are only one other option, including opiates if appropriate. Surgery should always be the last resort after other efforts fail. Only you and your own doctors who have examined you and your films can decide what is right for you. Take care, Annette""The problem according to all the research I have read is that it is pretty much impossible with today<APO>s testing capabilities to tell just where the pain is coming from. Fibromyalgia is also neurological pain. I have both FMS and DDD, causing spinal stenosis, and I frankly could not tell you with any accuracy which is causing the pain I have in my shoulder/arm off and on. My doctor also says she cannot tell with reliability which is causing the pain at this point in time. I had spinal stenosis prior to developing FMS, and it did not cause any significant pain, so just having it show up on films does not mean it is causing symptoms. The doctor fixed that when he did my spinal surgery in 1992. My doctors have all told me that MRIs do not tell them where pain is coming from when it comes to folks with DDD, never mind people with FMS to confuse the picture even more. The latest article I have read about back surgery said that in a large study they did on folks who had surgery and folks who did more conservative medical treatments, that both groups were the same after two years. I personally do not feel the risk of spinal surgery is worth ending up the same as the folks who did not have that risk in two years. But then, I had complications after my surgery, although it was successful for improving function, which is why I had it done. The second time I herniated a disc, along with developing more spinal stenosis, and more osteophytes, I declined surgery, that was in 1993, so far so good. You are absolutely right in determining what is causing the pain, in order to choose the best treatment. The main thing in having a successful spinal surgery is being able to choose the patients that it will help, and right now it seems to be a crap shoot with folks without other chronic pain syndromes. How would you choose the right patients for spinal surgery when they also have other chronic pain syndromes? There is NO test that I know of to tell you how to pick them. Take care, Annette""I cannot remember the contents of every post that everyone has written, so I would have only responded to what you wrote in the specific post that I responded to. I apologize if I didn<APO>t recall what you had said in a previous post. There are just too many posts to recall everything. I have too much pain and too little energy to go back and search for other posts people have written to get up to date. As far as the MRI goes, if your falls were just falling from your feet to the ground, I am not sure you could injure yourself enough from that to need another MRI in less than a year. If you have fallen farther, like down a flight of stairs or something like that, the doctor would do a physical exam at the time of the fall, and then decide if an MRI was needed, and of which part of your back. I can<APO>t think of any kind of minor fall that would require an MRI of all three parts of your back. Did you see the doctor when you fell? Take care, Annette""I am not sure you understand what they mean when they tell you to elevate your foot, since you state that you are sitting and keeping your foot elevated. By elevation, they mean your foot must always be higher than your heart. Most people cannot do that in a sitting position. If you are laying down, it means you are laying flat and your leg is up on something like a couch pillow, or even up on the back of a low-backed couch, that would keep your foot higher than your chest. If it swells, it WILL hurt more than any pain meds will fix. It takes longer for swelling to go down than it takes for it to go up. Your toes should be rosy pink and warm, if the leg is swollen under the cast, the toes get pale and cool to cold to the touch. I would consider that an emergency that should be checked out by the doctor. Take care, Annette""Please check with your doctor if he didn<APO>t order the excedrin you are taking. Percocet has tylenol in it, as does the excedrine, you might take too much tylenol. Too much tylenol can cause liver damage or death, both too much in one dose, and too much per day. Read the excedrine bottle label to find out how many mg. of acetaminophen (tylenol) is in each pill. I believe that each pill used to contain acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine, but I am not sure nowadays what they have in them. Then multiply that by how many pills you take in a 24 hour period. Look on the percocet bottle, there should be numbers like 5/650 after the name of the medicine. The second number is the acetaminophen amount. Multiply that by how many pills you take in a 24 hour period, that would be your total mg. per 24 hours of acetaminophen. Add the two totals together to figure out how much acetaminophen (tylenol) you take in a 24 hour period. That is the number you need to discuss with your doctor or pharmacist. This is assuming you are not taking acetaminophen in any other form in other medicines. One should never take more than 4,000 mg. per day according to the old rules. The FDA is now suggesting we take less than that per day, but did not give a lower number, we should discuss it with our doctors. One should also not take more than 650 mg. per dose every 4 hours. (if there is 650 mg. in your percocet, then you should not take any more in other forms until 4 hours later) No drinking alcohol while taking tylenol products either. It is all very complicated, speak to your doctor or pharmacist and get specific instructions for you. Take care, Annette""I have a problem with a doctor recommending a treatment that he is selling. How much does he charge per treatment? Medical studies showed that if a doctor has a financial interest in machines, like CT and MRIs, they will order more scans than the doctors who have no financial interest. I would tell him that I would have to think about getting the treatment, and get a second opinion from a doctor who is not selling treatments at his office. Does he have any double blind studies to show that this treatment works on patients who have the same condition as you do? Ask him to see such research and evaluate it yourself. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t think it is worthwhile to compare my pain levels to yours, we all tolerate pain differently and what I would consider tolerable, you may not. I find a 5 most of the time to be tolerable, but if it is always 8-10 I would tell my doctor and work out a change in my treatment plan because that is unacceptable to me. Someone else may find 5 to be intolerable most of the time. The number scale of 0-10 is mainly so the doctor has an idea of whether your pain is getting worse or better or staying the same with various treatments. I would hope when you see him he discusses your pain more fully than just the number. It is normal for it to be lower at rest and higher with certain activities for many people. Too much rest may cause additional pain also. By keeping track of your pain levels, you can time your breakthrough meds for activities that you know will cause you increased pain. I always take mine just before I start certain activities that I know will cause my pain levels to go way up, other activities I may wait and see how I react that day before taking them. I also use my hot tub and other treatment modalities before doing activities that I know will bump up my pain levels. Take care, Annette""I would call the neurologist that you have an appt. with in three months, and ask him if he can put you on the cancellation list. That way if another patient cancels, they will call you and offer you the appt. My hubby was to see a surgeon and also got an appt. several months away, I put him on the cancellation list and he was in within three days. It can<APO>t hurt to try. Take care, Annette""Now, you just have to wait and see what doctor can see you first. Meanwhile I would ask your PCP what you can do in the meantime to alleviate your symptoms. Take care, Annette""I totally agree with Charles about this. I feel if you get a small amount of pain relief from each of several different kinds of treatments, the total will come to a considerable amount of relief. Avoid the places that just want to do expensive injections and procedures. Take care, Annette""If you are certain about the connection between the pain/shortness of breath and the meds, then I would simply not take them anymore. They are not particularly good for migraines anyway. There are many other migraine specific medications, I would try them. Take care, Annette""If you think you may have FMS, ask the doctor for a referral to a rheumatologist. They are the specialists who often end up making the FMS diagnosis. Trust me, FMS IS REAL. Go to www.myalgia.com for good, medical info about FMS. If it sounds like you, print out the article and take it to the doctor to discuss. If you are depressed, that also needs to be treated. Depression and pain feed each other, so you have to treat both if both are present. Try reading ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"" by Dr. Margaret A. Caudill, MD, PhD. I found it very helpful. Also ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns, MD. It has a lot of cognitive behavioral therapy techniques in it that I found very helpful when I went through a depressive episode when I could no longer work due to FMS. Antidepressant medication made me worse, so I used this book alone and have never been depressed since. If you can take antidepressants, you can use both techniques together. Take care, Annette""I understand anyone saying they don<APO>t want to be dependent on meds for the rest of their life. This was common in patients I have had with high blood pressure and diabetes, along with other chronic health issues. It is something we all learn to deal with. You do the life style changes that you can do as far as weight control, exercise, diet, etc. You try all the less invasive treatments, and then you need to learn to accept that you may still need to take some meds for the long term. Find a comprehensive pain management clinic that offers many kinds of treatments including your meds. Try whatever seems like it would help. Take care, Annette""You never know how long nerve damage will last, sometimes it is forever, sometimes not. There is no point in assessing blame for it either, there is no way to tell and the latest studies show that people with and without surgery for disc degeneration end up about the same after two years. That study was in the ""Arthritis Today"" magazine and also said that putting off surgery does not cause permanent nerve damage. Unless of course, you are already incontinent of stool or urine, that is a true emergency requiring surgery to fix right away. If you use other medications along with the opiates, you should be able to keep your doses of opiates lower. Just be aware that you may be on them for a long time and don<APO>t increase the dose quickly. We also never know what the research people will come up with next. I have been on daily opiates for almost twenty years now, it could end up being another twenty years. I don<APO>t think of it that way, I just look at the immediate future and hope the researchers do their magic. I have been a nurse for 39 years now, my great aunt was ""capped"" as a graduate of nursing school in 1915, I have seen them perform miracles in that time. People who used to just die from their diseases, are now being cured completely. Take care, Annette""I believe we should e our own best advocates. Do your research on pain management of breakthrough pain on a legit medical site like Medscape, and print out articles. Take them with you to the doctor who is prescribing the fentanyl patches for you. He should be the one who is responsible for your pain management, including meds. If he isn<APO>t, he needs to send you somewhere else. That is not considered doctor shopping. One doctor should be writing all your prescriptions for pain management. He has two opiate options that I am aware of, one is to increase the fentanyl patch dose so it covers your pain, some articles suggest that. The other is to prescribe a short acting opiate for the breakthrough pain to be taken a couple of times a day as needed along with the fentanyl patch. Most articles suggest that approach from what I have read. He should also be doing non-opiate treatments like antiseizure meds or antidepressants, both of which have been shown to be useful in treating chronic pain. You should also be using non-drug approaches like PT, OT, cognitive behavioral therapy, biofeedback, etc., etc. It is not always just about taking more opiates. I have used pain.com for some good articles about pain management, you might try there. ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"" is an excellent book, I found it very useful. Dr. Margaret A. Caudill, MD, PhD is the author. Take care, Annette""The URL for pain.com is www.pain.com. Take care, Annette""Is your doctor willing to increase your fentanyl dose? I agree with you that a breakthrough med seems more reasonable, but I have read in my research that some doctors do not use them. They prefer their patients to keep their long acting med dosed high enough so they don<APO>t need breakthrough meds. They seem to feel that removing the clock-watching or awareness of needing another pill is a better solution than adding another pill to take. I always approach my doctor for an adjustment in meds by telling her that I am unable to do a particular activity and that I need help to lower my pain levels so that I can continue to volunteer, for instance. Associating my need to function better with my med adjustment, rather than my pain levels, just seems to work better for me. Explain, if you haven<APO>t already, that you need better pain control so you can complete PT, or specific home activities that you need to do. Sometimes if you can get over the hump at a certain point with pain, you can lower your opiate levels after wards. I have done that. You also sound really depressed, as most of us would be, if your current antidepressant is not working for you after adjusting the dose several times, perhaps you need a different one? Or face to face therapy, if you aren<APO>t doing that already also? I don<APO>t know you at all, so please excuse me if I suggest something you have already tried, or give you information you already know about. I know I have read previous posts of yours, but I do not always remember everything I have read. No offense is ever intended. Take care, Annette""I may be way off, I apologize in advance if I am. You mentioned ""past abuse"" and that you ""know from experience that I am not addicted"". So here goes nothing... If you have had substance abuse or addiction problems in the past, the doctors may be considering that when they decide not to give you BT meds. The short acting BT meds are much more likely to trigger addictive behavior, especially in a recovering addict. Using the patch is probably a much better idea in regard to addiction recovery. If I misunderstood you, disregard this whole post. Take care, Annette""You wrote that your dad threatened to get the law involved, I took that to mean the police, my mistake. But threatening doctors with calling lawyers will rarely get you what you want either. Urine specimens for a random drug screen require a minimum amount of urine, just like any kind of urine lab test, if you can<APO>t provide that amount, they can<APO>t do the test. Same with blood, if they don<APO>t get enough, they would have to redraw it and try again. Many doctors who do random urine screens don<APO>t have contracts with labs to do blood screens, just the urine screens. You had trouble urinating and they let you leave and go have lunch and come back later. Where I used to work, you sat there until you urinated. It sounds like you tried to comply and they tried to work with you also. It seems to me that when you could not give them enough urine for the test, everyone lost their cool, the staff, and you and your dad. I would focus on preventing this from happening again. Make some kind of arrangement with your doctor that he writes down in your chart, what to do if they need a urine specimen and you cannot provide enough urine. If your doctor is unavailable and you would be getting the RX for clonazepam from one of the doctors in his group that you have not seen before, he HAS to see you by law. Doctors cannot prescribe controlled substances to people they have not seen, it is against the law. My doctor had emergency breast cancer surgery, and her associate took over for her, when I went in to pick up my RX refill at the pharmacy, I was told I had to call the doctor<APO>s office first. I had to go in and meet the associate so he could write me a RX. Of course, I paid him for his time. It wasn<APO>t his fault he had to see me. In your situation, I would ask your own doctor later if you could work out something for the fee since you don<APO>t feel it was entirely your fault. Perhaps you could offer to split the fee and only pay half? Take care, Annette""I am sure there is more to the story than that. However, 30 days is long enough to taper off the drugs if you needed to. That is the standard procedure that I am aware of if a doctor retires or dismisses a patient. A 30 day length of time with meds is the usual notice given. If a patient breaks the rules on a pain med contract, the doctor may dismiss them without giving them any meds at all. My doctor didn<APO>t have contracts when I started seeing her, so I filled mine out and signed it years after I was on meds. My husband<APO>s doctor also didn<APO>t have them until after my husband was on opiates for pain so he signed his after he was on the meds also. He has since been able to taper off, he had hip replacement surgery that fixed most of his pain. Find another doctor. Take care, Annette""I agree completely. If you can function off of opiates, go for it. ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"" is a great book by Dr. Margaret A. Caudill, MD, PhD. I found it very helpful in helping me learn to deal with chronic pain. Take care, Annette""I am so sorry for your loss of your grandpa, that is tough to deal with. I do not know what kind of contract if any, you signed when you started treatment with this doctor. Usually if a doctor does random urine tests, he has his patients sign an agreement that they will submit to that as asked. If you signed an agreement like that, then you are out of luck. The staff is just doing what they have been told to do by the doctors in charge. I worked in a drug addiction treatment program where we had to do observed random urine collections. It was not any more fun for the staff than it was for the patients. Everyone felt embarrassed about it. Some of the patients had what is called ""shy bladder syndrome"" and found it difficult to urinate in front of staff members. But, they could urinate alone. You did not mention that you have any problem urinating other than at the doctor<APO>s office, and that the doctor told you it was a ""mental thing"". What we did, was thoroughly search the client and allow him to go in the bathroom alone with nothing in his/her pockets, purse, etc. and give a specimen. This was only allowed after the patient saw the doctor in charge and he wrote an order giving those instructions to the staff. We often had to give clients huge amounts of water to drink to get a specimen. You might discuss this with your doctor the next time you see him. All you had to tell the office lady was that you cannot give a urine specimen and you need to discuss it with the doctor. All she was doing is what the doctor told her to do if a patient asked to see him/her. Everyone should have behaved more professionally it sounds like. I am sorry, but calling your dad to come in and then him threatening to call the police was just adding gas to the fire. The police cannot force a doctor to prescribe any kind of meds. Since you have some meds, I agree that I would probably taper them down slowly to avoid as much withdrawals as possible. You are correct in saying that the withdrawal from alprazolam is more dangerous than the withdrawal from opiates. (opiate withdrawal is unpleasant but not dangerous in itself) Benzo withdrawal can cause seizures which can be dangerous, but that depends on your dose and how often you take it. I have withdrawn from benzos abruptly and completely after taking them daily for many months. It was my choice to do so. It was unpleasant and after a week or so I went to my doctor. He provided a short taper of one of the short acting benzos, along with the ""I told you so"" look, which I deserved. The symptoms I had were nervousness, insomnia, and jumpy legs to the extreme, but nothing dangerous. Not even enough to make me go to the ER. If you develop any symptoms that you are concerned about call the doctor<APO>s office first, and ask them what to do, then if necessary go to the ER. I would not take any street drugs, as that would destroy your credibility completely. He may send you to a lab that draws blood to do a drug screen when you go in to see him, so be prepared for that. Just tell him what happened, since he is aware of your medical problems and problems urinating easily it should come as no surprise to him. This is how I would approach him: ""What can we do now to keep this from happening again?"" I would tell him that I would like some privacy when speaking to the staff about my medical conditions and where can I do that next time? Ask what I should do next time they want to check me for a random drug test, can they do a blood test instead? Or a hair test? Can you write in my chart while I am watching what we should do next time I am asked for a specimen? If you signed a contract or agreement with the doctor saying you would provide urine when asked for a random test, make sure you change that contract. It is all the staff have to go by if the doctor is not there. See next post...""I also added to my contract with my doctor what I should do if she is unavailable and I have an emergency of some kind, and what I should do if I am going out of town when I am due to pick up my RXs. I made my contract a two way street. She had no problems with that. If you have specific suggestions as to how this can be better handled next time, tell the doctor. Above all else, be calm and non-threatening if you ever want to get narcotics from any doctor again. If you come off as hysterical or threatening, they may well note that in your chart and dismiss you from their practice. It can be very hard to find another doctor to care for you if that is written in your chart. Fair or not, that is how it is in most places. My understanding of the HIPAA laws are that they allow you to add a note to your medical records stating your side of things, but you are not allowed to remove their notes. The police officer probably got your phone number from the doctor<APO>s office when he was filling out his report. They are allowed to do that legally. It was nice of him to try and broker some kind of arrangement for your meds, even if he did not get you exactly what you wanted. Anyhow, that is what I would do. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""I would get the results of the MRI first. If it is normal then seeing a chiro might be reasonable. But there are certain back/spine problems that can be made worse by a chiro rather than better. Take care, Annette""You need to discuss all of this with a neurologist. I am not certain that your pain from sitting has anything to do with the C4, C5 spurring. I don<APO>t see how there would be a connection. I had a C5-6 discectomy and spur removal, the pain in the arm is understandable, but not the pain with sitting. You may have something else going on that you need to sort out. Take care, Annette""The EMG may be a good idea, it helps sort out whether any, and which nerves are being affected by the problems in your neck. I would get that prior to scheduling any cervical nerve root blocks. Once you get all the diagnostic work done, you can decide on a treatment plan. It is fine to get a second opinion if you feel the first doctor might be wrong, or is just blowing you off. Take care, Annette""You have to ask the doctor these questions? We can<APO>t possibly know what is in his mind. Write down all the questions you have and get answers before he has anything done. Take care, Annette""I personally believe that a combination of some drugs like those could possibly replace the hydrocodone you currently take. Tramadol comes in a long acting version now if you prefer not to take so many pills per day. Is she open to putting you on long acting opiates if the cocktail of drugs does not work? Addiction only occurs in about 5% of people who use their opiates as prescribed by their doctor for pain. I feel that is a low enough rate of addiction so that I don<APO>t worry about it. The problems happen when people take their pain meds to get high rather than to relieve pain. That, I do think about every day so I stay on the right path. If she does not feel comfortable treating pain that does not respond to non-opiates, can she refer you to someone who does? Go in with a positive attitude and try what she suggests, it may take awhile to find the right combination of drugs, but it will be worth it in the long run. Have a back up plan too, just so you don<APO>t fret about what could happen if it doesn<APO>t work. I don<APO>t know what kind of pain you have, but chronic pain is often life long so having a Plan B is reassuring and decreases anxiety which only makes pain worse. Take care, Annette""I totally understand about moving in this kind of economy. I would love to live near my son and his family so I could spend more time with the grandkids, but he lives in southern Calif, and there is no way we could afford to live there. I know I need the things we can have up here in Oregon, so I stay here. We moved to the Portland area from southern Oregon because my hubby could find work here with benefits. I loved living in the country, but realistically, we can<APO>t do that right now. Maybe some day we will be able to move back out in the sticks, lol. It is all about trade offs. Take care, Annette""I am so sorry you are still in so much pain. As I recall, and I may be wrong, weren<APO>t you diagnosed with RSD? I have not read/heard anywhere that amputation is an answer for this problem. I understand, and I am no expert, that the RSD pain just moves up the nerve to the stump left by the amputation. Do you have any studies or articles on this topic? I would love to learn more about this. I try to stay up to date on pain management techniques. Take care of yourself, you are a valued member of this board. Hugs, Annette""I hate doctors who are not fairly prompt. Sometimes it is out of their control, but usually it is not. To try to avoid this, I always make my appt. for the first one of the day. He may be late for my appt. if he is always late getting there, but at least he has not fallen farther and farther behind as the day goes on. I had an appt. with a new for me dematologist, I made my usual appt. for the first one of the day and waited for 45 minutes. I went back to the desk and asked for my copay back as I refused to wait any longer. They had called other patients back to see this doctor already, he was clearly overbooked. I asked the office lady if this was normal for him, and she told me yes. I took my money and left and never went back. I told my doctor, who referred him, and wrote a letter to him and to my insurance company. It made me feel better, I doubt it changed his habits. If you are in a situation where you have no choice, then I would at least arrange to have HIS first appt. of the day, it should help some. If he is late, tell him that you don<APO>t appreciate it at all. But, say it nicely. By the end of the day many doctors are running late, even the good ones. Radicular pain is pain along the radicular nerve, radiation neuropathy is nerve damage caused by radiation therapy. RLS is restless leg syndrome. Not sure what CPS is meant to stand for??? I don<APO>t know where your radiation tx. was. Take care, Annette""I wish I could take your pain for just one day, the day of your daughter<APO>s wedding. My son<APO>s wedding day was tough, but great. I did go and Google ""amputation for RSD"" and I found only negative articles about it. They all said it was not a useful treatment as the pain remains and often the surgery makes it spread. I understand feeling like you should do something, just anything that may give you a chance at decreasing your pain, but I also hope I would never actually do anything that was not supported as a viable treatment with medical evidence. Hang in there. Hugs, Annette PS, You are certainly not a ""worthless lump"".""I know you are feeling terrible right now, but I see it differently than you do. I see a doctor who feels strongly that you need surgery, and who feels he does not have any useful treatments to give you. So he is telling you to find another doctor who can help you. I don<APO>t really believe in repeating MRIs unless you have a really good reason to. My doctor did my last MRI because I all of a sudden had increased symptoms, and she wanted to see if I needed to see a surgeon or if she could continue to treat me medically safely. That was about 10 years ago. If the results of a test could not change my treatment plan, then I would not have the test. So, if I were in your case, and would refuse surgery no matter what, then I wouldn<APO>t have another MRI either, I would look for medical treatments. I DO think he should have given you your records within a month of getting a written request for them. I would send him another written request and give him two weeks this time, I would say something like ""I will be coming by on August 7th to pick them up, please have them ready."" Some doctors charge a copying/handling fee, be sure to ask about that so you can have it ready. Be sure you give your full name and your birth date when you request records. I would not give in for any surgery unless you feel really good about recovering from it. A patient who feels negative will have a poorer outcome than someone who feels positive about it. Take care, Annette""I wasn<APO>t implying that your previous surgeries failed due to your attitude, I was just agreeing that you should not go on and have more surgery now. As far as him not being allowed to practice in the local hospital, there are several ways that that can happen. Either, the doctor never applied for privileges, they expired, or he had them and did something wrong and they terminated him. I would definitely be upset if they terminated his privileges for cause. Lots of pain management doctors do not have privileges in the local hospital, unless they do procedures themselves that require a hospital setting. However, I am like you, I would want him to be able to attend to my pain needs if I were hospitalized for any reason. My doctor, an internist, is in a nearby town and does not have privileges in the hospital I would choose to go to here in my town, with my insurance. She does have privileges in her local hospital. I asked her what would happen if I went to my hospital of choice in the event of illness or accident. She explained that the hospital I liked had hospitalists on duty 24/7 at the hospital and that they usually take care of hospitalized patients. So, she would call them and give them report from my records, and then they would care for me until I were discharged, then they would speak to her and give her report and she would take over my outpatient care. A few years ago, I would not have liked this at all. But, now I understand how they work and really appreciate them being right at the hospital at all times, no chasing a doctor down over the phone. Where was your doctor going to send you to have a SCS put in or have back surgery done? If he doesn<APO>t have privileges, would he refer you to an associate? I totally agree with you about both kinds of surgery. I think the stats on both are so poor that unless I had tried all other methods of treatment, I would avoid them too. I hope you find a doctor at the Indian Clinic that is willing to work with you rather than try and just give you ultimatums. Take care, Annette""I know Prialt can only be given intrathecally, but I have never heard of it being given without installing a pain med pump first. Is the doctor going to give you a series of intrathecal injections of Prialt? I would ask him for articles in peer reviewed medical journals showing this is effective when used this way. Call me old fashioned, but I want proof that a certain med works at least most of the time, when used a certain way. I have not heard of it being used this way, that does not mean it has not been shown to be effective that way, just that I have never heard of it before. Please continue to post about your experiences with it, and please post any links he gives you to articles about using Prialt that way. Take care, and good luck! Annette""Prialt has also been shown to have a lot of possible side effects. Make sure you know what to be aware of prior to having this injection done. Take care, Annette""New pain is a warning from the body that something may be wrong. He needs to go to the doctor and have a complete examination. The doctor can also answer any questions that the two of you have about future health issues in light of his dad<APO>s health problems. Your husband may need to be screened for those problems at intervals so they can be caught and treated early rather than later. Take care, Annette""I have had these also, they are very painful. I developed them after getting constipated, so now I concentrate on avoiding constipation. I use a stool softener and a mild laxative, both over the counter. When was the last time you saw your doctor about these? The thing is to get them healed up, not just treat the pain. Take care, Annette""You have to find a doctor and keep seeing him/her. When you stop seeing them, they assume you are well. There are lots of dietary changes and medications you can try. That is something you need to discuss with your doctor. I did not use any creams or medicines specifically for the fissures, I just made sure my stools were soft and moving along, lol. Since your stools are already soft, I would see the doctor and ask him what to try next. Mine healed up once I got my constipation fixed, but it took along time. Take care, Annette""Life is hard on people without health insurance in this country. Go online to Google and put ""free/low cost medical clinic in <UD><UD><UD><UD><UD>(your town, state)"" in the search engine and see what is available. Volunteers in Medicine have some free clinics, you can also call Goodwill, Salvation Army, Catholic Charities, your county health dept. and ask all of them what they suggest. The last option is to go to your local ER and get seen there. That is the most expensive option, but they cannot refuse to see you, and the bill comes later. When the bill does come, call the hospital business office and ask them about a discount plan for the medically indigent (uninsured, can<APO>t afford to pay). All hospitals who accept Medicaid/Medicare must do some free or discounted indigent care. There is no way of knowing in advance if or how much of a discount they will give you. They will also usually set up a payment plan so you can pay your bill a bit each month. You really need to see a doctor. If you use tobacco in any form, quit. Take care, Annette""I would see a neurologist that deals with headaches also. Take care, Annette""This is something to ask your doctor. I take a long acting morphine on a set schedule, and a generic vicodin for BT pain. I have on occasion taken them at the same time if I am in a lot of pain. I don<APO>t believe there is any problem taking them close together if you need to. Talk to your doctor about how you use your meds. Don<APO>t let the pain get really bad before you use your BT meds, it is harder to bring it down to a managable level when it is way bad, than it is to keep it lower by taking the meds properly. Take care, Annette""Glad to be of any help at all. You can also ask your pharmacist this question. Not all pharmacists are really helpful, but some of mine have been wonderful. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know if you will ever be the same as you were prior to your surgeries again. You will need to sort that out, and then learn to deal with what you have. I would not recommend any kind of implanted device for pain management until you have exhausted ALL other non-surgical methods, including daily meds and possibly opiates. With proper pain management, you should be able to play with your grandkids, don<APO>t know about swimming, baseball etc. But then my mom never learned to swim and she still took my son to the pool so he could swim in the shallow end of the pool. She made sure she had the big hook on a pole handy if she needed it, or went with a friend who did swim, same as she did when I was a kid. Get your depression treated as well as your pain, they do interact and if you have both, you need to treat both. I found ""Managing Pain Before It Manages You"" by Dr. Margaret Caudill, MD, PhD to be very helpful in learning to deal with chronic pain. ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns, MD teaches you how to use cognitive behavioral techniques to improve mood disorders like depression. Also an excellent book that helped me a lot. Take care, Annette""I am sure Charles will also respond, but here is my experience. I find the long acting opiates do work for 12 hours for me, but some people prefer to take them every 8 hours. I don<APO>t think you should ""feel them"" start to work. If you are on the correct dose, you should just feel better and use the breakthrough meds less. I think 2-3 days on a new dose is long enough to know if the dose is working well for you. If it isn<APO>t, just go see the doctor and explain to him just how you are taking them and what your pain levels are. It may help to keep a journal for awhile. I approach my doctor with whatever decrease in function I may have in response to the pain, rather than just saying I have more pain than I want to have. Most references I have read suggest one should only need 1-2 breakthrough doses per day, but that depends on how you and your doctor wish to do it. I would expect to have more frequent appts with the doctor while sorting this out. If he prefers you deal with him over the phone about meds, you can do that. I just personally think it is a lousy way to handle med increases. I would also put off the knee replacements for as long as possible because they do keep improving the prosthetics and the surgical techniques. Take care, Annette""Don<APO>t mix alcohol with over the counter pain killers. It makes any bleeding worse if you are on ibuprofen, and if you mix alcohol with tylenol you can kill your liver. I is just not safe. I would stop drinking, at least for now. Stop the advil until you see a doctor about the bleeding you are having. I don<APO>t know why you have pain or what kind of ""bleeding"" you are having. Explain to the new doctor just how you have been controlling your pain. Tell him how much you normally drink (alcohol) each day, and please be honest with him, it is very important. You may need a RX med to help control your pain, there are many available, opiates and non-opiates. Antiseizure meds and antidepressant meds are both used for chronic pain as they mediate the neurotransmitters that carry the pain signals to the brain. The doctors don<APO>t give them to us because they think it is all in our heads. Muscle relaxants are also sometime used. Take care, Annette""Perhaps the doctor can prescribe some other type of pain meds for you. Tramadol does not cause sedation in most people, so lots of people take it and continue to work, drive, etc. If you start anything new, first try it on a day when you don<APO>t have to work to see how you respond to it. Good luck with everything. Take care, Annette""It is not a narcotic, it is an antiseizure med that is commonly used for pain management. I use it and have for many years. You take it on a set schedule not as needed when you have pain. I also have FMS, there is no blood test or xray for it. The doctor does a history and physical exam including a tender point exam and you are diagnosed based on that, and the fact that other tests the doctor did do not show that you have any other illness that could cause these symptoms. I really like www.myalgia.com for good medical information about FMS. Take care, Annette""I personally would decline. At the least, please ask them for articles in peer reviewed medical journals that support its use and efficacy in patients like you who do not respond well to facet block injections. Do your doctors do mainly injections and procedures or do they use other non-invasive things to treat your pain? Are you doing PT, OT, oral meds, opiates, cognitive therapy, biofeedback, massage, etc.? I believe that if you get a small amount of relief from each of several different therapies, the total amount of relief may well be worthwhile. I also believe that any invasive treatments, including injections, should only be tried when all more conservative treatments have failed. Take care, Annette""I am also confused about what was said by the orthopedist. Please remember that unless you suddenly have bowel or bladder incontinence, this is not an emergency procedure. So do all your research, get all your questions answered and get second and maybe even third opinions. Then decide what to do. You are taking xanax, ativan, and Librium for your anxiety? Be sure to tell all your doctors about these meds before you take any kind of anesthetic for a procedure, even a ""go home the same day"" procedure. Be ready to tell him exactly how often you take all your meds, and what doses, as well as the last time you took them. Write it down. If you have an anesthesiologist for the procedure, be sure and tell him too. Take care, Annette""I would go with pain management until she can<APO>t take it anymore. My hubby had a hip replacement at age 64, and it was a miracle for him. The pain mostly stopped, he was tall again, and walked normally. He used pain meds for over a year prior to doing the surgery. The lifetime of a hip replacement varies with the individual. He was told 15-20 years, and felt he would probably die before he needed it revised. However, even if he had to have another one in 10 years, he would still do it again. I would wait as long as she feels she can. The prosthetic devices and the technique of putting them in is constantly changing and improving, and by waiting as long as possible, she may get a better hip than she would by doing it right away. Only she knows when the right time is for her, just be supportive. Take care, Annette""Sounds like you are having a relatively new surgery, or at least they are using new technology. I would trust that the boot they use to pull your hip open would work to protect your ankle. When we applied traction to a person<APO>s leg after they broke their hip to relieve pain while they waited for surgery, we used a particular technique to pull on the leg without pulling on the foot or ankle. It sounds similar to me. They pulled my husband<APO>s hip way apart to replace his hip, he suffered no nerve damage, but the doctor warned him about that also. They should to warn you about all possible risks, I worry more about the surgeons who always say ""Everything will be just fine, leave the worrying up to me."" I don<APO>t trust those guys at all, lol. The time frames he is giving you to get back to the various activities you mentioned sound about right to me. Remember that some people do them sooner and some take longer, just do what feels right for you. You have had surgery before, and you already know what to do. Take care, Annette""I will cross all my fingers and light a candle for you, lol. But, you won<APO>t need all that. I hope your surgery goes well, and you recover quickly. My husband had his hip replaced just about a year ago, it was too far gone for a scope. But he recovered very quickly, and he is 65. He was back to work as a big truck mechanic in 8 weeks. I know it is not a common surgery that you are having, but can<APO>t your doctor give you any idea of what your recovery experience should be like? Take care, Annette Take care, Annette""My son was in the Marines for eight years. He is out now. Three deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq. It can be a difficult life, how can you do their activities with a bum hip? What kind of hip surgery did you have? Take care, Annette""I went to my hearing in southern Oregon. The judge was very nice, he looked over my records, asked me some questions about my day to day functioning, listened carefully to me when I spoke, and approved my case then and there. My lawyer said that was unusual here. The whole thing took 14 months, from my initial application to my hearing and approval and subsequent check. This was about 10-12 years ago, so hopefully thing have improved timewise. I was told by SSA on the phone that the shortest wait was in South Dakota at that time, about 3 months to get a hearing, vs. 8 months where I was. My lawyer was surprised we got a hearing so fast, she had said 18-24 months was usual back then. Best of luck to you. Take care, Annette""As long as you are willing to take her money, she is free to put conditions on it. She sees you in dire straights financially, and is lending you money, you are selling stuff and buying smokes??? She knows that if you weren<APO>t buying smokes, you could put that money to better use. Smokes are VERY expensive. A friend of mine who quit after smoking for 35 years was spending nearly $300 a month between her and her partner. If you can afford to give her some of your food stamps, then you shouldn<APO>t be getting them to begin with. Nice of you to offer them to her though. It isn<APO>t a matter of being fair, it is a matter of if you want to borrow her money, you play be her rules. It doesn<APO>t matter if you feel she is trying to control you, if you don<APO>t like it all you have to do is stop taking her money. If you got a loan from a bank, you would have to pay interest, think of this as her way of charging you interest. If you feel she tries to control you in other ways, I might be more sympathetic. But, no one can control you if you don<APO>t allow it. There are two of you smoking from what you posted. I am sorry but if you are nearing foreclosure, you two can no longer afford to smoke. You need to use your money, wherever it comes from for other things. Besides, you are right, it is really bad for your health. Try your public library for books and other info on how to quit smoking, at least until you can afford to smoke and provide for your other needs also. You probably wish you hadn<APO>t asked me for my opinion on this one, lol. Take care, Annette""If you are in therapy for these kinds of issues with your mom, you should discuss this with your therapist. If your therapists have all told you you have a toxic relationship with her and that she is trying to control you, then it seems to me even more important that you not accept money from her. I personally would tear up the checks, or mail them back to her, and refuse gently, but adamantly to accept any more money from her. It sounds to me like this money does have strings attached, that it is not healthy for you to be in a dependent relationship like that with her, you are both adults. She cannot force you to take money from her, you can always return it, even if she sneaks it into your purse. In future maybe take your purse with you to the ladies room, lol. Another concern I have is her age, she may have some dementia or medical problems that are preventing her from thinking clearly about managing her finances. I would tell her she can leave her money to whomever she wants to when she dies, but I will no longer take money from her while we are both alive. She should be putting this money away for her own use as needed, or like you said, give it to her church herself. I might also make sure she sees her own medical doctor for a checkup. Take care, Annette""Unfortunately, I have heard of swelling in the lower extremities as a side effect of some opiates, as well as some other medications. I believe the only way of finding out if that is what it is, is to taper down and off the drugs. I have read other people post here that they did that and the swelling went away. Since you have seen a vascular surgeon and he and two other pain management doctors all agree, I feel it must be considered as a possible reason for the swelling. It sounds like they did the appropriate testing, were all the tests normal? Did the ultra sound show any abnormalities in the vessels in your legs? It also sounds like they have given you the right advice about using compression hose, ice and elevation to treat this meantime. Hopefully, the Prialt will work for you and you will be able to decrease your opiate use. Please let me know how things go for you. Take care, Annette""I have never heard of using any kind of gel injections to break up scar tissue. The best way to find out more about it would be to ask your boss the name of the doctor/hospital where this was done and contact them to find out more. The problem is that some people just make more scar tissue than other people do. Surgery always causes scar tissue, and no one really knows how much they will have until after they have the surgery and go through the healing process. It is great that you are losing weight. I would try aquatic exercise, less chance of injury to the joints. Stationary bikes that you pedal with your arms burn calories without causing harm to your ankles. High impact things like football, trampolines, and jogging clearly are a bad idea. You had a serious injury and you will never have the ankle you had previous to that injury and surgery. I don<APO>t know about the P90x program, what is it? Take care, Annette""Doing ""lysis of adhesions"" or a surgical removal of scar tissue is difficult because of what Charles mentioned, many people just regrow more scar tissue. Some doctors do it successfully though, a friend of mine had it done after abdominal scarring inside due to a C-section, and after the first two surgeries to clear up scar tissue, she did do worse. After the third one, she did fine. Her surgeon told her to forget all the stuff they had taught her about getting right up and moving postop. She was on bed rest for two weeks after surgery, only getting up to the bathroom. Then she was only allowed to very slowly increase her activity. I don<APO>t know if he was right, or if ""three<APO>s the charm"". But it has been 25 years and she has done fine ever since. I think the magic is in picking the right patient, at the right time, doing the right procedure, AND lucking out. I think I would probably only have it done if it were coming up on an emergency if I didn<APO>t have it done. Take care, Annette""Your boss must know the name of his own doctor??? You could call the doctor<APO>s office directly and get the name of the procedure. So, is the P90x a workout program for losing weight then? Do you get permission from your doctor to make sure your body is up to this workout? Take care, Annette""A laminectomy is the surgical removal of bony parts of the vertebrae, performed to relieve compression of the spinal cord. It is not anything related to an injection to break up scar tissue. Take care, Annette""I just saw the infomercial for the P90x exercise program. This is a VERY vigorous workout program, please get your doctor<APO>s permission to do it, or his suggestions on how to modify it to make it safe for you. Take care, Annette""I<APO>ve never had any problems with my lower back, but I had a discectomy in my cervical spine back in 1992. That, FMS and migraines are my main pain conditions. The FMS is my biggest pain problem. Just post any questions you have and I will answer when I can. I usually check my computer late at night, early in the AM. Being here this time of day is unusual for me. I get the email digests so I usually post only once a day. Take care, Annette""I really don<APO>t know if the dentist<APO>s injections triggered the FMS or not. I do know that if he had that much trouble the first time, I would have changed dentists the second time, lol. I am psycho about dentists, I would truly rather have spinal surgery again than go to the dentist. I have never had a terrible experience, I just don<APO>t like the loss of control and having someone else put power tools in my mouth. About numbing nerves in general: As an ER nurse, I have assisted with many doctors giving injections to numb a small area,or even a whole arm in order to do procedures like sutures or fix a dislocation. It would be really nice if we all had our nerves in exactly the same place like in anatomy books. However, we don<APO>t. Some of us have nerves in slightly different places. When you consider that a doctor/dentist has to place the medicine with a tiny little needle right to the nerve he wants to numb, we are lucky it ever works. An ER doc that I knew and respected wanted to do a nerve block on me to numb my finger to lance an abscess at the edge of my fingernail. I told him to just lance the abscess quickly and forget about the nerve block so we could both go home and go to sleep. We had worked the night shift together. He said he just could not do that to someone he liked as well as he did me without numbing it first. So, we spent 30 minutes, with multiple injections, and it never did get numb. I KNOW he knew what he was doing, I had seen him do it 100 times before. The nerve to my finger just isn<APO>t where it is supposed to be according to the books. He ended up just lancing the abscess and draining it without numbing it. As I suspected, it already hurt so bad that the little cut he made did not hurt. As soon as it was done, and the pressure released as it drained, it stopped hurting. I never did end up with a numb finger, lol. They say that any kind of traumatic event, physical or emotional can trigger FMS. I personally do not worry about what caused my FMS to begin bothering me, I have it, and now I deal with it. Stick around for awhile and see it you don<APO>t fit in here. We are very different from the FMS Board here. We are much more medically oriented, with a little social posting thrown in. I feel the posting here is much more positive and goal oriented. I fit better here than I do there. I tend to just say what I have to say, and keep my mouth shut if I don<APO>t have anything to add to the thread. If I read that someone else has already posted what I would say, I may not post at all. If you ever need me personally, stick my name in the heading to get my attention. I am happy to share whatever I have learned along the road of life and from my nursing experience. I have some medical text books, drug handbooks for nurses, etc. I am glad to look something up and share it if I can. Take care, Annette""The infections that people get right around the edge of their fingernails are really common. They usually clear up as soon as they are lanced, I didn<APO>t even take antibiotics. They aren<APO>t like the MRSA infections you read about now. MS and Lupus are autoimmune illnesses not infectious ones. FMS is not an infectious disease either so there wasn<APO>t some point at which I caught it from something that happened at work, anymore than your friends caught their illnesses at work. I don<APO>t worry about new vaccines as much as I do about new medicines that we have many other alternative meds that we could use instead. I don<APO>t try new medicines until they have been widely prescribed for at least five years. The illnesses that the vaccines prevent are much more dangerous than the vaccines are. My brother had chickenpox and developed encephalitis from it. I would have much rather my son dealt with a vaccine reaction than something that could kill him, but he ended up having chickenpox too because the vaccine was not out when he was that age. Gardisil prevents some HPV infections that can cause cervical cancer. That can cause death as easily as chickenpox can. I am not sure why you hesitate with one and didn<APO>t with the other? I really believe that most parents do not want to think of their little girls having sex. They feel that somehow if they give them the vaccine they are telling the kids it is okay to have sex. It isn<APO>t, you are just telling her she needs to take care of herself for when she is a grownup. I have to say that if I had a daughter that was 12 years old now, I would opt for the vaccine. Trust me as an old ER nurse, there is no way that any parent can know if their child is sexually active or not. It does not matter how well you think you know your child or how sure you are that they would come and talk to you before becoming sexually active, most of the time, they do not discuss it with their parents until after the fact. Then it is too late for Gardisil. HPV is so prevalent these days that even if you do not have symptoms, most sexually active people are positive for the virus. Even if she is not sexually active, she could be sexually assaulted, that would force the issue. Then it is too late to protect her. But, that is a decision for all parents to make for their own kids. You will have to ask your son<APO>s doctor about if he needs a chicken pox booster or not. I just haven<APO>t had any need to keep up with the vaccine schedules, my son is 31 years old. Take care, Annette""I believe that FMS mainly makes any little pain you have anywhere much worse than it would be without it. Plus of course, it gives you some additional pain of its own. I can tell the FMS pain from the pain I get from my neck down the nerves to my arms from my cervical disc herniation. It just feels different, the disc pain feels deep under my scapula, and I can follow it down the nerve pathway to my hands. FMS pain is more random, comes and goes, and is mainly in my hips/legs, although I do have some up my back and in my left arm. I have another disc in my neck that herniated six months after I had surgery on the one above it. I opted not to have surgery, because my neurosurgeon at the time refused to any spinal surgery for pain alone. He felt the possible risks far outweighed the possible benefits. He felt the odds on relieving pain were poor. Everything I have read since then says the same thing. I don<APO>t think that will change until they can figure out the right way to choose patients for spinal surgery, at this point they have no test that will tell you for sure the pain is from a specific place in the spine that they can operate on. They did a huge study on MRIs of the spine. They found that many people had terrible disc disease in the spine, but had no symptoms at all. And many people had absolutely normal spines, and had terrible pain. And some had MRIs that matched up DDD with pain. Even conservative studies have found that people who have disc disease symptoms who have surgery do no better than people with symptoms who do not have surgery, at the two year mark. They have about the same amount of pain in both groups and importantly, the study also said that there was no nerve damage done by waiting out the two years. The nerves did not deteriorate to the point where additional damage was done. This used to be a big selling point for surgeons, they would threaten that we would cross some magic line and then it would be too late. That does not seem to be true. With low back pain, and DDD, you do have to be aware that if you develop bowel or bladder incontinence, that might be a medical emergency and should be checked out immediately. At that point you may really have to have surgery. I didn<APO>t have FMS back then. That was in 1993, and nothing got any worse by not doing anything. I had lost some function in my hands when he operated on the C5-6 disc that was herniated. The function returned, so I considered the operation a success. I never did do anything about the second herniation because I never developed any functional deficits. A friend of mine has carpal tunnel and FMS, her neurologist did an EMG test a few years back, and told her most of her pain was from the FMS not the carpal tunnel and that CT surgery would not help her much. She didn<APO>t do it. I don<APO>t know if that would be helpful for a back problem and FMS, but you might ask your neurologist. Take care, Annette PS, If you ever decide to have surgery, let me know. I will send you a link to a site that discusses surgery on FMS patients and how to avoid a flare due to the surgery itself.""Go to www.myalgia.com, and there is an article there about having surgery when you also have FMS. Read it and print it out to take to your surgeon and anesthesiologist if you decide to have surgery. Take care, Annette""I guess one way I can tell which is bothering me is to just try and wait it out. My left hip was VERY painful for about six weeks, just about the time I decided to go to the doctor because I thought maybe it wasn<APO>t the FMS, the pain moved entirely to a different part of my left leg, the hip doesn<APO>t hurt at all. FMS is famous for widespread pain that travels from one part of the body to another. I think pain caused by a spinal problem pretty much stays in the same place all the time. Mine was always along the pathway of the nerve that goes from the cervical spine, beneath the scapula, and down the arm to the hand. FMS exacerbates any pain you have. So, if you have neck pain from a spinal disc, it might feel much worse due to the FMS than it would be if you didn<APO>t have it, and only had the spinal problem. Because I truly believe that surgery is rarely the answer for treating pain due to spinal discs, I would wait for a loss of function before going the surgical route. But, that is my personal decision. Because it does work for a limited number of people everyone has to make that choice for themselves. FMS just makes it that much more difficult. I wish I could give you some kind of definite answer. Take care, Annette""I would ask my pharmacist what kind of pain meds are compatible with Gleevec. If he doesn<APO>t know, he can find out for you. Then go to your doctor and tell him what you found out. I hear that Geevec is a real wonder drug, the doctor who developed it works at the medical center near us where my hubby had his hip replaced. I hope you are doing well with your CML. A friend of my mom<APO>s was diagnosed with it at least 20 years ago, she is 93 now. If you do half as well as she has, you will be fine. Take care, Annette""CML is chronic myeloid leukemia. Gleevec is a fairly new drug developed for leukemia, but now used off label for a number of different kinds of cancer. It is an oral anti-neoplastic agent. It is way out of my area of expertise, I would not pretend to know much more about it than I have read in medical and nursing journals. Take care, Annette""A ""bruit"" in the carotid artery is an abnormal sound when the doctor listens over the artery with his stethoscope. In my experience that sound is often associated with a narrowing of the carotid artery. As long as you don<APO>t have other significant symptoms it doesn<APO>t mean much. I assume they did an ultrasound of your carotid arteries and that is when they found the scar tissue. Do they think the scar tissue will keep growing or do they think it is stable at this time? Doing additional surgery is problematic in that you have already found that your body creates more scar tissue than normal. Are you seeing a pain management specialist for your leg pain? You are probably pretty isolated out on the island, it may be hard to access medical care there. Keep up the fight for SSDI, it seems like the people to keep fighting eventually get it. Take care, Annette""Welcome to this board. It is always nice to have another nurse around, especially one who has chronic pain and deals with it successfully. Hugs, Annette""I beg to differ. Sciatica is a swelling or inflammation of the sciatic nerve. That nerve runs from the spine, through the muscles of the thigh, leg and foot. Sciatica can be caused by many things, not just a nerve root compression. I have had sciatica twice, once it was caused by an injection a nurse gave me in the back/side of the hip area. I knew the second she stuck the needle in she placed it wrong. The second time we never knew the cause. We did not jump to an MRI or expensive test, the doctor took a good history and did a thorough examination. I had an MRI later of my lower spine and have healthy discs, nerve root foramin spaces, etc. All of my spine problems are confined to my neck. Anyhow, both times my pcp put me on a short course of oral steroids, prednisone. I took them for two weeks along with the NSAIDs. The sciatica cleared up. I have not had it now in about 15 years. Of course, I agree with Charles that diagnostic work is important if the cause of the sciatica is unclear or if it does not clear up within a reasonable amount of time. Take care, Annette""I have not taken care of anyone myself who only had pain in the lower leg/foot, but my understanding of the problem is that it would be possible. It would depend on where the nerve is irritated. This is a good question to ask your neurologist. Take care, Annette""Peacemonger is correct. Most institutions have indigent care assistance. Any of them that accept Medicaid or Medicare are required by law to donate a certain amount of indigent care. The hard part is that for the ER, at least, they don<APO>t have to tell you until after you get the bill if you are eligible for any help. In our city, the hospitals have folks in the business office that will try and hook you up to any programs they have. You just have to call the business office and ask for help. They want to get paid by someone, and if you can<APO>t pay, they get nothing. Best of luck. Annette""Before assuming it is the CRPS that is spreading, I would ask the doctor to check out other possibilities. Lots of things cause joint pain, if your pcp can<APO>t figure it out, ask your neurologist to see what he thinks, or see a rheumatologist to check out for arthritis of some kind. CRPS is more than just pain, do you have any skin changes in those other areas where you are having increased pain? Take care, Annette""I would seriously get it checked out for other possible causes if you have no skin changes that lead one to assume it is CRPS. Many things can cause pain. Take care, Annette""Just a thought. If your foot is numb, it throws off your gait completely. If you can<APO>t feel the bottom of your foot and your toes, your brain does not get the messages about your position and doesn<APO>t know what to do to walk properly. I totally understand your feelings about numbness is better than pain. Ask the doctor to show you what areas of your foot would be numb if you had the nerve severed, and how that would affect walking. Do you have an extra bedroom in your house? I have had household help a number of times over the years to help by watching my son overnight while I worked graveyard shift. I traded room and board for child care. I never had a problem finding people, I did screen rigorously and checked references, etc. I treated it like the serious job it was, taking care of my child. One lady stayed with me for four years, we got to be great friends. I had to get past the thing about having a stranger in my house, but they weren<APO>t strangers for long, lol. Hugs, Annette""I didn<APO>t rent it for money, I exchanged the room for work (in my case, child care or housekeeping). I wrote a contract and checked work references just like I would have for any job. In my state, I did not have to pay into SS or W/C because I was not paying the person any money, it was a trade room for services rendered. But you might want to talk to a lawyer in your state first. If I rented a room, I would get first and last, and a security deposit, just like renting a house. That way you can start eviction proceedings as soon as they are late with their rent. I would not accept church people for references, because they always seem to say good things, no matter what kind of person it is you are asking about. One guy interviewed and he had obvious jail tattoos up both arms, and swore to me he had never been to jail. He had needle tracks on both arms. He had a five year gap in job history, that he would not explain, and the pastor he gave me as a reference just kept saying he was sure he was a good guy, even though he had just met him the week before. I passed on that guy. Just be really careful, whatever you decide to do. Hugs, Annette""Swank is right. Hydrocodone comes in the strengths she said, and with varying amounts of tylenol added to it. The first number is the dose of hydrocodone and the second number is the dose of tylenol. If the med she is taking for her bipolar disorder is causing so much pain, why can<APO>t they put her on a different bipolar med? If they cannot for other medical reasons, then I agree with you, that they should control her pain, somehow. I don<APO>t understand why they don<APO>t want to give her just one pill a day. I would ask the doctor for a referral to a pain management doctor if he is unable to control her pain. To be fair, he may just not feel he has the education/training to manage chronic pain. Many doctors don<APO>t. Bless you for being such a great guy. Not all husbands go to the lengths you have to gather information and help their spouses in pain. Take care, Annette""You cannot get a medical diagnosis here. You need to go see your doctor and be evaluated. Once he gives you some hint as to what is going on, people here will be happy to tell you about their experiences if they are similar to yours, or if they have any suggestions. Take care, Annette""Once you get the lab work back and see how your body responds to the prednisone you will have a better idea of what you are dealing with. Please let us know what is going on when you get the labs back. The prednisone kick starts the anti-inflammatory process, then the naprosyn (an NSAID) takes over. Take care, Annette""Disengage is probably not the same as biofeedback. Biofeedback is something you are trained to do by a professional. I have not been trained in it. Charles has, he may be a better person to answer this question. Referrals to another doc are done when the doc you are seeing feels that the problem is out of his area of expertise, or that he has tried everything he knows to do and it hasn<APO>t worked. Some doctors have developed working relationships with specialists and will give you their names, but whether you use that doctor or not depends on your insurance coverage, distance you have to travel, or other things. Usually my doctor will tell me I need to see a specialist and ask me if I need help locating one. If so, she will offer me names. My insurance allows me to see a specialist without a referral, it is my choice whether to see one on their list, or pay more out of pocket to see one that is not on their list of preferred providers. Bed rest has not been recommended for back problems for many years, all the studies showed that it was both ineffective, and caused many adverse effects of its own. As little as three days of bed rest can weaken muscles in the back. I have no way of knowing if your R foot pain has anything to do with your back problems related to DDD. This topic is for you to discuss with your doctor. The rest of your concerns in this post and probably the following one addressed to me, are best met by your own doctors. There is no way any nurse should be addressing these concerns, especially on line with the limited information available and no ability to examine the patient. Nurses are not doctors. I am just a member of this community who happens to be a nurse. I offer information that I have acquired through nursing and from personal experience, I do not function here as a nurse taking care of my own patients. No one should should try to get medical care on line, that is why you have doctors. I am happy to offer general information only. Take care, Annette""Talk to your pcp and get a referral to a licensed nutritionist, not an alternative health person. She can discuss portion control and what kind of an eating plan you need to stay on to attain and stay at your best weight. You don<APO>t mention how tall you are, so I don<APO>t know if 110 is a desirable weight for you. Pregnancy does not just happen, nor does gaining huge amounts of weight while you are pregnant. I hope you are using birth control of some sort while you deal with your weight problem. It takes a full year for your body to recover from one pregnancy, having your children too close together is not always good for your own health and well being. Your math is off, or mine is, not sure which. But if you were 220 when you had your daughter, and after her you lost 20 pounds, you would weigh 200, not 180 by my reckoning. I really believe that weight gain/loss is a matter of calories in and calories out. Keep an accurate journal of EVERY bite you put in your mouth, and all the exercise you truly do at the gym or at home. Do this for at least a month. Take this to your doctor or the nutritionist and they should be able to help you get back on track. Some women who have large amounts of weight gain with pregnancy, or abdominal surgery may have the shape of their tummies changed forever, you may never be as flat as you were prior to having babies. A competent plastic surgeon will be honest with you about just what he can do. He may be able to tighten your tummy, but he cannot really fix all over weight gain. This is not the best board to post this on, ask Caprice if there is another board that is more tuned in to these kinds of problems. We deal mostly with pain management problems here. Take care, Annette""This is just my personal opinion, we all have one. Take it or leave it. I feel that most any opiate is likely to work as well as another for any one person. I feel it is more about dose than which drug to take. Your oxycodone would probably not work for you if you did not have the baseline MS Contin already in your blood stream. I believe that probably if the doctor gave you immediate release morphine in the correct dose you would also get relief. I feel most people will also respond to the fentanyl patch as the long acting opiate. Methadone is slightly different chemically from the other opioids, and some doctors feel it works a bit better for neuropathic pain than the others. But with a skilled doctor prescribing it, I feel it works as well as the others do for most chronic pain. It is the cheapest. Some medicaid insurance programs won<APO>t cover brand name Oxycontin, but will cover the generic of MS Contin strictly due to cost. You might ask him if that has anything to do with his choice of drugs. There may be appeals processes available in that case. In my experience as a nurse, I have found that often doctors have favorite drugs, not just for chronic pain, but for other health issues also. They have the experience and I generally would not ague with them about their choices. More than one drug will usually work for any given chronic medical problem. If adding 15 mg. of the MS Contin works, fine, if it does not work, go back and tell him that. I would never ask for a specific drug by name unless you have used that drug in the past and it worked. The long acting Oxycontin is a completely different delivery system than the short acting oxycodone. He may be correct about the delivery system for Oxycontin not being as reliable as the MS Contin, I don<APO>t know. So, I would defer to his experience for now. We are all going to have pain for a long, long time. I find it best to try and be patient and find the best combination of meds for each of me. We are all different and require different combos of meds for the best outcome. Take care, Annette""You go see your family doctor (not the ER) and explain to him what is going on. Once he examines you and hears your story he should be able to tell you what further testing you need, if any, and what kind of treatment to try. Over the counter pain meds like tylenol or ibuprofen can cause rebound headaches if taken too many days per week. My old neurologist told me no more than three days a week for those kinds of meds. Everything I have read since supports that. I do not know what you mean by ""frequent"". When my migraines came more than three or four per month, my doctor suggested preventative meds. These are meds that you take every day on a set schedule to prevent the migraines from coming in the first place. It often takes 3-4 weeks on each med to see if they will work well for you. Then you use a rescue med when you actually get a headache. If you have migraines, one of the migraine specific drugs might help. Again, you have to keep trying each med for awhile to see how well it will work. No meds are 100% effective. I am content if a migraine rescue med will work 75-80% of the time. I use three different types of rescue meds, and alternate them if necessary so I do not use any one of them more than three days per week. Fortunately, the preventative I use now works fairly well. By the way, my husband who had a history of migraines some years before developed a severe headache about eight years ago. He thought it was a migraine and tried to ride it out. I finally made him go to the doctor, and it turned out he had a bleed inside his head. He is fine now, but it could have killed him. Any new or different headache should always be evaluated by your doctor. It is good to have a primary care doctor who gets to know you so he will know your baseline of health. Then he is more likely to see if things are out of whack. As the two of you get to know each other, you will understand better what is a waste of his time and what is not. Take care, Annette""There is no such thing as a stupid question here. Many people get changes in their pain levels with changes in the barometer readings. I have had the same thing happen with migraines, I get more when the weather is changing, and they are worse. I believe there are actual medical studies that show this to be true with the connection of weather and chronic pain levels. I have used Lidoderm patches with fairly good effect, on top of all my other meds. They are my last ditch thing to try. They are very expensive, I would not use them if my insurance did not cover them. My hot tub is a life saver. I KNOW that my pain will improve while I am sitting in it, it doesn<APO>t last long after I get out, but sometimes long enough to fall asleep. I was able to deduct a portion of the cost of it on our income taxes as a medical expense. I did have to get a letter from my doctor saying it was medically necessary. Talk to your doctor, preferably in person and tell him what your pain levels have been like lately, and ask him what to try to help them. Take care, Annette""I would assume your doctor knows your medical history including risk factors for heart disease and stomach problems. Vicoprofen contains ibuprofen, as does the motrin you take at work. Make sure the total daily dose of ibuprofen stays within whatever limits the doctor has set for you. The risk of any medicine varies from person to person, what is the best thing for me to take long term may be different from what you should take long term. Your pharmacist is another good resource for information about your medicines. Take care, Annette""The effect on the baby depends on the dose and when in your pregnancy they are taken. Opiates should only be used under the supervision of the doctor, in proper doses and at the right time of the pregnancy, preferably not near the end when they can affect the baby<APO>s breathing. Talk to your OB doctor, not to strangers on line. Take care, Annette""Tramadol is the only drug in that class of meds. I would stick with it until it did not relieve my pain or until the side effects became intolerable. You are on the highest dose of tramadol allowed, 400 mg. per day. So the next choice might be a different med altogether. There is also a long acting tramadol available now, you might try that and see if a longer acting med might work better for you. Some people don<APO>t have the same side effects with a long acting drug, as the dose is slowly introduced into the system instead of dumped in all at once. You might discuss that with your doctor. If you go up to stronger meds like vicodin or percocet, the sweating may also happen. You won<APO>t know until you try. Everyone is different. When you have the hot flashes and your ears turn red, have you actually taken your temperature? How high does it go? I am curious is all. Tramadol can cause your veins to dilate, which makes your ears red, and makes your skin feel hot, but that doesn<APO>t necessarily mean your core temperature is higher. I had sweats really bad years ago when I first started taking opiates daily, but it did go away after awhile. Maybe yours will too? Take care, Annette""Everyone has a different opinion on this topic. I truly believe that generics of any kind work just fine. I only get generics when they are available, because I believe they work, and I believe in controlling the cost of drugs. I have great insurance and if I wished, I could get name brand meds for only a bit more in price. I have read all the same stuff you have probably. But, in fact over the years I have used many different generics makers of many different meds, including opiates. I have used five or six different brands of Vicodin, the brand name one, and the rest all generics, and they all worked just fine.I have never noticed any difference at all. I have read the info about generics only needing to contain 20% more or less than the brand name drugs do. That seemed curious to me, as it is easy nowadays to calibrate machinery to get EXACT amounts of anything in pill form. I went to fda.gov, website for the FDA, and clicked on their links to information about generic drugs. Everything there says they must be exactly the same chemical, in exactly the same amount, and they must work in the same amount of time as the brand name drugs. Nothing there that I could find said they only had to be within 20% of the same dose as the brand name drug. My friend works for a big generic drug maker, Watson, in the adverse effects department. She has also worked in the labs of drug companies. When I told her that ""20%"" info, she just laughed and said it was crazy, she also told me that they deal in exact doses. She also told me that they save out part of each lot of drugs they make, so that if anyone has a problem with them, they can test some of the same pills in that lot number. Generics are tested in double blind studies to make certain they work the same as the brand name drugs before they are approved by the FDA. The main difference is cost. Brand name drugs cost more. People just think the more expensive ones must be better for pain. A recent drug study showed that if you told patients that the pill they were given for their pain was 29 cents a piece, the average relief was less than those they told the patients were several dollars a piece. This was in spite of the fact that all the patients were given exactly the same thing. I feel double blind studies like this one prove that we have been brain washed into thinking the more expensive pills work better. So, I stick with the generics, I had never even read the name of the manufacturer on my meds until all this talk about generics came up. I just knew the color and shape was often different. The pharmacist would always tell me to expect that and it was the same thing. I recommend people to go to the fda.gov website and read for themselves. I have always asked anyone who has any links to randomized, double blind studies that show the generics are not as good as the brand name drugs to please post them, so I can go read them. No one has ever done that. Take care, Annette""I went to the FDA website and did not find that they permit this. They state that the generic drugs must have exactly the same drug in the same amount as the brand name drug. I have seen 15%, 18%, 20%, and 25% quoted in various message boards as the variable allowed for generic pain meds. The dose of the meds, mg., is a specific weight measurement. This is easily achieved with the modern machinery that makes pills. Take care, Annette""Over the many years I have posted on this board, this conversation comes up frequently. One thing I have noticed now that many people have been exposed to certain generics prior to being exposed to the brand name drug is that often they had a good experience with the generic drug. Later, for whatever reason, they ended up with the brand name drug and they posted that they prefered the generic drug over the brand name drug. I can recall specifically that this has happened with the fentanyl patches vs. Duragesic Patches, and a couple of years ago, it happened with Oxycontin and a generic brand of extended release oxycodone. I think there are lots of things that make us comfortable with one drug over another. The only way to tell for sure if there is a difference is to use a double blind study (in which the meds look identical or are placed in gelcaps to look alike) where neither the doctor nor the patient know which medicine they are taking when. The data is then gathered by another person, and analyzed to determine what the comparison is. Take care, Annette""I just went and looked at my generic meds and one of them is from Mallinkrodt, I have noticed no difference at all. Pain is such a varying thing, I am not sure how one could tell if their pain was just worse, or if it really was the drug that was not working as well??? I do know that when my husband stops working and we lose that insurance and go on Medicare I will ask my doctor to switch me to methadone. It is the cheapest of all. That whole donut hole thing scares me to death. Drug companies are the same as drug dealers on the street as far as I am concerned. They are a bunch of gangsters, lol. I was paying $15 for each pill when Imitrex pills first came out. I was getting 3-5 migraines a week back then, and I had to fight with the insurance companies because they only wanted to allow patients to have 9 pills per month (due to the cost I am sure). I finally did all my own research on migraine treatment and found old, cheap drugs that worked just as well without the nasty side effects of the triptans. I haven<APO>t bought a triptan in many years now. My brother says that he got no relief from Percocet, but did from Vicodin when he had his wisdom teeth pulled. He took five Percocet within two hours without relief, and the next day spoke to his dentist who ordered the Vicodin. Two of those and he was back to his usual self. You have known me for a long time, I am a scientific kind of gal. I want to see randomized, double blind studies. If the name brand were really better than the other generic brands, then it would be worthwhile for the drug company making the brand name to do the study and publicize the results. That would make great TV ads. Insurance companies would be forced to provide the better drug if it were actually proven to work better. But, I don<APO>t see drug companies doing these kinds of studies, they are sharks, if they thought there were any money in it, they would do it. Take care, Annette""The reason you get less pain in the water is because the water supports your weight, so there is not as much pressure on your muscles and spine. Like the others say, addiction only happens to about 5% of the folks who take pain meds as directed by their doctors. That is not enough for me to worry about. I have been on pain meds daily for over ten years now, with no addiction problems. They have never made me high or given me a buzz, they just relieve some of the pain so I can function better. I have never taken more than I was prescribed or in a different way than the doctor instructed. Take care, Annette""Have you been to a urologist to have any possible bladder problems diagnosed? I would do that first. If he gives you the all clear, then speak to your back doctor. Take care, Annette""IC can be very painful. I am not really familiar with its treatment options. All I can suggest is to do the research and see what your choices are. It is hard to say where pain is coming from in the spine. They did a huge study, more than 700 people participated. They had MRIs on all of them. They found the MRIs did not predict pain at all. Many people had horrible disc disease, etc. according to their MRIs, and had no pain at all, many had absolutely normal MRIs and had horrible pain, and many fell somewhere in between. The conclusion was that MRIs do not predict pain symptoms in people with spinal problems. Maybe the doctor in Germany will find something. Maybe he also has a friend who is a urologist so you can get a second opinion there. I have FMS and I have irritable bladder syndrome along with it. That is common. It feels just like I have a UTI all the time, but I don<APO>t. You know I am sure, pain, frequent urination, etc. No fever though. I have taken antispasmodics and other meds for it. I used to urinate every 15-20 minutes ALL the time. I started taking neurontin for my FMS pain, and it seemed to help the irritable bladder syndrome too. I still have it and it flairs sometimes, but at least I can sit through a movie without getting up to go to the bathroom. Good luck with the doctor in Germany. I hope things go well for you there. Take care, Annette""I read about the study in Arthritis Today and also one of my nursing journals. I don<APO>t remember who did it, but it shouldn<APO>t be hard to find with a decent search engine. It was done this last year or so. I don<APO>t have ""horrible"" bladder pain, that sounds more like IC. Mine is more along the really annoying level. If you had a cystoscopy and the urologist found it, that is probably what you have. But check when you are in Germany. I think it is always good to get a second opinion. I slowly went up to 1800 mg. a day with the neurontin before it evened out my pain, then I went back down to 800 mg. a day. I cannot imagine that 100 mg. a day would do anything for anyone. My doctor told me her pain patients go up as high as 3200 mg. a day. My neurosurgeon did not do discograms. He did not feel the info was worth the pain. He felt between the MRIs and CT myelograom he could get the info he needed. I have flown for 7 hours, and my pain meds worked just as well as ever. Airplane cabins are pressurized now, so the pressure inside the plane is not relative to the altitude of the plane. Take care, Annette""Getting opiates from more than one doctor, without telling all the doctors about all the other doctors and what they prescribed is a felony in many states. Not just doctor shopping. Take care, Annette""It is totally subjective. ""Well managed"" is what works for you. I don<APO>t freak out about pain at all, guess I have gotten used to it. I would have to have other symptoms in addition to the pain to freak out. Vomiting makes me really freak out for instance, lol. I usually run pain scores of 5-6 and consider that doable for me. The pain occasionally spikes to 8-9, as long as it drops back to 5-6 or so after I take my BT meds, I do okay. I have a fairly high pain tolerance, many people do not tolerate those levels. What works for you is what works for you. Hang in there, and go to your daughter<APO>s wedding. My son got married a bit over three years ago, it was wonderful. I took some extra pain meds with me, and planned for a couple of weeks recovery time after I got home again. The distraction actually really helped me a lot. Talk to your doctor and ask him if he will give you some extra pain meds to take just in case you need them. Hugs, Annette""Many people need a cocktail of drugs to get the best possible relief. I only start one new drug at a time, give it a few days or a week, then start the next one, etc. Usually, the side effects start close to the beginning or after dose increases. Take care, Annette""I have never heard of this one. Personally, I know how well my meds work for me, so I don<APO>t need to know where they fall on someone else<APO>s chart. I have found that different patients respond differently to many meds, one might be stronger for one person than another, whereas, in another person, the opposite may be true. Morphine is not the strongest anyway, not mg. for mg. Take care, Annette""I went and read this list of meds. The ""study"" done by a non-medical person must be many, many years old. The information is faulty. Oxycodone and Norco have been around for well over 15 years, I have personally taken them that long. Some of the other drugs are newer than that and he had scores for them. Fentanyl is far stronger than morphine or demerol. Take care, Annette The author states he estimated results of drugs that were not available at the time of the study. How can he do that?""Sorry, I just don<APO>t think this chart would be very useful in real life. I don<APO>t believe it is necessarily the type of opiate that is as important as the dose you were given. If you got 5 mg. of oxycodone, and it did not work, 7.5 mg. or 10 mg. may work really well. This chart puts many doses in the same box with the same score. That is crazy. Also different opiates require completely different dosing schedules to get the same result. There is never any reason to try any opiate for months if it does not work. Even with the long acting meds like oxycontin or MS Contin you should be able to adjust the dose to work within a few days to a week at most. Also different classes of drugs work differently. So, depending on what is causing your pain, you may respond better to a combination of meds. Many people need both an opiate for the pain, and an NSAID for inflammation if inflammation is causing the pain. I think you are better off keeping good personal records of what you have tried and the doses you took and why you stopped taking them. Side effects, efficacy, etc. Show that to any new doctor when he gets out his RX pad. Take care, Annette""I have never had a discogram. I had a CT myelogram once, and it was not painful at all. I had an experienced anesthesiologist put in the spinal needle under flouroscopy. The local anesthetic burned a bit like it always does, and the spinal needle going in was really just a feeling of pressure. The whole thing was a 2-3 on the 0-10 scale. After it was done, I felt a bit of a bruise where the needle went in for a week or so, but that was all. Take care, Annette""Wow, I must have had an excellent neurosurgeon. I had my C5-6 disc removed back in 1992. I was up the same day, showered the following day with tegaderm over my incision and a plastic bag over my arm with the IV. I would have gone home on postop day two except I ended up with a blood clot in my leg. I would not put my postop surgical pain at about a 5-6. I used IV pain meds for less than 24 hours, and switched to vicodin after that. We all perceive pain differently. I agree with Charles about getting a second opinion on the discogram. Take care, Annette""I just did my own research back when my migraines were my main problem. Doctors don<APO>t always have time to read journal articles. I feel opioids are the wrong approach. I found small studies with intriguing results. When I found one that looked good to me, I would print it out and take it to my doctor. If he felt it was a safe, reasonable thing to try, then we did. The doctors in the ER where I worked knew about my migraines and were kind enough to make suggestions when they took a class or came across something promising. I ended up using reglan 10 mg. with aspirin or ibuprofen as my first rescue attempt. It worked abut 75% of the time (nothing works all the time). I alternated that with compazine 10 mg. so I would not develop rebound headaches. If I woke up in the morning with a migraine, I went straight to a triptan, as I discovered with experience that only triptans worked for those particular migraines. The good thing about this approach is that if the first drug/combo does not work, you can go on to the next medicine, and even the third, all on the same day if necessary. I did not use anything more than three days per week to prevent rebounds. Since they all work differently the doctors felt this would help prevent rebounds. None of them sedated me once I got used to them, so I could take them and work and function if necessary. Only the triptan gave me side effects, and they only lasted about 20-30 minutes. For preventative meds, I just kept trying them until I found one that worked, then stuck with it until it stopped working. They worked on average a year or two for me. After you try them all one at a time, you can double them up and take two at a time. It can take years to try all the possible combinations. I am doing better with the migraines now, thank goodness. I don<APO>t know how well I would deal with them as bad as they were, on top of the FMS pain. I credit neurontin and menopause. They say the hormonal changes in menopausal women can help and in my case it did. I started the neurontin for the FMS pain and it seemed to really decrease the frequency and severity of the migraines. I have used it for 8-10 years now for the FMS pain, and the migraines have continued to be far less than before I started the neurontin. I would go to a doctor or clinic that specializes in headaches, and find a doctor you can work with, then just stick with him. Take care, Annette""Best of luck to you. I will light a candle, keep good thoughts for you on Friday. I think the positive attitude is the most important thing in the outcome of a surgery. I would advise you to think reduced pain, rather than pain free though. Pain free may be an unreasonable expectation. Take care and please do let us know how you are doing. Hugs, Annette""It took me awhile to deal with night times, and I still hate going to bed. I keep many pillows on the floor next to my bed, I use them to help me in positioning myself to maintain good alignment of my spine. I wake up about every 2-3 hours needing to turn over. I used to stay awake a long time each time I turned over. I have adjusted now so that I wake up, turn over, fix my pillows and go back to sleep pretty quickly. I keep my pain meds and a bottle of water on my nightstand so I don<APO>t have to get up to go get them at night. I do not keep the whole bottle of meds on my nightstand, because I might not take them properly while half asleep. I only put the dose I will need in a small pillbox on the nightstand. You might adjust your long acting meds to different times to see if that helps. I get good 12 hour coverage with generic MS Contin. Some people only get 8 hours coverage with MS Contin, discuss that with your doctor. Perhaps taking it in three doses a day would be better for you. Some people just give up and sleep in their recliners. I have not done that, don<APO>t have a recliner. Take care, Annette""There are two types of Lupus that I am aware of. Discoid Lupus affects only the skin from what I know of it, which is little, I am sorry. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is the type of Lupus that affects many parts of your body including organs. It can vary in severity from mild and managable to disabling. I believe there are specific blood tests that can be done to see if you have SLE. They do not always go together. Take care, Annette""I have used long acting morphine for about ten years now, with dosage adjustments every 3-4 years. The whole tolerance thing is different for everyone. Switching from one long acting med to another can take advantage of the partial cross tolerance between different types of opioids. It is possible that you will use less than the equianalgesic dose of the new medicine, whatever you choose to use. I personally do not think it matters much which one you choose to try next. I agree that methadone would be a good option, at least it is the one I would try next. It is old and cheap. The only caveat I have is to use a doctor who has a lot of experience prescribing it. It can be trickier to adjust at first because it is naturally so long acting. Other opiates are naturally short acting and the drug companies use special delivery systems so they are absorbed slowly into the body. The other thing is that you should NEVER adjust the dose yourself or take an ""extra"" pill because your pain is worse. It is much easier to overdose if patients try to self-prescribe and change the dose taken without the doctor knowing first. My hubby used it for two years at a steady dose, and then tapered off with no trouble whatsoever when his hip was replaced and he no longer needed it. He had used morphine and percocet many years ago for cancer pain and he much preferred the methadone. We are all different though. You may try it and hate it. Take care, Annette""Thank you, Charles. This is useful information for anyone considering or using interventional medicine for spinal pain. You know how I love evidence based studies!! Take care, Annette""This is a question that your lawyer should be able to answer for you. Take care, Annette""GAD stands for generalized anxiety disorder. Bipolar is a type of syndrome where you go through manic phases and depressed phases. Usually they come and go in cycles. Don<APO>t go looking it up and learning all about it until she actually gives you that diagnosis, it would just be one more thing to worry about. I think it is good that she is waiting until she gets to know you better to decide if you might be bipolar. That would make me think she is a competent doctor. Snap diagnoses are not a good thing. As far as putting your wallet in the fridge, I had to laugh. My mom did that once when my now 48 year old brother was about a year old. I was about 12, I am 59 now. She was getting ready to go to the store, and at the last minute fixed him a bottle and laid him down for his nap. Then she couldn<APO>t find her wallet. All four of us other kids were searching all over the house for it, while my mom & dad looked too. Mom refused to drive the car without her driver<APO>s license. Finally, someone opened the fridge and there it was, next to the milk. She had set it down to fill his bottle, and left it there. There was NOTHING wrong with her. We have all done something like that at some point in our lives. Don<APO>t worry about it. Hugs, Annette""I believe the reason the pump delivers such a small amount of the medication is because none is lost in the GI tract, liver, etc. It goes directly to the spinal fluid/brain. When you take oral opiates, most of the medicine is lost before it gets to the brain, only a very small amount actually goes to the brain where it does its work. You would still go into withdrawal if the pump were turned off or turned down substantially. I do not understand either why a doctor who knew what he was doing would turn the pump down to nearly off and put a person into withdrawal. Nor do I understand why a person would do this prior to knowing their Prialt had been approved by insurance, or whoever has to approve it in his case. If it were me, and I were going through this process, I would wait until the Prialt were totally approved and ready before I tapered slowly off of the opiates (if that is required prior to starting the Prialt). I would never let anyone turn down my opiates to nearly off without knowing what the plan was for when I inevitably go through withdrawals, nor would I do it when my doctor (or his associate) would not be available to respond if there were problems. I know some of the side effects of Prialt are CNS depressant symptoms, so perhaps one must go off of opiates prior to starting the Prialt. I do not know enough about this drug to know if the pump must be stopped and the person withdrawn off the opiates prior to starting Prialt or not. The patient should be completely aware of the entire plan before starting any of it. I agree, Charles, the pump and the SCS would not be choices for me either. Take care, Annette""If you are on methadone and oxycodone and you still have pain ""as bad as it has always been"", then either the meds need to be adjusted to a higher level so they do reduce your pain, or they don<APO>t work at all, and should be discontinued. If they have never worked, then you and your doctor might try something else. If they worked at first, then gradually stopped working, then they probably need to be adjusted upwards. Discuss this with your PM doctor. Since he is an excellent doctor and you two seem to get along well together, talk to him!! Take care, Annette""First, thank you for your service. My son spent eight years active duty in the Marines. It takes a lot of personal sacrifice to be in the military. However, suicide is never a good answer. Especially for your family. You might be comfortable leaving your daughter at a certain age, she will not likely ever feel comfortable about it. If you are thinking this way, you need to discuss it with your doctor, you may need to adjust your pain medicine doses, or you may need antidepressant therapy of some sort. If you are feeling this way and can<APO>t reach your doctor, please call 911. Take care, Annette""You have multiple issues here. 1. The Savella- this is a relatively new drug for FMS. But it is also an SNRI, it affects the same neurotransmitters as the effexor that you are already taking, serotonin and norepinephrine. (I would not take both of them myself, because of the risk of serotonin syndrome, and lack of medical evidence that taking more than one would be of any more benefit.) Many of the antidepressant drugs are also used for chronic pain of many kinds, FMS included. I would not be surprised that doctors are using the Savella for non-FMS pain, there is no reason it wouldn<APO>t work just as well as the other SNRIs. It is felt that the neurotransmitters that carry mood signals are the same ones that carry pain signals. Savella was brought to the market as a FMS drug, not as an antidepressant, I feel mainly because folks with FMS are tired of being given antidepressants for FMS, it makes them feel like the illness is all in their heads. My hubby took an SNRI for the chronic pain he had in just his hip until he finally was able to have it replaced. Then he tapered off of it. They do help with many kids of chronic pain, not just FMS. 2- The whole deal of opiates and addictive behaviour.- Had you not said that the PA might be correct about addictive leanings on your part, I would not have gone here at all. I do not know what you mean by ""enjoying it"" or by saying you have parts of you that think and act like an addict. If by enjoying it you mean you like having less pain, that is one thing. If you like a buzz or high that it gives you and sometimes take it for that reason, I would be very concerned. Perhaps you need to attend a NA meeting and really get to understand your own feelings about narcotics first of all. Then you may need to speak to your doctor in person rather than the PA, and get this all straightened out so you do not end up a full blown addict. If you decide you are not an addict, but rather someone who likes having less pain, I would still speak to the MD and deal with what opiates would be best for you. Perhaps a long acting opiate would give you even better relief than the short acting one. I would also question taking the Savella and the Effexor XR at the same time. Tell him your pharmacist also had concerns. Take care, Annette""Teresa said it better than I can, ditto what she said. I don<APO>t think it is a good idea to tell anyone besides your hubby what meds you take. It simply is not necessary, and if you end up on opiates like many of us do it is better to keep it to yourself for many reasons. Take care, Annette""I read further and see that you are already on opiates. Make sure they are kept in a secure place, not the bathroom cabinet or your nightstand. It is best to keep them looked up to prevent children from getting into them, and also to prevent theft. I still agree with Teresa about telling the in-laws the truth. Take care, Annette""I wouldn<APO>t waste my money on a chiro because I really believe it would be money thrown away with no relief for my pain. My hubby<APO>s chiro told me years ago before I had spinal surgery to stay away from chiros, they would not help with my DDD in my neck and could do more harm than good. I would see a pain management doctor first and try all the different kinds of oral meds or fentanyl skin patches that are available. I would only have surgery if I had a functional defecit happening and it sounds like you are complaining of pain for the most part. I would also see a cardiologist about the heart palpitations and see if they really are related to your neck. Many kinds of palpitations are benign and won<APO>t hurt you anyway. Take care, Annette""Glad to hear you are smart enough to plan a pregnancy and not just ""get pregnant"", lol. You should have a pre-pregnancy visit to your OB doctor for a pelvic exam and whatever tests are appropriate for you. That way you start out your pregnancy as healthy as possible. Many doctors suggest you get any dental work you might need taken care of before you get pregnant also. Discuss at that appt. whatever meds you are on and if they are safe for the baby. The OB doctor should be able to tell you how long before you start trying to get pregnant you should stop any meds that are not safe for you and the baby. Some women are taking meds that are very important for their health, and the doctor may decide that the risk of problems with the baby are so small that it is okay to take them, or some substitute drug. Some meds are okay to take later in the pregnancy but not at the beginning, so he may have you go off before you get pregnant, but you may be able to go back on a few months into the pregnancy. Sometimes headaches go away for the duration of the pregnancy due to hormone changes in your body, and you my find you don<APO>t need your meds as much. It is all hit and miss because we are all different. Discuss all this with your OB at your pre-pregnancy checkup. Take care, Annette""Sorry, no way to know what will work since we don<APO>t know what is causing it. Did it start with the work injury? If not, the neurologist seeing you for the work injury may not even check you over for the headaches. If it is a worker<APO>s comp insurance that covers that visit, they are usually very strict about only taking care of the job related problem. You might call the neurologist<APO>s office and ask them to put you on a cancellation list if they have one. That way if someone cancels their appt. they can give it to you instead. My hubby got into see a plastic surgeon (for a chronic leg wound evaluation , not for cosmetic surgery) in three days that way, instead of two and a half months. (Who says we don<APO>t have to wait for medical care in the US?) Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t know what your doses of your meds have been, or how much he is increasing them. I would just sit there with a friend or family member and tell him straight out that your meds are not working, that you need something more, and if he can<APO>t help you would he please refer you to someone else. Sadly, often doctors do more if the patient is not the only one in the room. Have your friend take notes quietly. Take care, Annette""I am concerned that you don<APO>t seem to be on any meds for your high blood pressure or your diabetes. That combination is a heart attack waiting to happen. Neuropathy in diabetics is often due to high blood sugars that are not being controlled properly. Neuropathy can cause both pain and numbness in the feet, which in turn can cause clumsiness. Opiates won<APO>t do much of anything for diabetic neuropathy unless you treat the diabetes and get the blood sugars down. Take care, Annette""Neuropathy can be caused by many things, your diabetes is only one. I would get the usual tests done, Vit, D and Vit,. B12 levels were done by my doctor when I had pain that she thought might be neuropathic. If your hemoglobin A1C is within normal limits, then your diet is working. That is the best test that I am aware of to check diabetes. They usually want your numbers to be within normal limits and your blood sugars are a just a little bit high. With all the meds you are on, the doctor may want to be on the conservative side with starting you on any more. You might take a list of all your meds to your pharmacist and ask him if any of them or any interaction between any of them could be causing any of your problems. For me, once the correctable causes of the neuropathy were ruled out, I did not need to know what might have triggered it. I just wanted to learn how to best manage it. I understand that sometimes you never know the cause of some medical conditions. I used to be a big Pepsi drinker also. I gave it up due to the caffeine. I drink a store brand, decaf, diet cola now when I feel the urge. Take care, Annette""I am confused, if you are already in pain management, and they are giving you methadone, tell them it isn<APO>t working and you would like to try something else. If by ""methadone program"" you actually mean a methadone program for treatment of opiate addiction that you were hoping would also take care of your pain, that is something else altogether. Please clarify. Take care, Annette""I would then suggest you see a psychiatrist. Get that out of the way. If he sees you and you are normal, then you can pass that on to the medical doctors when they tell you it is all in your head. If he sees you and finds something wrong, please be open to that and get treatment for it. Take care, Annette""Fibromyalgia does not cause people to pass out. It can<APO>t hurt to ask the doctors about it though. Perhaps you have more than one thing wrong with you. Are you serving in the military, or are you a military dependent? Take care, Annette""I would suggest you stop going to the ER, and pick a primary care doctor that you get along with. Let him oversee your care, and refer you to any specialists he feels are necessary. Stick with the one pcp and see what he can do to help you to figure this out. Take care, Annette""Please take her to the doctor. Take care, Annette""I was pretty sure sweating was not a side effect of adderall, but I looked it up in my drug handbook just to make sure. It<APO>s not. I also looked up NiaSpan, it is a fancy word for niacin, or Vit. B3. It doesn<APO>t cause sweating either according to my drug handbook, actually DRY skin is listed as one side effect. You did screw up by taking your mom<APO>s vicodin the same day you called the doctor<APO>s office. I doubt that there is anything you can do to fix things with this doctor either. Just be honest and hope he is kind enough to give you another chance. Otherwise, ask him what you can do (other than controlled substances) to help control your pain, and withdrawal symptoms. Take care, Annette""But, no state requires a doctor to prescribe opiates. This poster already was seeing a doctor for pain management, he messed up by taking another person<APO>s meds. I don<APO>t think his doctor is required to do anything in that kind of situation. Take care, Annette""Where are you going on Friday to get an x-ray and ""hopefully an MRI""? If you don<APO>t already have a doctor<APO>s order for the MRI and your doctor is on vacation, how are you going to get one done? The people x-raying you on Friday are just x-ray techs, they don<APO>t need to be sympathetic, just good at their jobs. Take care, Annette""I agree with you, first get a medical diagnosis, then look into chiropractic to see if it might help. I have DDD in my cervical region and I would never let a chiro near my neck. Even my husband<APO>s chiropractor told us after seeing my MRI to stay away from chiros, they simply cannot help me, and could harm me. However, years ago I had a lower back muscle pull at work. I went through all the medical treatments, meds and PT, etc. None helped. I finally went to see a chiro who had put on a presentation at my sister<APO>s gymnastics<APO> club. My sister was very impressed with this woman. I saw her for about 4 weeks, and felt huge improvement after the first adjustment. After one month she suggested maintenence appts. and I stopped going. I had no pain and full range of movement. She also fixed a headache I had one day when I went to see her using acupressure points on my hand. It worked instantly. So, get your medical diagnosis first, then IF your MD approves it, check out chiropractors. I do know that not all our members feel the same way, to each his own. Take care, Annette""If you call your local Arthritis Foundation office they should be able to tell you where the warm water pools are in your community that are used for arthritis patients. Those are the pools with the right temperatures that usually help rather than hurt FMS patients. Take care, Annette""What if it is not a migraine? My husband has a history of some migraines but they had not bothered him for quite awhile. He got a headache and assumed it was a migraine. After 5-6 days we had a big fight, because I wanted him to go to the doctor and he wouldn<APO>t. I won, he went and had a CT and he had a subdural hematoma. That is a long word for bleeding under the membrane that surrounds the brain. They watched it with serial CTs/MRIs and luckily it gradually shrank and reabsorbed. Otherwise he would have required surgery to remove the clot. He had had no head injury, and they never could tell us why he had that happen to him. ANY sudden, different headache should be evaluated by a doctor. He needs to go to the ER where they can do a scan and make sure his brain is okay. Have the fight, make him go. I am an old ER nurse with a husband who hates going to the doctor. We have agreed he will go if he breaks a long bone or has neurological changes. Or I will wait until he is asleep and call 911 myself, lol. After he goes and you get the bill from the ER, call the billing office at the hospital and ask if he is eligible for help through their ""indigent care"" program. They will often discount the price depending on financial status, or at least arrange payments. Take care, Annette""First, it is a good thing that the imaging and other tests are all normal. Lots of people with normal tests still have pain. I wouldn<APO>t get caught up in searching for a diagnosis or cause of the pain once you have had all the tests and they are normal. This pain sounds like it is going down the sciatic nerve. It may take awhile to find the right cocktail of meds that give you some relief, but it should happen eventually. I really believe in making appts. and going in and seeing the doctor face to face for medication changes. Most people take tramadol with SSRIs and do not have seizures, but if you aren<APO>t comfortable with this let him know. There are other options for treating both pain and depression. Once you find the mix of treatments that works for you, you won<APO>t need to go see the doctor as often. I see my doc once every three months. Take care, Annette""I don<APO>t have RSD, but I have other chronic pain conditions. Gail will probably answer your post, she was diagnosed with RSD, and hasn<APO>t had very good pain relief yet. Perhaps you two can help each other. Take care, Annette""I think there are plenty of good doctors around, but you have to search them out. I doubt you are going to find any doctor who is knowledgeable about both neurology and gynecology. A PCP will to a degree, but that is all. I would get a second opinion from both a neurologist and GYN and see what they say. Sometimes therapy does cause pain right after, if yours does then the doctor who is ordering it should give you pain meds so that you can do the PT without being miserable. Take care, Annette""It means you were given some kind of contrast when you had your xrays, and that your kidneys (both of them) are excreting (passing) the contrast. The contrast material can be given orally or through an IV. That is exactly what your kidneys are supposed to do. They get rid of toxins, and fluids through your urine. They basically clean the blood as it flows through them. Take care, Annette""I tried it about 12 years ago when I was first diagnosed with FMS. I had no improvement at all, I went for 8 weeks, once or twice a week. My MD said about 50% of his chronic pain patients had some relief and it usually lasted about 3 months, but then stopped working. He was very supportive of me trying it. Take care, Annette""If you had no relief at all after the first series, I would refuse to do it again. Too expensive for one thing. Why do any invasive treatment if you already had it with no relief at all? Find another doctor if he doesn<APO>t back down about this. Take care, Annette""You will just have to wait and see what comes back from the urine screen. You are right, it is always better to be honest. But, it is too late now for ""should have dones"". Take care, Annette""There is no way to know what a PM doctor will decide about your negative percocet test. All you can do is go and see what happens. Explain how you took the meds and hope he understands. In future be sure to always take your meds exactly as prescribed. Take care, Annette""Keep the food diary and note the times you move your bowels and whether it was hard, soft, watery, etc. Note in your diary if your pain is less after you move your bowels, that may help the doctor make a diagnosis. Jot down when you have pain and score it 0-10, 10 being the worst. Note anything that makes it better or worse, sitting, laying down, eating specific foods, meds, etc. If the pain is at night and keeps you awake, you can write that down. If you can fall asleep while in pain, write that down. You can keep your diary in a small notebook on your bedside table. Keep seeing the doctor, if necessary ask to see a GI specialist. If you stop going to the doctor, he assumes you are better. Ask him exactly what he thinks may be wrong and write it down. If he gives you any meds, ask him how long you should take them before feeling an improvement, if it doesn<APO>t happen, go back and see him again. No one can diagnose you on line, you must keep seeing the doctor to get an accurate diagnosis. Take care, Annette""Read my post just before yours in this thread. I would do the same thing if I were you. Do you have the abdominal pain all the time or does it come and go? Is it similar to the discomfort you have with your pain due to stress? Are you having any constipation, or diarrhea? Go to the ER if the pain is severe, if you have a fever along with it, or if you judge it to be necessary. Otherwise keep your appt. with your doctor. Take care, Annette""I would ask to have the test repeated. You might also speak to someone at the testing lab and ask them what might turn up a false positive for fentanyl. Take care, Annette""If you feel he is weeding out Medicare patients, you might also report him to Medicare. Ask them what they would suggest you do. Did you get a copy of this test, if not you should, then call the lab that did the test and ask them more about how this would happen. Take care, Annette""Although measuring your legs<APO> circumference and comparing the two would be interesting and may help the doctor come to a diagnosis, there can be other reasons for a thinner leg besides nerve problems. A decrease in circumference means the muscles are smaller in that leg, many conditions can cause that, and often once fixed, the muscles will build up again and be the same on both legs. It is something that is used in conjunction with other tests and exam findings. You might keep a pain diary, using the 0-10 score. Note the onset of pain and anything that might have triggered it. Note all meds you take with the dose and time you take them, score the pain again about 2 hours later. Take this to your doctor also. Take care, Annette""If you don<APO>t feel strong enough to fight, then take a friend or family member with you to the appt. to help you stand up for yourself. It does little good to tell the nurse a pill didn<APO>t work when you tried it before, if the doctor is the one with the RX pad. You can tell him now that you have tried it again and it doesn<APO>t work. The cymbalta you are taking, as well as the amitriptylline are both used off label for chronic pain. My husband used cymbalta for a couple of years as part of his pain management program and it did help along with his opiates. The amitriptylline also helps many people get a decent night<APO>s sleep. Both are antidepressants. So many of the drugs they use today have multiple purposes. I would ask your pharmacist to advise you about the symptoms of serotonin syndrome as a number of your meds taken together can trigger it. It is not a common thing, and will usually subside as soon as you stop the meds. I hope the appt. went okay. Take care, Annette""Talk to your doctor about them. They are not uncommon, and there are prescription medications you can take to prevent them from happening. Take care, Annette""I would start with your family doctor for pain management. As long as he is able to help your husband control his pain, it sounds reasonable to me. My primary care doctor manages my chronic pain and has for a bit over ten years now. When he gets to the point where the family doctor cannot manage it anymore, then he may need to see a pain management doc. A neurologist would probably cost as much as a pain management specialist. An orthopedic specialist is the other kind of specialist that sees back problems, but they are not trained in managing chronic pain at all, they do surgery. Hopefully, by then you either will have health insurance or this country will have joined the rest of the civilized world in providing health care for all of its citizens. Check with your state department of disability and vocational rehabilitation for help with your husband finding alternative job skills. They help people with health issues change jobs by providing them with retraining or education. Take care, Annette""Not necessarily. My doctor lets her chronic pain patients take all their neurontin at one time at bedtime rather than taking multiple doses during the day. She says her patients seem to get the same level of pain control either way. I have been doing it for nearly ten years now. I took them at bedtime first, then moved the time up to about 4-5 hours prior to bedtime because I felt somewhat lethargic in the daytime. It is definitely something you should discuss with your doctor first. Take care, Annette""I have not gained any weight. I did notice some craving for sweets, but I allow myself one serving of ice cream a day, and ignore any other cravings by doing or eating something else. If your doctor lets you take the whole dose at bedtime and that works for you, I don<APO>t think 4 pills at one time is too much to swallow. Whatever works.
